{"text": "A Vampire's Guide to Dummies Do you feel emancipated by the twenty-first century? Have you lost your cutting edge? Do you find yourself drinking the blood of mice and think ' Why? You may have already read 'A Zombie's Guide to Attaining Zen' and 'A Skeleton's Guide to Overcoming Anorexia' but this, the third in the series, is as much help-yourself as self-help. It is about our shared passion; food, and how best to meet it. I'd like to thank you for taking an interest in where your food comes from and how best to source something to suck on. There is a wide range of flavours available to vampires but Dummies are the most representative of mortal dishes. Like Big Macs to human children, we all know how a Dummy tastes. That sweat of desperation, the slight lard of overeating ice-cream on the sofa, the rich lethargy of their blood. Stella. Intelligence always made the human bitter. Look at Nietzsche, yes; but don't taste him. Dummies are formed by stupid parents, an insipid childhood and, most often, reality T.V. They think vampires foppish, young, refined, and entirely alike Robert Pattinson. As a newly turned vampire, you will still be stumbling against this clich'. Female teenagers won't give you the time of day, let alone night. Amongst film stars, people tell me I resemble Darth Vader, after he takes off his mask. (The skin tone comes from spending too long in the dark.) Words don't really fit me. The word 'corpulent' could have been coined for my gut but is not multi-syllabic enough and does not encompass it. Very little does and I used to have to shop by catalogue. Thank God for Amazon. The human form, though, is the focus of this guide, and where best to source it. And where better than in the City, on a summer's evening, as dusk rots the sky? The girls in their slight dresses, passing like sirens freed from their calling. The jiggle of their hems, of their bosoms. The strong, young men; their nape and shoulder muscles poised like the wings of eagles on the air. The City, in the summer, makes a simile of everything and the motion of human limbs, in the dying light, is as pleasant as any rhyme. Always eat the beautiful and you can tell, just by looking and listening around, that the most beautiful are also the most stupid. There are three ways of defining the Dummy food-group. 1) What a Dummy is Not. New vampires are drawn to a certain type of food. You will want to eat the vibrant, the strong. Drink blood barely held in check by its veins. I like late night cafes with large windows and my voyeur's pleasure of the twenty-first century is the Chav. They are the big cats of the human race ' its big game. The Chav, though, is an occasional snack. While they represent good calorific value (their bloodstream contains four-fifths of the RDBI - Recommended Daily Blood Intake) they are exceptionally tenacious livestock. According to research, the calorie-cost of subduing a Chav is often more than the benefit of supping on one. Still, an Americano warming your frigid palms, you will find yourself gazing at them, drinking them in as they pass in gangs, having discarded black, Nike hoodies for shaven heads and chequered, short-sleeved shirts. You will rise, as I so often have, and follow one into an alley, as he looks to leave his last drink on the cobbles, via his bladder. When you do, there exists a combination of techniques (recommended by most vampire masters) used to prepare this plate. Any good Nocturnal Arts class can train you in these, until they become muscle memory. Practise the moves with a dummy (not a real one, of course). Diagrams are in the appendices. First, he will unzip. You will clutch at him, grasping his wide, pink, sun-spanked throat. Pull him close until you can feel the muscles of his back writhing against your gut. The Chav will curse, and butt back his head. You say; 'Hold still, please.' Say, also; 'Stop fighting it, sir.' You wrap your legs around his hips, topple him to the side, and roll on the ground, behind cardboard boxes, green skips and black bags. The Chav will fight like he has always known how, since he was six. But he has also always been beaten and, at the end, will go limp, apart from the motion of his tears. Then sup. As noted, a Chav is not a Dummy but a treat and, though it is important to indulge oneself once in a while, afterwards - pop a Rennie. Chavs give me indigestion. It's not that I don't like them, but that they don't like me. 2) The Male Dummy My more everyday evenings are spent in lap-dancing clubs near the centre of the City. They throb with flesh, with neon lights, and with lines of magnetism that draw the Dummies in. This is the place to buffet. I eat salted peanuts by the bar and try to ignore the women. From time to time, I may prospect one for a private dance, so as to blend in, but tell them I'm an arse man. I recommend the bottom dance. It does the appetite no good when you are enveloped in the down of their breasts, in the scratch of their areola, in the probing of their nipples. All your skin will feel is the throb above each, the clanging of blood like church bells in her jugular. If you can, take a friend. I feel that dining is demeaning, when done solo, but with company the evening often runs fluidly. I sit with Frank. 'Not interested in the jugs, eh, Adrian?' Frank says. He smiles. He does this when he talks to me, sitting on the tall, clinging stools. The leather sucks at you when you stand, as pity does. Frank talks in puns, as a", "label": 1}
{"text": "boring parent does. 'More of a bum man, eh? They can't lock the door on you can they, the hoboes?' 'Yes, Frank,' I say, and pretend to be looking at Ruby, Queen of Persia, and all she has to offer. Instead, I look at the door. It's Stock Exchange ringing out time. 'The FTSE's been massaged, now they want to be,' Frank says. A tide will come in. A Red Sea closing, of investment bankers, hedge funders, open armed investment managers, shorters, speculators, portfolio re-engineers. Dummies out on the City that suckles them. 'Bottoms up,' says Frank. I don't like it when he talks. Frank was not how one would wish to be turned. A straight man's bad dream; moustached, leather clad, he maintains a relationship with B.O. that has several unhealthy issues, many of which come from his crotch. I often eat peanuts, when he speaks, to stop the wincing. But he showed me where the butchers are, and now I show you. Together, we window shop. Do not browse for the alpha males, slapping rump and pressing the Queen's crinkled face into places her majesty would rather not see. Instead, cast your greed to the group's tattered hem. The newbies. The greens. Young men straight out of Oxbridge who have not yet fitted in. Awkward grins long and loose and rubbery, holding their drinks with two hands to stop the shaking. Still, they drink quicker than the rest. Soon, they will be drunk and you will enjoy doing it. I recommend the toilet. Open a conversation with a comment on one of the dancers; a line that encompasses her curves. Say; 'that Ruby's a bit of alright', or 'I wouldn't mind a slap and tickle with that Sapphire', or 'When Diamond bent over I wet myself, but it wasn't urine, if you know what I mean', etc' A male in a toilet has to respond to these amuse bouche or be thought homosexual, which is not the impression to give in the Gents. Even better, say it in a northern accent. From there, convince them that a dancer wants a private audience, because they are so young and pretty and special. Say; 'That Emerald, I caught her looking at you. I'm a bit of regular here, reckon I could get you a private room.' (Add 'lad', or 'son', if you think you can get away with it.) A man falls for this, a highly educated human, before he realises that 'special' was a word concocted for children who don't understand 'retarded'. If he does fall, you will walk into the private booth you booked and because you, like me, are as ugly as a vampire can be, his callow, whiskey soaked eyes will flinch across you. And if you are like me, which is to say obese, you will subdue him with a lap-dance more forceful, heftier, than he had been imagining. And the breasts in his face are moobs, and unexpected, and it isn't long before his Bambi body is broken, and your belly thickens. 3) The Female Dummy Never, and can I make this clear, never attempt to eat a woman you do not know. They start at the presumption, no matter how ugly the lady, that all men are predators. This is not conducive to hunting. Women are rare creatures, and rare feasts, and not, for once, in the bloody sense. For ladies, I used to use Facebook. The majority of women who are raped, are raped by men they know or, I would suppose, thought they knew. Facebook is a wonderful way to convince them that they do. I have several profiles, some male, some female, some homosexual. The pictures are cropped from Google Images. Once one is nettled in a friendship group, it's amazing how everybody thinks you are someone else's acquaintance. I spread myself around, using all the tricks they warn children about, but not adults. Did you know, 75% of human children who are sexually abused, are violated by someone they know? Preying on the familiar is so the way to go. I have Stupidophillia. In the main, I turn the subject of threads to my love of the Twilight series. 'I real respect Edward, he's so cool, it must be real hard for him,' I post, having Wikipediaed the books. I was unable to read them. 'Yeah, I no how u feel. Sometimes the hardest thing 2 do is the best thing. Sometimes, u cant have what u want, and it makes u thirstier for it, but somehow its better,' she replies. 'I no right what you mean.' 'You're the only man I no who gets it.' '8-) I think we can actually learn something from vampires. No I sound crazy. But I do.' 'Yeah, same here.' We, after several months, arrange to meet. Yes, a long incubation period for the maggot to turn into a fly, but you have to imagine several of these 'relationships' gaining wings at the same time. Twilites, I call them. Light meals, not too stodgy, you can do things afterwards, enjoy the rest of your evening. Nothing worse than a full roast on a summer's night. We meet in Starbucks. (Please note; women find coffee less intimidating, on a first date, than alcohol.) I ask her to wear something red, around her throat, so that I will know her. The insect tends to writhe on the hook of this meeting for at least an hour. I sat regarding this one for two hours, as she waited for somebody who looked entirely unlike my ugliness. She wept a little, and in public, and a group of young women pointed at her and whispered. One laughed and my victim-to-be left in a tirade of clothing and a line of cravat. She looked like someone whose faith in humanity had been shattered. A bit quick on conclusions, humans. She wasn't paying attention as she reached her flat, and didn't lock the door. It would be insensitive to", "label": 1}
{"text": "describe what happened within. I followed her down an unlit hall, past a white framed, single paned window, past a shelf of self-help manuals and Indie, vampire-themed tomes. I linger and trace my fat finger down two of their flimsy, thin spines: 'Fangs for the Laughs: a Vampiric Comic's Career' and 'What a Missed Stake: How Vampirism is just, plain Sucky'. You can tell they are cheap by the low page-count and the high number of puns. Still, they gave me the idea for this dummies guide. You can tell me if it's a good one, momentarily, when we meet. I turn to the kitchen. I am light-footed and can creep, for an obese man. (I am not weighted by a soul.) She slumped on a chair beside a small, wooden table and fell forward into her own arms, crying. Her sobs were loud and I feared the neighbours might be roused, before seeing the regular, red gashes like prison time up her arms and realising that this kitchen had heard it all before. The cupboards were worn, the shelves listless. Her arms, as I was watching them, continued around to clutch at her back, not so much hugging as trying to stab. I could hear tight cotton tearing. 'You're right,' I said. Her nails stopped, her hands became claws; furtive, stunned animals trapped by her elbow joints. 'You could learn from vampires.' She attempted to turn but I leant the weight of my chest upon her nape. She tried to scream but the weight, as I knew it would, crushed her lungs into withered leaves. I slammed her head, once, against the small, wooden table. A book toppled onto the floor, face up. 'New Moon,' it said, and it looked eared and resigned, like an old dog. I could hear panting, but it was her. She was bleeding from her nose. This distressed me. Impatient, I bit and sucked at her nostrils and she jolted in her Ikea chair, wetting the white, tea stained cushion and soiling her summer skirt. All I could smell was the red stuff. Rich and layered with a hint of musk. They say men age like a fine wine (they didn't meet my father; he aged like a puddle of piss: a dirty, dark glaze in the centre of his eyes, wrinkling and brown-spotted at the edges, stinking all the way through). Women age like a port. Fortified, yes, but all the more intoxicating for it. I could hear her squelching as she writhed, until she stopped. You're hungry now, aren't you? Before I left I walked through the lounge to the bathroom, picking my feet between discarded books. The lounge had the look of a struggle. Above the sink, the electric light came on, but seemed reluctant. Since I've been gone, it's been a relief not to stare at my face. In my day-life, I was an estate agent and the crap of it all had begun to rub off. Cleaning up after dear, old daddy hadn't helped. I looked like shit, alive. No doubt I look worse now, but not to me. I floss. Some pointers on dining decorum: * Always carry floss. We may be descended from medieval Eastern-European savages, but we are not barbarians. It is anti-social to spend the evening with larynx hanging from your teeth. * Wear a dark suit, and a shirt a shade lighter. Dark cloth is not an aesthetic choice, as you can imagine. First, it hides the sweat patches of a fight. Second, it hides stains. Blood can be absurdly difficult to remove. * If you do dribble, I suggest lemon juice and cold water. Do not use hot water, do not. It sets the stain. Then, as Buffy herself might have said, hang the article on a line that will receive direct sunlight; it will finish the job for you. * And, of course, don't forget your Rennies. * And don't forget to look behind you. No, don't look up, not yet. Keep reading, please do. Dummies read self-help guides, didn't you know? Why do you think I wrote this? From my point of view, it's not exactly life-enhancing. Research reveals that 97% of self-help readers are so gullible they'll believe anything, and that stat was made up. You're vampire curious, but you're not one as yet, and on that I'm 100%. The best thing about this Vampires Guide to Dummies (apart from the excellent writing, yes, thank you) is that it led me straight to you. It's been faster than Facebook, and the less said on Twitter the better. Either you shopped direct, and that gave me your address, or I watched you browsing in Indie bookstores from my blacked-out 2CV, with your dirty little self-help purchases; watched you pay, watched you leave. Followed you home. There's no bigger Dummy than someone who thinks they can change. What is it with humans and vampires? You want to be like us, do you? The most I can offer is: dead. Some final tips; Stay still. The skin of your throat is soft as I run my nails across it. The finest of hairs lift up onto my finger-tips. Does that tickle? My nails are short. They don't grow anymore. Try not to soil yourself. This will feel uncomfortable, like having a tooth removed from your throat. No need to add the smell of faeces to your discomfort. Can you smell my chest, instead, as it presses against your back? I'm wearing Old Spice. Nice. If you experience sexual excitement, even as you die; if you harden, or quicken, do not go red. The body acts in unusual ways to unusual stimulus. You would not be the first to orgasm as you pass out. Go with the flow, it won't be the only part of you that does.

{"text": "A Zombie's Guide to Attaining Zen You may have already read A Skeleton's Guide to Beating Bulimia, subtitle: Don't Eat, and A Vampire's Guide to Dummies or Who to Suck and When to Suck Them. This is the third in a series of self-improvement manuals for the no longer living and dares to ask why settle for being a sheep in the undead herd? Tired of wandering the highways, you may have stumbled upon this guide in a service station just outside Coventry. Perhaps you have been recently bitten. The fever is setting in, and you are looking, with sweat scoured eyes, to prepare yourself for the afterlife. Maybe you have risen from the place where you were gnawed by another. You have then glanced down and realised that your skin is paler than it should be and that your blood appears to be on the floor along with your entrails. Go on, grab those guts and suck them back up. Nothing stops a zombie except, perhaps, negativity. Log straight onto Amazon and order this manual, which is 99p on offer or '2.99, next day delivery. And check out the 5* reviews! It is time to be the zombie that you can be, the self-actualised zombie. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs As a teenage girl, I always wanted to be a writer but my first publication did not come until I was post-mortem. My guide is derived from the Hierarchy of Needs by Maslow and is applied to zombies. Why have I written it? One of these three reasons, take a guess. a) To give a little back to the species that infected me with the wandering disease. b) I have a dream where the living and the dead co-exist peaceably under a post-apocalyptic sky. Where little Freddie and dead Freddie, side by side, can play on the swings in the playground. c) People say only the most famous writers are read after they are dead. I think that I have talent. This is my best shot at immortality, writing and never dying. I will give you a clue; it is neither a) nor b). A little about the author Being a zombie is straightforward. We stumble, chew, crouch, chew, lie down, chew, craw and snap desperately at thin air. Me, I have always been different. While I still did, I lived on the edge. Even dead, I am more alive than most nine-to-five stiffs. I was a child that drank juice from cracked glasses, hoping to cut my lip. I learnt early to brew tea and make coffee for my parents. I would fill their mugs to the brims in the hope of scalding my feet on the way up the stairs. I carried the mugs two at a time. When I grew old enough, I was still underage, I became attracted to the bad boys. If only I had liked them clean-cut with a high hairstyle, jutting chin and cheekbones. Instead, the bad boy I was attracted to had holes where he should not, awful oral hygiene and the tendency of a leper to drop bits of himself on my bedroom floor. The first night together he ate me but not in the way that would make me a woman. As you can imagine, my parents were horrified, until I ate them, too. 1. Food No how-to guide is complete without at least one table. This is the table in my dead parent's house, in our kitchen. It is a table of contents, the contents of a human body, and it shows the proportion and order in which you should eat your prey. \\ ' ' ' ' But how best to hunt? For day to day requirements live near major studios - Pinewood, Hollywood or the BBC in Manchester if you are on a budget. The living are fascinated with the dead, and there is never a shortage of films, TV series and documentaries about the habits of your day-to-day zombie. What humans do not realise is that we sometimes act in these. I have. Do not, and I cannot stress this enough, take a lead on one of these productions. Be an extra. Why not? - As Ricky Gervais accurately portrayed, nobody notices the extra. - Working as an extra gives access to the other extras. If an extra dies, nobody notices. See the above point. - In the background of these films there are always scenes of zombie extras disembowelling other extras. Find a role for yourself as a disemboweller. The worst that will happen is that the director will become annoyed at just how authentic the screams of the disembowelled have become. To avoid, it is best to start with their larynxes. Extras are to be seen and not heard and seen only out of focus. I wish that were the case with human children. Never eat a human child. These are the only demographic, apart from celebrities, that humans actually care about. A missing child is like a missing front tooth; everybody notices. 2. Safety We are dead. What more can happen to you? Just do not get shot in the head. It is not much to ask, is it? 3. Social Contact The social side of the afterlife is usually underestimated. According to Government studies, those who are lonely in old age are 19% more likely to die prematurely than those who have good social bonds. And, with the already dead, the effects are exacerbated. No wonder we like to herd. Even digging our hands into the guts of humans and smearing their entrails across our cheeks is good for a little physical contact, sometimes it is all we have. Herding, though, is not conducive to longevity because there is always a human hanging around with a machine gun and several clips full of rounds. Something about the massed ranks of the undead, swaying and gnashing and looking for human flesh to eat, engenders animosity. I recommend spending quality time with the living.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Not only do you get your fix of human contact but there is always convenient dining. If you pick your time, it is fine to have a bite of the hand that feeds you or even a gulp. How to socialise Do not speed date. There is nothing quick about the zombie and how they pursue prey. Use cattle markets, nightclubs where the middle aged dance with the moves we zombies would call walking. See it as the ballroom of a Jane Austen adaptation but with more bosoms that sag. Glory in the rules of the dance, the furtive glance, the surreptitious touch and luring them into an alleyway to be eaten. Note that the last feature is not borrowed from Pride and Prejudice. I hate to break it to you, especially if you are a newly turned zombie, but the wrinkles are coming. The fissures will soon be everywhere. Expect serious damage to the neck, forehead and eye-line. You will have to be careful about what you eat. Chocolate stains the teeth but fudge and toffee tend to work your cheeks free. The gaping holes in your face mean only one thing to humans. You want to eat them. Here is how to maximise what remains you have left: 1) The appraisal. Be brutally honest with your naked self. Cut eye-slits in a paper bag and put it over your head. Look at your body and really take in where it is going to potholes. 2) Use hair-shaping clay, the type you can buy from any good salon, and work this into the gaps. If you have fissures in the skin on the skull, do not forget to take off the paper bag. 3) Once, like a sculptor, you have built up your face into something resembling the living, this is the time to add foundation. For that actual living tissue look, use L'Oreal, the kind that has built in self-moisturising and UVA-resistant tanning agents. 4) To this, brush on a fair application of blusher. Think English rose at dawn, covered by the lightest of dews, not shotgun-to-the-face victim. We have all seen plenty of these. Over-rouged is not comely. 5) Try not to worry too much about other bodily sores. If you are a male zombie, these will be covered. If you are a woman, men rarely mind, providing you are pretty and your breasts and buttocks have not rotted away, or popped due to a build up of putrefaction. Men like them moist, they tell me, especially in the aforementioned clubs. So a little rotting is no bad thing. When men are drunk, the smell even lures them in. 6) Put on a wig and secure it directly to the skull. Staples are good for this. The Zoo - an anecdote The world inside the nightclub is blurred. The lights from fly-eye bulbs are either caught in the smudged charcoal silhouettes of dancers or swallowed by the graveyard mist on the floor. The noise in The Zoo sounds as lost as the lights look blurred. The music is increasingly meaningless, curdled beats. I walk toward the centre of the dance floor and give my hips leeway to sway. I wear flats. I am tall and do not benefit from high heels. My dress is ankle length and blue. My eyeliner and nail polish match the fabric and the zircon sparkle of the dress. I look like an ocean under a midnight moon and I smell like old fish or would if I was not soaked in Chanel. I do not need to drink to appear uncoordinated or to fit in. My eyes roll of their own accord. The spittle on my bottom lip makes me look like someone spiked with Rohypnol. The music has shaken my left ear loose. Thankfully, the staples that keep on my wig have gone all the way through. My earlobe is skewered to my cheek. It is the summer, and I am not wearing much. Daft Punk is playing. They sing about women being there for fun and men looking for women. I am here for some brain. Dried up as a sand-hole where snakes used to breed I may be but I am still a woman where it counts. My curves have not sloughed off with the migrations of my skin. I will use them to tempt men at closing time. I am lucky. I died young and in my sleep. The zombie that took me ate the parts that are private. I dance. Men close in. I sway toward them and away. It is difficult to keep my lips off their cheeks when they lean in and speak to me. I cannot hear them but I smile, tightly because I do not want to stretch my cheeks or push my teeth through my skin. A man leans close. He wears a tight white t-shirt and has sweat on his forehead. When he speaks, I smell rum and blood. I do not want to be near him and I walk away. The man shouts, and I look back. I do not meet his gaze but I look, and he sees me looking. It is closing time, and I pass outside. My make-up has run, as has my ear. I think I must have left it on the dance floor. I do not frown or swear. My face is a Botox mask. I am afraid to show emotion lest it cracks and the fa'ade falls off. I walk past the frontage of the nightclub. My left eye is turned slightly upward, and I see the 'oo' of 'Zoo'. I turn left into an alley and walk between bin bags full of rubbish. The man who sleeps next to the bin bags smells like he uses himself as a toilet. Tight-white-t-shirt is following. He pushes me against the wall, and I allow him to do this. I have eaten two tubes of extra strong mints so he does not smell the rot on", "label": 1}
{"text": "my breath [TS1]He pushes his lips against my face. I wrap my arms as far around his back as I am able. I do not need to hold him tight. When my incisors are spliced through his jaw-line, my teeth will hold him,[TS2]. We kiss. He is eager, and his tongue is active and lively. I wonder if he notices how my canines rock in their housings or the long hole in the arc of my mouth. The feel of my right breast distracts him. I am glad he has not chosen my left. It is plastic and a flap of skin awkwardly stitched. I suck his tongue down my throat, and his eyes open. He is surprised, and I watch him thinking[TS3] about what might be next, a blowjob perhaps. I sink my teeth in his face and kiss him with some passion. I eat at his face until I have punctured the frontal skull. I taste his cerebral cortex. Blowjobs do not involve blowing but sucking. I have known this since I was a teenager. I suck now and I ease his brains out from his head and into my throat. 4. Self Esteem Nothing prepares you better for being a zombie than becoming a teenager although girl is preferable for maximum effect, the greasy-hair, body odours and the feeling that your body has been repossessed, that it was only ever lent to you. [TS4]For sprouting pubic hair think fissures appearing in every plane of your skin. And there is the trepidation of stepping out into the street. It is difficult to maintain a casual gait when non-zombies are laughing at you, and zombies have long been mocked for the way we walk. Zombies are forever one false move away from tripping, and, with bones as brittle as our own, falling on your face can completely flatten it. Too many zombies find self-esteem beyond them but there is an effective way of becoming one with your new body. Helpful advice follows but, first, what needs to be avoided: 1) Art Abstract Finger Painting In The Style Of Munch classes work for some but not others. There have been serious casualties. Red paint on the fingers inevitably reminds zombies of their favourite feeding. When the less responsible tutors encourage zombies to open up their artistic fugue, the consequences are not always positive. When I did this, I absentmindedly walked away and chewed the shoulders of co-attendees. By the third session, I had to handcuff my ankles to the easel. Despite serious accidents, the classes persist but do not be surprised by seeing fellow zombies in chains. 2) Martial Arts According to kreimers-karate.com, the 'mental' benefits of martial arts are: * improved concentration for better work and study habits * stress reduction and the ability to relax * a positive attitude toward life through self-confidence and self-discipline * increased self-esteem * new respect for yourself and those around you * enhanced motivation and 'I Can Do It' attitude Despite exercise being great at relaxing muscles rigoured by death, sparring for zombies cannot be recommended. Proponents argue that exercise is good for the soul but this is redundant for the un-dead. In order to transfer maximum power to the forearms and lower legs, most fighting styles are based on snapping actions originating around the hips,[TS5]. That, though, can lead to this, 3) Power Yoga. The typical zombie body is not capable of Power Yoga. In my first session, three fingers fell off my left hand. With some difficulty I wrapped the fingers in my yoga mat and left early. Power Yoga is addictive. Zombies, who should know better, return for further punishment. The fees demanded in advance are a possible explanation. Like others, I returned. But in the next session, in the butterfly position, my bingo wings, which had been developing since my skin had slackened, flapped off onto the varnished wooden floor and skittled across to a large woman. The wings sat next to her like two discarded, deep-fried chicken bits in their own grease. I will never forget her wailing in horror and sitting in her own pool of sweat. Yoga, though, does make a zombie feel alive. But zombies who want to retain limbs need to be cautious. The recommended, zombie-friendly exercise Yoga For The Older is usually available at the local nursing home. In these senior yoga classes, a zombie can let it all hang out. In my class, no one, except me, batted an eyelid. One of mine had worked loose. Occasionally, OAPs keel over with coronaries in mid-class. This never happens in normal yoga, which is a shame. Young brains are juicier. But the stillness of yoga is essential for helping zombies find a space in the relentless schedule of walk-walk-eat. It also benefits the spine and posture. Breathe from your belly and you will be able to stagger in a straight line. 5. Actualisation The Guardian should be the paper of choice for the discerning un-dead, that is vampires, zombies and poltergeists. The wights prefer the Daily Mail, as you may have guessed, and it is impossible to separate a werewolf from his copy of the Daily Star or Sport. Werewolves are particularly partial to exposed nipples. Personally, I am indebted to the excellent Stuart Heritage for his Guardian article 'Transcendental Meditation: does it work?'. Heritage maps out the range of paths to transcendence. Predictably, the paths do not involve walking[TS6]. Here, I have organised them into a table and rated them for their effectiveness. Transcendence Technique Effectiveness A flotation tank. Suspension in a bath of salted water while listening to whale music. Not good for the skin, especially for the dead, who begin to bloat and to resemble a body brought up by scuba divers. How I normally look but more green. Observation of the self. There is a safety check for lepers, called Visual Surveillance Of Extremities. Lepers can run a wary eye over their own extremities, making sure nothing is cut", "label": 1}
{"text": "that could get infected or go gangrenous. Meditation teaches the same awareness, to monitor and hold-in-mind not only each area of your body but also your thoughts. If I was a leper; I would be sorely dispirited. There are gaping holes everywhere. Do not do this. It will only lead to disappointment. Transcendental Meditation. Instructors, who are found through the TM website, teach zombies how to construct a secret mantra to unlock internal bliss and how to centre transcendence on repeated words. The course, which is explained in detail on their website, lasts for 4 evenings. TM.org do deliver what they promise. Unfortunately, instructors are prone to being eaten by pupils. I ate mine, who was called Bob, before the second lesson was completed,[TS7] Bob was delicious but, like all takeaways, Bob did not represent value for money. But there are worse diets than eating transcendentalism coaches. What happened to the big bad wolf and Cinderella should be remembered. The Story of The Big Bad Wolf and Cinderella and The Fat Fourth Step Sister There once was a wolf that was big and hungry and morally suspect. Because of his hunger, the wolf wandered nearer to the city than usual. There he came across Cinderella who was digging a hole for the kitchen rubbish.. [TS8] 'Why,' said the wolf, 'isn't it lucky to find you here digging a hole with a shovel, little girl? It gives me somewhere to hide your bones when I've finished licking them clean.' The wolf opened his mouth wide to show Cinderella what big teeth he had and to bite her. 'You're right Mister Wolf,' said Cinderella. 'You couldn't have said it better. I am a little girl and too small to satisfy a big bad wolf. But I have four stepsisters. They are very fat and they would keep you full all winter. If you wait here, I will bring the fattest to you.' 'Oh, little girl, you lie to me. If I let you go you'll run home and get your daddy who, I bet, earns his living as a woodcutter or some such.' 'I am Cinderella and a good girl and I only speak the truth.' The wolf considered this and the little girl. She did look like the Cinderella in the stories and the wolf knew that Cinderella was such a goody-goody she even had a fairy Godmother. The wolf said, 'Okay, but, if you lie to me, I'll dress up as an elderly relative and eat you next time there is a family gathering.' Cinderella nodded and returned home and told her fourth and fattest stepsister that she would no longer dig holes in the forest. Her stepsister yelled and grabbed Cinderella by her ponytail. The stepsister dragged Cinderella out to where the wolf waited. The wolf jumped onto the stepsister and ate her chubby face. 'Sorry to disturb you,' said Cinderella. 'But the hole I dug is perfectly comfortable and it is the very best place to eat obese step sisters.' The wolf nodded and dragged the fat screaming stepsister into the hole. He ate what was left of the fat stepsister. Soon the wolf discovered that his belly had swollen and that now the hole was too small. The wolf was stuck. Cinderella stood at the side of the hole and smiled down at the wolf. 'Excuse me, little girl,' said the wolf, 'could I have that shovel so I can dig myself out?' Cinderella smiled again. 'Yes, of course,' said Cinderella, 'you can have the shovel, Mister Wolf.' Cinderella leaned over the hole and brought the shovel down on the head of the wolf. She battered and battered and the wolf roared and roared and his brains leaked and leaked from his skull until the wolf was paralysed. The wolf died of starvation. Recommended diets Self-actualisation for a zombie does not mean becoming a traditional Zen master. Zombies do not sit cross-legged, chant and become one with the universe. Transcendence is achieved by a zombie when he is bent double and eating human flesh and not when chanting, 'Zohm'' But you must be mindful of whose minds you consume. You are what you eat. If the big bad wolf had eaten the clever little girl, he would not have squirted his brains onto his ears. In quite a Zen way, our Hierarchy of Needs is not a triangle, but a circle. Food is the all-consuming driver of zombie behaviour. Browse for brains in bookshops and libraries. What your meals read will have a direct impact on the nutritional value of their grey matter. I have composed a top five list of reading material for meals. When I see someone perusing these authors, my tongue perks up, and I find it hard not to start hissing, what with the dribble. 5) J K Rowling ' although a beautiful mind, particularly when depressed, too many of her readers are are [TS9]simply addled Hogwart addicts. Young brains are juicy but you do not want to feel that you are eating a teenager when chewing an adult. This is confusing, and zombies do not want confusion in their brains, their own that is. Talking of Rowling brain, I rarely snack on minds blackened by depression. They can cause severe indigestion. Rowling in her early thirties, living in a one-bedroom council flat, though, would have been a genuine delicacy. 4) William Burroughs - particularly Naked Lunch. His readers have to be as flexible and relaxed as the anal muscles of the protagonists. The brains of his readers just slip down. 3) George R Martin- so much going for his readers, a demographic informed by his lively wit and detail but there is something of the herd in many of them. Eating his readers can be like chewing the brains of sheep. 2) Demosthenes- the purity of expression and the oratorical tools of this great speaker produce a kind of rhythm in the digestion. Like hiccups, but backwards. Demosthenes is addictive, not like", "label": 1}

These readers have flexible minds, and their brains fall apart on the tongue like well-marinated lamb. Stalk horror anthology launches where everybody is over-friendly.

Without flexibility chewing becomes impossible. Might as well eat matches, but do not expect the spark. 3) Voltaire. Too many of his his[TS11] readers have crispy brains like overcooked bacon left to solidify in fat. These people read to impress and not to grow. But not all Voltaire readers are like this. Those who read him in French are quite tasty. I avoid those who read him in translation as I do Dostoyevsky. 2) Daily Mail. An above average chance of senility means something sour is left on the tongue. Probably xenophobic and definitely stupid, these qualities do not help any eater savour the experience. 1) Jeffrey Archer. Even thinking of the empty heads that adore his painted by numbers stories makes me feel nauseas. As tasteless as boiled tripe. Digital searching Use Twitter to find prey, become a 'twitterer'. All the horror zines are on there, as are the writers. True, you will be inundated with 'five star' reviews but at least you can spot the lucky ones who think they are making it or who have an actual anthology launch. Keep a diary and note these, Google View the venues and ask yourself, What am I looking for in my killing zone? Make a checklist. Maybe, it will look something like mine, alleyway small park abandoned lot house of an elderly lady who no longer has a clue as to what's going on and thinks you are her cat If it helps, draw a map of the route from the place you will meet your prey to the point you will eat it. On your map, you may want to include, - small zombie icon, for you - small screaming human icon, for them - passing humans pretending to be on their mobiles - tripping point where the prey can fall over, so that you can nearly catch them, but not quite - dead end Use the map to pre-create the chase. Know their escape points and cut them off. At the anthology launch, there will be a tang of cheap wine on your tongue but you will not notice. Fortunately, zombies cannot taste anything except recently ripped flesh. The brightest colour we see is blood. Neither do we hear begging screams, only the rip of muscle from bone. But it is important to pretend to listen as the writers read out their stories. Visualise your non-verbal communication. Use a mirror whenever possible. Cock your head slightly, smile in a whimsical yet comprehending way, practise the odd indulgent nod or impressed head shake and try to ride the motions of the crowd, seeking the mood as a surfer would the swell. Rehearse interest and remember, if you have followed the rules of section three (Social Contact) you will not need to approach them. After the reading they will come to you. If you are lucky, the on-show talent will approach you. The more eager the hunted, the easier the hunt, and there is none as desperate as a debut writer. If you have followed this manual, you will be ready for your prey and able to step out the door with Mr Writer who really will believe that you loved his original and creative idea. Pout and laugh but without opening your mouth wide enough for your teeth to roll out. The grin will have to be through a closed mouth but the zombie who has followed this manual will not care. He or she will be self-actualised. All he or she will have to do is eat the writer. Congratulations on reading the manual and finishing the course.

{"text": "Amy and the Bear Amy is a little girl who owns a magical teddy bear. When she cuddles it, she escapes from an abusive home into a fantasy world where her name is Aimee, her teddy is a real bear, and her mother is the Witch. Amy wants to take her little brother, Aidan, to this sanctuary, and poisons him into a coma so he can cuddle the teddy bear, and stay there, forever. But the Witch kidnaps the little boy, and Amy must risk an entire world in order to save him. Part 1 Chapter 1 IN WHICH WE ARE INTRODUCED TO BARNABY THE BEAR AND AIMEE, AND THE STORY BEGINS. Amy turned the page of the photo album, her small, cold fingers rigid as its paperclips. She couldn't let the page go. A teddy bear named Barney sat on her lap, and leant against her chest. The pictures in the photo album were of Amy; enough to keep Granny happy. There were more blank spaces (empty, thin flaps of plastic like the cast-offs of blisters) than filled slips. In this photo, she was wearing frills; a white, lace, Christening dress. Amy often stared at it, her fingers prodding the sepia contours that mapped out the whites and beiges as though she could alter its details. Her cousin, Tommy, had a hologram of Alan Shearer, in his England strip, and, when it was turned, Shearer kicked the ball. You couldn't tell Amy that photos, especially sepia photos, weren't for changing. She was a wilful bairn, her Mam said. Amy cuddled the teddy bear. Looking at the photo, her memory made her think of the song 'Yesterday' - she couldn't remember the words but she could hum the tune. In the same way, her memories teetered on the tip of her brain, ready to speak secrets into her inner ear. Like any child, Amy liked secrets, but only when they weren't hers. Amy turned the page, but didn't let it go. The first image in the album was not a photo but a newspaper cutting, paperclipped to a brown edge. 'A CHILD WAS BORN,' it said, over-bold for the short column it headed. The picture was captioned; 'Aimee was born on Xmas Day!' Mam said it was her face, but not her name. Mam said; 'bloody, stupid journo's, couldn't even get the right, bloody spelling'. Amy wasn't sure. The face was different to the one she saw in the mirror; the black and white features had the look of a wooden mask pulled over a hole, with a scream that had gone digging for its tonsils, and fat, frozen cheeks. The face didn't look real but more as she imagined a golem would look, or a changling. But Amy liked the name. 'Aimee,' she said; making it last; tasting it. She tried it, as she would try the different flavours of Fruit Pastels; rolling it around her tongue and teeth. 'Ay-muh-eh,' she would say. Or, 'Ah-muh-ee.' She liked it best as, 'Ay-m-ay'. Though she didn't know the term 'symmetry', at this stage of her maths education, she knew it when she saw it (or heard it, in this case) and it pleased her. Amy glanced up at the window above her, distracted by a car, the wind, a knock, her fear. She was unsure which. She waited but there was nothing. Amy peered down and re-turned the page, back to her pre-Christening photo, taken when she was ruffed and disfigured by silk. In the picture, her body took the outline of a used candle. There was still a light in her baby-eyes, when she gazed at her mother. The baby Amy sat on her Mam's lap, but Mam was looking away, to the window. Her mother was sitting in the green chair they used to have, by the window in the lounge. In the photo, the chair was beige. Her Mam was bored, Amy could tell. She was turned away from Amy in all of the album's pictures, lips pursed like a Scotsman's wallet, or so Uncle Chris said. The little girl's heart narrowed every time she stared at her. 'Mam,' Amy whispered. She took the teddy bear's paw and it gave her a pull so small it may not have happened at all. 'Mam,' she said, louder. There was a rush of air that had the sound of a sneeze; but backward. She was falling into the photo. 'Mam,' she said, in the photograph, from behind the green chair that used to stand by the window, in the lounge. Now, it was green. The picture wasn't unmoving, anymore; not from the inside of it. The Mam in the photo looked down. From around the upholstery, she looked younger ' and paler - than the mother Amy knew. Behind the younger mother (to their left) stood a large, brown bear. 'Smile at me, please Mam,' said the little girl, 'Tell me you think I'm pretty.' 'What?' said the mother in the picture. 'Who the fuck are you?' In this Place, and Places like it, she wasn't called Amy; her name was Aimee. Aimee didn't tell her mother this. Instead, she said, 'Mam; tell me you think I'm pretty.' The bear made a face - a growl without a sound. It shushed Aimee with its longest claw, holding it before its snout, and backed away, shuffling behind the curtains, which were now paisley and daises. The bear pulled the thin fabric across as much of its body as it was able: a leg, an arm, a paw. 'Who the fuck are you? What are you doing in my home?' repeated her younger Mam, to Aimee. The baby in her mother's lap began to cry. There was something listless to the posture of its head, like a lollipop that had been dropped down the side of a sofa. 'Tell me you think I'm beautiful,' Aimee said, unheard beneath the wailing of her younger self. The curtain caught on the bear's claws and", "label": 1}
{"text": "eyes narrowing. 'I can't look. It hurts.' The two gargoyles sat on spikes at the apex of the school gates. The bars of the entrance were thin, blue and curved wickedly- at least as far as their anal passages were concerned. 'I know exactly what you mean,' said the first. 'I wish I was a grotesque.' 'Mmmm, hmmm, what's she doing?' 'Waving, I think.' 'Pretty, little thing' It's the one with the bear.' The gargoyle raised a claw and waved five talons in return. 'What a bonny dress she's wearing,' it said. 'I wouldn't look so happy, she's opening the gates.' 'Little bitch,' said the gargoyle, before yowling in pain as the blue metal bars swung outward. His bottom leaked red lava. 'That hurts like buggery.' The other gargoyle wasn't listening. It scrabbled at its buttocks with its slate-grey wings, and tried to hide the blood. 'I hate school,' it growled. 'I hate children,' said the second. 'Mr Him,' said Barnaby, extending its paw. Mr Him shook hands as one would shake the face of a snake. 'Good day?' said Barnaby. By this, Aimee knew, he meant; did you have a good day? Bears and men always talked the same way, in their own company, as though a word was better than a sentence, and a grunt best of all. Mr Him nodded and grunted, 'Uh-huh.' His chest was pressed out against his lemon coloured shirt. His hands, however, skirmished with a tissue in his pocket, and he chewed the whiskers around his thin, damp lips. His single, long hair, on the top of his head, appeared to be crawling away from the bear, or looking for an ear behind which to hide. 'You?' he said. Barnaby looked down and to the right, his paws opening and closing as though on a fresh corpse. Aimee wondered what he had been up to. 'Yep, field trip?' 'Ah, yes,' Mr Him smoothed the moustache that lay on his top lip, which quickly became wet as a tramp on a rainy, November bench. He slipped comfortably into teacher. 'Well, yes, we will be taking the class on a field trip into the Latter Wood,' he said. 'Completely safe, of course ' it will take place in the middle of the night, and should give the children ample opportunity to develop their oligochaetological skills' ah, I mean' the study of invertebrates...' Mr Him's eyes flicked between the bear and the air off its right shoulder. 'Lots of opportunities to develop,' he said, '' the chance to experience'' he added, 'I'm sorry, one of my children is trying to lick the hamster's head, excuse me, Mr Pooh.' He swished past the bear, with the sound of soft linen and loose hair. Barnaby's eyes narrowed. 'I'm not'' he said. 'Time to go,' Aimee said. 'Do all bears look the same to you humans, girl?' 'No. It's time to go,' said Aimee. 'Give me a hug,' said the bear. 'Arggghhh,' said Aimee, part of which was muffled by the bear's pelt, as he leant in. 'Go,' she managed, as he rose. He smiled in a way that made Aimee think of trolls under bridges. 'Bye, little girl, be good,' he said, and left. isH 'And, of course, I, uh, I still need to decide who gets to carry the lanterns and the buckets,' said Mr Him. Momentarily, the lantern he carried flickered, and Mr Him disappeared from Class 7. He often seemed to wish he could. The light then threw itself back out, yellow over the sallow pods of the Laburnum trees, and Aimee could see the class again. Mr Him was wearing the kind of smile only adult's owned, and put on like a spy's facial hair. Tower, who stood directly before it, tremoured. Tower raised his hand. 'Please sir, me sir,' he said. 'What?' said Mr Him. Behind his thick round-rimmed glasses, his eyes made Aimee think of horror movies. Psycho, perhaps. The face around them was wooden as it had been around Norman's, and carved into an expression of patience. 'Lantern, sir?' said Tower. Tower, of course, was his nickname. Like most of the nick-naming in This Place, Aimee was unsure how it was applied. The only tower Tower resembled was a minaret of soup. Despite his angularity, he seemed always to be wobbling, and about to fall. 'No. No. No,' said Mr Him, possibly stuttering, as he often did, or disagreeing vehemently, which he did whenever Aimee answered a question. 'Bucket?' 'No!' Mr Him's finger rose to the grey whiskers around his mouth, modulating them. 'No, Tower.' 'When are we going to see the nymphs?' asked a child. He hadn't put his hand up and Mr Him ignored him. Mr Him often said, 'With these children consistency is the key, and inconsistency the burglar. Especially with these chidren.' He often said this infront of class 7. Angel's hand went up. 'Angel?' 'When are we going to see the nymphs?' Angel said. In the dark, children could be heard sniggering. It was a mixed age group, and some of the class were ten and eleven. Sometimes, they talked about kissing each other, but Aimee ignored this. She was too young to have any interest in kissing, or in boys. 'We are not, as you well know, in the wood to chase nymphs, no matter what your burgeoning hormones are telling you Angel, we are here to talk to insects.' Angel didn't reply, but somehow made a sighing sound with the rolling of his eyes. Angel was a boy and as far from an angel as Aimee could reckon, from her readings of the bible. Except, of course, a fallen one. Aimee put her hand up. 'Aimee,' said Mr Him, after a pause. 'Are we going to talk to butterflies?' she asked. As with many girls of her age, she was obsessed with butterfles. And flowers. And love hearts. 'No,' said Mr Him. 'We are going to talk to worms.' Aimee couldn't decide if he", "label": 1}
{"text": "was being saracastic, and smiled, in case he was making a joke. 'Right,' said Mr Him, 'the buckets go to Earnest, Sunshine and Peter. Well done for standing so well. The lanterns go to whoever can listen best to these instructions. Now,' said Mr Him, who was as ever stammering. Aimee found it helped to faze out the repetitions, which she could achieve with ease. Otherwise, she got bored and, when bored, told off. 'Worms come out when it's raining. All of you have buckets with water in them. Dribble these on the forest floor, and, when the worms come up, ask them the questions we wrote down in class. Please apologize to the worms for disturbing them. We are representing the Night School, remember.' 'But they're only worms,' said Angel, more to Peter than to Mr Him. 'Many say the same about children. Especially in the staff room,' said Mr Him. 'Watch me, though, when I put my hair up,' he demonstrated this by running fingers through his remaining follicle. It stood to attention. Mr Him didn't need to lick his fingers o achieve this. His skin moisturised itself. 'You are all to come back when you see this. Okay, children.' He paused. 'Off you go,' he said. Aimee shifted as, around her, children looked at each and nodded and ran together like socially aware iron filings. Eventually, Aimee was added to a group of three boys ' Angel, Peter and Tower. They didn't look pleased to be with her, despite her smiling at them, and Tower looked scared. He was gripping the lantern, the light of which fluttered. Peter held the bucket Angel had pressed on him. Angel was holding out his hand. 'Welcome to our group,' he said, to Aimee. She shook it, as her uncles had taught her, and, looking down, found herself holding a long line of snot. The boys laughed together and scampered behind a rise of trees. As they showered her with moss (and shouted 'the Witch is coming'), Aimee followed. She crested the silhouette of earth to where the lantern light flapped like a moth's wings. There, she saw Angel had placed the bucket, upturned, on Tower's head. Tower appeared to be crying, though, with all the spilt liquid, it was difficult to tell. 'We need that,' said Peter. 'Cry baby,' said Angel. 'We don't need that. Look.' He began to unbutton his pants. 'You can't do that,' said Peter. He looked at Aimee. 'Not infront of a girl.' Angel shrugged, the action freeing his top button. 'She's seen it all before. Why do you think she comes to this school?' Peter had no reply and Tower was saying nothing, bar what sounded like a soft mewling. Angel urinated with some vigour on the wood's floor. 'It's pissing down,' he shouted. Aimee glanced at Tower. The bucket, on his head, was a helmet. It hid his eyes. 'Here, here, little wormy,' said Angel. 'You're the little bloody wormy,' said Aimee. She didn't know why she said this. She did know she felt angry, and was staring at his penis. Abruptly, with a splutter of indignant shock, he ceased urinating. 'Shut up,' he said. 'Little worm,' she said. She kept staring. She had never seen a penis before. 'Shut up,' he said. 'What'' said a small, ascerbic voice. A pink, curling finger of insect writhed up in the puddle of mud, '' kind of bloody rain is this?' The worm made a hacking sound. 'Oh My Witch, that is vile,' it said. 'Little worm,' said Aimee, again. 'Yes?' said the worm. 'Who are you?' He looked first to the girl, then to Angel. 'Why are your pants around your ankles? What is that smell?' 'Shut up,' said Angel, to Aimee. 'What?' said the worm. 'How dare you, impertinent youth! If you knew how many offspring I have produced. How many times I have divided. Do you know division, young man, or are you still on one add one?' 'You're just a dirty, little worm,' said Angel, who didn't take kindly to be talked to in this way, and especially with words he didn't understand. 'Oh, when you die, please don't be cremated,' said the worm. 'I would so like to eat your tongue. I do doubt you can.' 'Eat my tongue. Why would I do that? You eat poo, and I'm going to stamp on you.' Angel pulled up his trousers and his underwear and rocked backward and forward, from heels to toes. He raised his fists, though Aimee was unsure why. Peter, meanwhile, was backing away. 'Uh, Angel, I think we should'' 'I'm going to stamp you to itty bitty pieces.' 'I'm going to eat your ears,' said the worm. 'You mark my words. You won't be able to, when you're dead, partly because I'm going to eat your ears. Where's your teacher?' the worm added, as an afterthought. 'Teacher has put his hair up,' said Tower. Aimee didn't know how he could tell, with a bucket over his eyes, and through a line of Laburnum trees, and a hillock of dirt. She didn't move, watching the boy and the worm, circling each other. Peter and Tower were running, their feet heavy and fast as the sound Angel's urine had made, on the earth. Tower ran into a tree, rebounded, and continued away along the ridge-line. Angel looked up, blinking in the abrupt lack of light. He sprinted up the hillock in a spurt. Before the lantern's light died away, over the ridge, Aimee raised her right hand, and the tattered oblong of paper within it. 'How do worms multiply by dividing?' She read her own, slightly underdeveloped, script. 'Mr Him says I'm wrong when I do this.' Amy stared at the photo of her younger brother, closed her eyes and remembered when it was she had decided to poison him. It wasn't the first time she saw her mother cuddle Aidan.

{"text": "forehead as she kissed him goodnight, or let him breast feed until he was four. No. It was the moment of the accident. Clear as a summer sky by the coast, she saw her little brother, as she often did from behind her eyelids, with his cheeks plumped by Retriever-puppy fat, his shaven head glittering golden under the sun, his Geordie shirt black and white as a barcode. (They hadn't been able to afford a name.) There was a reason for the sunshine; in her memory he had been playing in the garden, by the laburnum tree, and Amy was colouring in her colouring-pad and had not noticed him eating its pods, until he had started to choke. She may have been a 'stupid bairn' but Amy knew her books, having read them from the age of three and a quarter, and knew what Flora and Fauna had to say about the seeds of a laburnum. She had run to him, her temples pulsing. The summer heat was rising and shivering as though the garden were made of tarmac. Every step jarred. 'Spit it out, spit it out, it's poison,' she had shouted, but he already had, splattering the bough of the tree where it met the dirt. She could see his saliva looped around the yellow lumps, like dog paw prints on the bark. Amy opened her eyes and looked at the photograph of her brother. He was in the garden. In contrast, he didn't look real. The picture was blurred not so much by the motion of his body and his laughter; but by his happiness. His eyes, even greyed by a bad focus, had the bright blueness of a boy who had not seen life for what it was. Amy had. The album was thick with him' him' as was her mind. She flicked back through time, to a space in the book before he'd been born and the little girl began to turn from its front cover. It was best to start at the beginning, she thought, or so Granny said. = Latter, the yellow in her pocket weighed her down. Vegetative, its colour was as fecund, as thick, as the air in the deepest jungle, in stories about bears that wanted to be Man Cubs, and stroll into suburban areas. Amy found it difficult to breathe, fingering her pocket as her Mam put on foundation in the small, eliptical mirror on its stand on the workbench. Amy's fingers came away stained, like the times she had stolen her mother's cigarettes. 'Get a move on, pet,' said her Mam, distracted by her own reflection. It really was quite beautiful, and not only in her daughter's eyes. 'I want him fed before I go to work.' 'Yes, Mam,' Amy nodded and added milk. The egg went white where it had been yellow. Mam applied fake tan to her pallid forearms, neck and ankles. Her daughter drew out a fisful of laburnum pods, trying to watch her Mam without looking at her. The girl scattered them in the places where the milk was mixing with the egg. She whisked with a fork. The yellow only became more viscous. From her readings of Flora and Fauna, Amy added, mentally, 'poisonous'. She had a plan for Aidan. A smell of blackened toast rose. Amy didn't recognise it, staring at what she had done with eyes that did their best to encompass the frying pan. In the mirror, and on her face, red lipstick slipped onto the slight puppy fat of her Mam's upper chin. 'Jesus, girl, watch what yer bloody doing.' In a spurt of forearms, Amy grabbed the handle of the grill pan, drawing it out from under the branding of the grill. Luckily, only the edges of the white slices had curled, like fungus around the roots of a Laburnum Tree. Amy expertly trimmed them, buttered them, and scrapped them from brown to beige. 'Aidan,' she shouted. Her throat caught on his name, scarring it, weakening it, and he ignored her. Her Mam twisted around the alcove to the lounge, shoulders and head snaking out of sight. 'Get down here now,' said her Mam, more loudly. There was a scamper of feet and the wooden retort of steps. The girl put the bowl of scrambled egg on the table, between the knife and fork she had placed earlier. Aidan clamboured onto his cushion before them. 'I'll get you a drink,' she said, quietly, and his eyes caught hers. She looked away, but not before he had passed her a silent question. What's wrong with you? He knew his sister. She went to the fridge and poured Kwik Save's Coke into a glass decorated by fading butterflies. She put it on the table, to the side of the empty fruit bowl. Aidan was eating, his cheeks working around the meal, bunching, slowing. He spat with an 'eugh' onto the toast. Mam turned, her body following her neck in segments, her neck following her face as if scared of what it might say. 'What did you just do?' she asked. 'Don't like it,' said Aidan. 'Tastes funny.' 'Eat it,' said Mam. The command was repeated in her eyes, and again in her posture. Amy saw her hands tightening around the lipstick, as though it were one of the knives she threw at Uncle Chris. The steak ones. Aidan didn't see, or the taste in his mouth misled his lips. 'Tastes funny,' he said. The breath had left Amy's body. Her urine wanted to follow, by the feel of it. Mam walked to the table. 'Eat it.' 'No.' The lipstick dropped to the floor like a round from a rifle. By the time it had finished clattering and rolling, Amy's Mam was behind the boy, her fingers in his hair, the others in the egg. She rammed this at his small mouth. Though his lips twisted and curled into a point, she found gaps. 'Eat it,' the words were breaths. Aidan", "label": 1}

Amy's Mam hadn't, but her cousin's had, and the book was a hand me down, and so well-handled. Amy etched out Jennifer with a biro, and wrote Aimee. Holding her teddy bear Jennifer [crossed out] Aimee walked down the stairs. She had to find clues to where the Crocodile Monster was. Her teddy, Droopy [crossed out] Barney was scared and hid his head behind Jennifer's legs [all crossed] was ANGRY and wanted to eat the bloody monster's head IN ONE GULP, girl. The private detective was child-sized, had a grey wig, and a cloak that had seen brighter days, so, Amy supposed, the reader could imagine themselves underneath both. Amy pulled open her bedroom door. Its planes hissed on the thin carpet, loud and sharp as the voices in her head. She crept out onto the landing, careful not to break the twigs in the foliage on the carpet, or to steps on the creaks in the floorboards beneath it. Her mother could be heard singing Barry Manilow downstairs. 'Mandy'. Book in her left hand, bear in her right, Amy stood on the tips of her toes, and walked to the end of the landing. Aidan's door was open, as ever it was. He could sleep in the dark, but he couldn't get to sleep. The girl slid between the door and the jamb, both chipped by the passage of people, and yellowed by the cigarrette smoke of previous owners. Against his spiderman pillow cover, Aidan's head was a circle of grey, lit at its chin by orange where the streetlights peered through the papery curtains. One of his hands, tight and small and balled, gripped the top of his duvet, misshaping Peter Parker's skull beneath his disguise. Amy could hear the boy breathing. It sounded like a whisper; 'you, you, you'. She stopped, the skin of her arms blushing about her elbow joints, and down to her wrists, where she had wrapped them around Barney. What can I do? she found herself thinking. She couldn't let go of the bear. I can't, she thought, can't. Not Barnaby. She prised her arms apart. The bear felt reluctant at her chest, like a child on the first day of Day School. She unpeeled the end of the duvet, and Aidan's fingers, and burrowed Barney gracelessly in. The breathing of the little boy sighed and he lay his arms around the teddy. Biting her bottom lip, and her teeth below it, Amy trembled away, feeling like a leaf. An Autumnbral leaf, withered and bled of the green shoots of hope, and when it was supposed to be still be Spring. She returned the way she had come, back to her own bedroom, the book chill and waxy and dead in her spare hand. Her Mam and finished with Barry Manilow and was singing I Will Survive, the explicit version, and throwing things at Uncle Chris. Soon she would be going to bed. Possibly hers. Amy held 'Crocodile Mystery' still in her hand. It felt insubstantial, unweighty. Amy had torn out all the pages, and had eaten some of them, before spitting them onto her window ledge, mactated and bubbled by drool. Her eyes felt hollow and she wondered where her tears had gone. Her guts were as fisted as her hands. She had been staring at the outlines on the wallpaper for an hour, waiting for the monsters to come out and take her. They hadn't and she felt as worn out as Jennifer's [crossed out] Aimee's grey cloak. Amy rose and walked to the bedroom door and stepped out onto the landing. The lights of it hurt her scalp, shafts of yellowed white running nails through her hair and down to her eyes. Stumbling, no longer caring the damage she did to the greenery at her feet, she walked to Aidan's room. She hitched inside, accidentally ramming the door against the inbuilt, whitewashed cupboard behind its arc. Her Mam didn't hear. Too busy Surviving. Neither did Chris. Too busy surviving the knives. Amy reached down and grasped Barney head, lifting him out of Aidan's grasp by the ear. In his slumber, Aidan mumbled, a crack of a frown subsiding down his pale forehead. It had the look of thin ice. There was a dark stain on his cheeks that might have been shadows. My shadow, Amy realised, and quickly left, running to her room. Amy closed the door, and slid into the soft gloom of her linen. In the bed, the sheets made themselves a secret place. It might keep her safe, keep her whole. It might even keep her away. Beneath the grey of the sheet, the colours eeping into from the landing, and via her blinds, separated into crumbs of the rainbow. Amy gripped the head of her teddy bear. She held Barney close. She reached for his paw, but didn't take it, though she could hear the loaded click of lights turning off downstairs, the stumble of steps on the stairs. Mam was coming. The footsteps rose to the landing and Amy squeezed her eyes tight, but could not do the same with her hands on a teddy bear's paws. Not yet. The feet sawed on their edges across the carpet, and seesawed at her door, before turning away. There was a flutter of sounds,", "label": 1}
{"text": "the wing beats of skin on carpet, then her Mam - Amy could hear her - passed into Aidan's small room. She closed his door. It shut lightly, as though it had no idea of what it did. Silence, bar downstairs. Then, up the well of the landing came the sound of The Exorcist, of crucifixes stabbing in. Amy had watched this scene, with Uncle Chris, time and again. Er mam had turned off the lights, leavingt Cxhris on the dark. He had ignored her. uncle Chris, Amy knew from experimnce,. Could ignmore just about everything. Still, th3e silence on the second storey. No Amount of sipirts could make up for what they meant. Why did she close the door, thought Amy, trying tpretend sh edidn't know. Trying to forget knowledge. Itw as ;'t the first tine, and she was rather good at it, but was interrupted as Aidan's door slid open. Mam rushed across the landing, usin g allk of her feet, bum,bling into the banisters and then the through into the bathroom. Amy thought she heard her sob once, or halfsob, the sound cpauight on her teeth. She slammed the door, and, pressed against that wall, Barney slid downward. The pullchord of a light, the clap of a seat being raised and thrown against the wallpaper that was grey and dead roses. There was the sound of a momentary struggle, like that between a seraial killer and his conscience. Predictable in its outcome. Shorter evcey time. Then the moist sound Amy ofyten heard her bed. Liquid and on the toilet, this time, but not urination, slower than that. Amy couldn't close her eyes any more than she had but tried, as if she could fold her skull in on sitelf, and thoughts within. Shje couldn't take this anymore. Reaching out, she took Barney's paw. For the first time, she took when she didn't need to, and fell from this world. Aimee breathed and opened her eyes. Her hair had grown and rested in tresses on her shoudlers. Her pyjamas were no longer pink on her shoulders, but now, hung there instead, was an indigo dress. It was the colour of twilight when there was magic in the air. The colour of Yeats's poetry, in bee-filled glades. They were taught Yeats at Night School from the age of five. The older children read Plath, as a warning. There were no bees in this glade, though there were insects, and they were complaining; 'Please, you're sitting on my head.' And, 'Oh God! Somebody just went Pop! Was it Bob? Please tell me it wasn't Bob. Bob can you hear me?' Aimee wasn't listening, though she sat quietly. She didn't need to raise her finger to feel that her cheeks had taken on a round of puppy flesh. She didn't need a mirror to see that the hue of her hair had gone from dirt-brown to tawn. She didn't need to do anything. She was happy and she waited for the feeling to pass. The sound of the bear was at her shoulder, and his paw gently pressed her upper arm. 'You came early, Aimee.' She ignored this. 'Are you okay?' she said. She couldn't look at him, at his dirtied pelt. She could smell the after effects of the bin, on him. 'Don't worry about me. Let me worry about me. You should be going back, before she comes out of your brother's room and comes to yours. You need to be awake when she comes in. Sometimes, Aimee, it isn't as dangerous being here, as it is not being there.' 'Okay.' She sighed, softly, with the sound of a stone that didn't want to sink. 'Okay. I will, Barnaby. I will.' He nodded and hunkered down, wrapping his fur-hung arms around her body. She didn't like to go again, not from this glade. He cuddled her and, when she was ready, he took her by the hand, and squeezed. Sweat lined her chest and dampened her pyjama-top. As the top was all she had, and it did little by the way of covering her lower body, her high tide of shame moistened the connecting skin between her lower legs, beneath her knees, and the pressed flesh between her inner thighs. She was unable to reach out to Barney. She couldn't be There if her Mam came Here. She didn't dare squirm, or slough off the sweat against the duvet. She didn't want the linen to begin its monthly stink, and for Mam to have to change it more often than she did, and, besides which, she didn't dare move. The bear stared at her, eyes somehow visible in the darkness as rabbit holes down which she wished to flee. Nothing happened. Nothing came, and not her Mam who, some time later, could be heard leaving Aidan's room, walking past Amy's door, entering the bathroom, and dry retching into the toilet bowl. Amy was back before either world could waggle its eyelids, and sitting in her Night School classroom. The Night School was a new build built in the oldest of places. She had walked from the glade, through the gates, along the corridors, to her class room like a gallstone being passed. Compacted, hard yet falling apart, and bloodied from passing through the crap of it. Her Mam had grown tired of Aidan's bedroom. On the interactive whiteboard at the front of the Night School classroom was a timetable. Tonight, there was no assembly; the evening began instead, as it did on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, with Show and Tell. Mr Him had explained that this was to help the transition from home to school. A transition they understood was not easy, he had said, what with all the multi-dimensional travel. Aimee, like the rest of the class, had stared at him with eyes as boggled as his. A central plank of the Night School's curriculum was to treat the pupils, as much as possible, as adults, in order to", "label": 1}
{"text": "empower them. Aimee remembered Barnaby explaining to her, at Guardian Evening, that this didn't mean treating her like an adult in the way her Mam did. Over time, Aimee had learnt the Night School was as much to be trusted as Barnaby. To her, it was as safe, as solid, as the world in which it was hidden. 'Okay, Tower,' said Mr Him. When he spoke, his comb over lifted indistinctly, as though conducting his lips. 'You first.' Tower stared at the teacher. 'Well, Tower?' said Mr Him, smiling in what he seemed to believe was an encouraging way. Tower proffered a stick. It had lump of green on the end of it. He tried to speak and swallowed. His knees jittered as though of the belief that they were running. His tongue didn't look like it could. 'That's lovely, Tower, what is it?' The boy breathed. 'It's-s-s-s not s-s-stick,' he managed. 'Sorry, Tower, please speak up, the whole circle needs to hear you.' Sunshine leant forward. She had the face of a baby that had died and become an angel; pale and cerubic. 'He said it's not a fucking stick. The mad little twat,' she said. Mr Him stared at the girl. 'What are the school rules on swearing, Sunshine?' 'Don't say fuck, twat, shit, bugger, son-fucker'' 'Thank you, Sunshine,' said Mr Him who turned to look hopefully at Tower. The boy demonstrated his stick's use, using it to prospect his right nostril. He came out with nuggets of green. 'A snot stick,' he said. 'Ah, I see,' said Mr Him, 'very useful. Kind on the hands, I would suppose.' Brains, who sat opposite Aimee in the circle, crossed his eyes at her. He had teeth the same orientation as his eyes, but only when he did this. 'And what did you want to show us, Master Brains?' Brains struck himself on the temple, and, like marbles, his eyes corrected. He pushed a pack of cards out from under his crossed legs. 'Are they Top Trump cards, Master Brains? You know they are banned of course.' Brains twitched and rolled backward onto the carpet, clutching his throat. 'No,no,' he said, 'they're playing cards, playing cards'' 'Killing it,' said Sunshine. Mr Him ignored her, though a single length of hair cast itself toward the girl and seemed to give her the bird. Brains righted himself by slapping his left temple. 'My dad's playing cards. Look.' He held one up. It was the seven of hearts, and depecited a burqa-clad young lady with a young man. She was bent to his hip-level, and intent on the erect penis before her eye-slit. 'Thank you for bringing those in, Master Brains,' Mr Him said, swiping the cards. 'And Aimee,' the words fluttered out on a sigh. Aimee reached behind her and drew out a model. 'You're ' you're- you're'' Tower breathed, ''you're a ho,' he said. The heads of the circle turned to stare at him. 'Your home,' shouted Tower. Aimee nodded and Mr Him's hair lowered. 'This is my bedroom,' said Aimee, turning around the model and pointing at the rear, second storey. She lifted the roof off. It was made out of corroguated cardboard. She tiled the model, so that the other children could see. On a matchbox bed, there was the cutout of a paper girl, wearing a dress that had been inked in purple, and red shoes as big as her legs. 'That's me,' added Aimee, unnecessarily. 'Well, that's really well made, Miss,' he paused, as though forgetting something, or remembering it. 'Does the class recall our lesson on homes? On the power of homes?' 'No,' said Samantha. 'Was it the one ending in 'full stop'?' 'No, that was sentence construction, Brains. The lesson on homes was about how powerful they are. The one when I showed you The Wizard Of Oz?' Mr Him's voice took a hopeful turn upward. 'Was that the film with Alice in it? And the rabbit? Was the rabbit a wizard' in a green room?' asked Sunshine. The lenses of Mr Him's glasses misted. He suddenly scurried backward to the wall, writing on the board in chalk. He wrote: 'Air keeps the power of the things that has happened in it.' And, attached by a line; 'In This Place, magic is in the air, and you can use emotion to cast it,' with a squeak of chalk, he finished a final line; 'Like Dorothy squashing the witch,' This, he underlined several times. Then, he stared at them. 'No,' said Brains, 'don't remember it.' He shrugged. 'Ye-Ye-Ye-Ye-,' said Tower. 'No.' Mr Him slumped on the wall, squashing himself against it. All soft yellow and beige and moistened lips, he looked like a swatted moth. Eventually, he raised his head and said, 'Yes, brilliant. Look, Aimee; concentrate all of your hurt and all your anger on the house you made. If you put all of your anger there, you will see the power you have, in This Place, that you don't, in The Other.' 'What do you mean?' said Aimee. 'Just' try.' Aimee stared at the house, trying to feel angry. It was difficult, she never felt angry. She couldn't remember what it felt like. She slumped. 'Okay,' Mr Him climbed down. 'What makes you livid?' 'Live where?' said Sunshine. Mr Him ignored her. 'What your mother does to you?' Aimee stared at the model, then shrugged. 'That your Uncle Chris just ignores it?' He was leaning forward now and peering, as though at a specimen of a disease. His slight nostrils twitched. His lips drew back into his moustache. The model home stood in her hands, seemingly more solid than the paper and cardboard and pen it was made out of. 'That the teachers ignore what is wrong with you?' Mr Him's tone had taken a strange turn. He licked his lips. The girl in the purple dress, on her matchbook bed, appeared to be asleep. 'What's happening to your baby brother?' Several books fell", "label": 1}
{"text": "off the library shelving. Paper drifted into the air and danced up the wall beside Mr Him's desk. The windows rippled as though ponds with pebbles being dropped into them. Wind filled Aimee's ears, and she didn't hear it. The classroom reverberated as though it had been slapped. There was a CRACK. The circle stared at the house. It didn't seem to have moved. Aimee couldn't see. Her vision was covered in nameless shapes, like shadows on the wall at night, or what the mind made of them. The model appeared to be unblemished. 'OMG,' said Sunshine. The board on the classroom wall had a large fissure running through its centre, crossing out 'witch'. 'Stop! Stop,' shouted Mr Him, eyes shying as though waking from a dream. Aimee couldn't hear him. Her ears were filled with screaming, and it sounded like her voice. Unseen through the shade that had shaoled in her corneas, a light exploded above the Show and Tell circle. Sparks floated down like magical dust. Aimee leant forward and coughed, cupping her mouth as her Mam had trained her. She stared at the lump of blood on her palm. 'Children just don't understand'' It was Mr Him. He stood nearby. Aimee looked up and saw that he was smiling his adult's smile, but that the word he spoke poked through it, and were anything but smiling. '' There are consequences to every action.' 'Why can't I bring my baby here? Why can't I bring him with me?' said Aimee. 'Not here,' said Barnaby, meaning the argument, not her younger brother. Other guardians waited closeby, to pick up their pupils from the classrooms. It was early morning, and time for the children to go home and get out of bed. A giant plastic baby crouched behind a cluster of yellow tables, a Rainbow Bright flickered in and out of existence, tapping her right foot impatiently as she waited for Sunshine, glancing at the clock on the wall. The face had one hand, and read quarter to Get Up! Time was getting short, not to mention blunt. A dragon's throat filled the corridor to the hall, and other guardians pushed their way past his scales, muttering apologies. The dragon said, sporadically, 'sorry' sorry,' in reply, huffing out ashes that had been caught between his teeth (one of which that looked a sheep). The Christian (the Night School caretaker) could be seen wiping soot from the floor around his snout. Aimee's voice fell to a whisper. Her eyes were red around the edges of her irises, and veined as the classroom-board. 'She's going to touch him. I have to save him,' she said. Barnaby sighed. The smell of red meat emanated from his maw. 'I can only rescue one child at one time. The child has to hold my hand. You know that' I don't have any spare hands, Aimee.' The girl's shoulders sagged, disappearing into the ruff of her lilac dress. 'Don't worry about the board,' he said, thinking she felt guilty for her emotions. 'It will heal.' 'She's going to get him,' she whispered. 'She's going to get him.' The Night School staff often said that the Christian put the taking care into caretaker. Now the Guardians were gone, he fastidiously picked his way across the tiles, careful not to stand on the lines between each. Small dark cracks were ananthematic to him. Softly, he whistled hymns from 'Mission Praise'. He ritually recited number seven, beginning, 'All creatures of our God and King, Lift up your voice and with us sing:' Not because the lines bought him closer to God, but because he considered the number seven lucky. So was, as far as the Christian reckoned, nine, three, and one. He didn't really think any numbers were unlucky, but then he would have to think of unlucky numbers to regard them as so, and he refused to think about certain numbers at all. The Christian entered the disabled toilet on the way to the hall. 'The Christian', as a name, was a misnomer, and completely accurate. Accurate because he was a piously observant Christian. Inaccurate because he also worshipped false idols. He spotted a mosaic of a magpie on the wall to the Infant classrooms, and saluted it. He didn't only salute fake magpies, however, but also Sparrows, Finches, Swallows, and any other bird. Birds were sacred to the Christian because they flew in the air and because, in This Place, that was where the magic was. He carried salt in his pocket and threw it over his shoulder whenever he entered a new room. This didn't aid his cleaning of the disabled toilet. Neither did the sand. 'Dear God, Allah, Vishna'' The Christian continued for a few moments, before saying, 'this is a mess.' It was always the disabled toilet and it was always sand and when it wasn't sand it was blood. Children! he thought, with some vexation. How do they make such a mess? He also thought, I'd better clean this before the Headmistress sees it, but these words did not register consciously. Only the tension did. He began to scrub, using his bucket full of brushes and water, and was particularly careful to clean each tile three times, in an anti-clockwise direction. Chapter 3 IN WHICH OUR HEROINE MAKES SOME WIND, AND SMELLS A FART It was dusk in the Day World and the road on which Uncle Chris parked was the colour of chewed liquorice. It had been recently retarmaced and the double yellow lines had not yet been painted. The swish of the windscreen wipers died as Chris twisted the keys. 'Park there,' her Mam had said. 'I don't want to walk. Not in this.' Apart from this, Mam wasn't talking to Uncle Chris, not since she had dressed into her fourth outfit and he had said 'But I love your bum. I like being able to see it'. Amy was very used to cooking eggs (they were cheap to buy, especially", "label": 1}
{"text": "when they were stamped VALUE) and the sight of Chris talking, at these times, was the same as Amy trying not to crack a yoke. It wasn't easy, not with the Kwik-Save kind of egg. Uncle Chris stared at Amy's mother, re-ignited the car, and drove to where she had pointed. As they stopped, the car doors opened- Mam's first, then the back two and, when the family were already walking toward the tower block, Chris's. It was drizzling and Amy's forhead quickly filled with a sheen of wet. She drew a forearm across it and greased her fringe. At the end of her arms, she held her sketchpad, which was darkening in blobs. Her eyelids winced at the rain, but she smiled. She liked going to Granny's. Uncle Freddie would be there, and his friend Davey. Amy liked Davey. He was funny. She thought Mam liked him, too. She thought Chris knew. 'Hi Mam,' said Amy's Mam, after she had buzzed on the intercom. Someone had etched 'fat bitch' into Gran's number, but her mother always concealed it with her palm, as though Amy could not see it when she did. The first time, her Mam had called it 'disgusting, what kids get up to'. 'Come on up,' said Gran's voice, but weak and distant, as though Gran were speaking from inside a small metal box. From the speakers came a farting sound. 'Dear God, Freddie, put that away. You'll give your Mam a bloody heartattack. I've had enough of seeing yer arse, I can tell you that.' Amy's mother covered her mouth with her hand, as she had the 'fat bitch', and as she did when she laughed. There was the crunch of Uncle Chris approaching. 'Mam,' Aidan was pulling at their Mam's sleeve. 'Can we, Mam, can we?' Her eyes darkened, perhaps deciding what emotion to be, as the doors buzzed open. 'Oh, alright then,' she said. Aidan tried to steal between the rear of her legs and the lattice work of the reinforced glass, but Mam put what little bottom she had in the way, giggling. Laughing also, Amy went past her on the other side and ran to the lift. She hit the button which went red as the sketchpad cover, creased where it was held in her other hand. Above, the walls and floors rattled as the lift jerked and lowered. 'Noooo,' said Mam leaving the door as she rushed for the stairs. It shut in Chris's face. Only his foot - a stained white trainer - kept it open. Beyond the glass, he lipsinked a swearword. 'I'll beat you,' threatened Mam, taking the stairs two at a time. The lift door opened. 'Quick, quick,' said Amy to Aidan, pushing him. Inside it was like the world in which Buck Rodgers woke up. All silvered metal, and steel rubbed to a glassy finish. Aidan pressed the number 2. 'Noo,' shouted Amy, but she was laughing, and hit 3. 'It'll take longer, now.' 'Nooooo,' said Aidan. 'Nooooo,' despite the rounding of his blue eyes, he didn't seem to mean it. 'Com'on. She's going to beat us,' said Amy. The lift hummed and shifted in its housing and smelt of urine. It reached the second floor. It stopped. 'Nobody there,' said Amy, crossing her fingers. The door opened. A shrivelled woman, so white she seemed to bleach the colour from the corridor around her, had shut her front door, and turned toward them. 'Hold,' she said, as Amy jabbed 3. Amy knew the old lady wouldn't get there. 'Hold!' The doors closed. 'Yes,' said Amy. 'Yeeeees,' said Aidan. The lift resumed. 'Come on, come on, come on.' Amy looked at Aidan and giggled. The doors opened and they rushed out, hand in hand, and stopped. Their Mam stood at Gran's red, flat-door. The door itself could no longer be seen, because it was open. The lift doors closed and the place they had been rattled as it descended. Mam giggled and said, 'Hah,' and went in. Flushing, not from the exertion but from the sight of her mother's smile, Amy skipped down the corridor, leaving Aidan behind, and into the doorway. Mam had already pushed in, and Freddie lifted the little girl into the air, pushing her face into his moustache and wiping his upper lip backward and forward across hers. Amy squealed and giggled and he said. 'Oh, I see, is that all you have to say for yourself is it, little fart?' He always called her a fart, even though she hardly ever did, and everyone could smell his. 'Put the bairn down, for Christ's sake,' said Gran. 'Aye, mam, okay, okay. Always grumbling, you grumpy sod.' 'Well it's having to live with you, isn't it? You disgusting oaf.' Gran smiled at Amy, her mouth becoming as big as her eyes were, under the thick NHS lenses she wore. 'Got a hug in there for your Gran, as well, have you pet?' 'Yes Gran,' said Amy, and buried herself sideways into the width under her armpits. Her Gran smelt, as she always did, of must that had relaxed into the same comfortable, happy plateau as had her breasts. Behind her, she heard Freddie say, 'Oh, who's this? He's so big. Are you a boxer?' Aidan giggled. 'Oh, don't hurt me, Mr Big Man,' said Freddie. Amy could feel him cowering into her back, as Gran released her. 'Please, please. Don't hurt me or'' Freddie whisked out, toward the boy. He was a mamooth man, given to muscles about his arms, tattoes about his knuckles, and fat about his midriff. He lifted Aidan off his tiny, trainered feet. '' I'll have to cuddle you. Give your old Uncle a cuddle, Little Man.' Aidan always got Little Man. Amy made her way down the tight corridor that separted the red front door from the kitchen and lounge. Inbetween were the doors to the two bedrooms and the bathroom, and boxes of overspilling clothes, since Freddie had", "label": 1}
{"text": "moved out from His Debbie's. She wasn't his anymore, except in conversation. The door to the bathroom didn't shut properly, and Amy had to rest her right foor against it, when she peed. She didn't like to poo, here. The flatdoor was closing, when Chris opened it. 'Oh, sorry, mate, didn't know you were coming,' said Freddie. 'Aye,' Amy could hear the slight, linen hiss of Chris and her uncle shaking hands. She knew, from experience, that Freddie would tower over him, and Uncle Chris would crumble, and try not to show it. 'How you doing, like?' Chris' voice heightened. 'Can't complain, like, you?' 'Aye, the same.' There was no animostity between the two men, and no love lost. It was clear who Mam loved more, and the knowing of this hung around Uncle Chris like an unidentified smell. 'Mikey's here, like,' said Freddie. 'Great,' said Uncle Chris, who accidentally sounded sarcastic. 'Come and have a cuppa,' said Gran. She always called Uncle Chris a 'nice, young man' and, when he wasn't there, 'you could do worse'. The adults sat around the small, half-mooned table in the kitchen. When they ate Sunday roast it became a full, blue moon, stained in a shape like a crater by the wall, by old tea. Amy put her sketchpad on the kitchen surface, boiled the kettle, poured water over teabags, spooned sugar, and cautiously carried the cups to the table. 'Boo,' said Uncle Freddie, and a lip of tea slipped over its rim of china. 'Idiot,' said Gran. Amy smiled and put the cups on the table, fingers shaking. Mikey came in from watching TV in the lounge. Chris, the only adult not sitting, stiffened against the wall, and though he seemed slightly taller, faded a little into the paint. 'Hang on, hang on, little fart, I've got a present for you,' said Uncle Freddie. 'Oh, not this, like,' said Mikey, smiling. He was bald but had a smile that made Mam grin and shift tightly on her chair. She lowered her head, blew on her tea, and stared up at him. Uncle Chris looked at anywhere but them. There wasn't much room and his eyes seemed hemmed in. 'Aye, aye, where is it?' said Freddie, long brown fingers rooting in the cupboards. 'It's a very special present for a little fart. I hope it hasn't been stolen. It was worth so much.' 'Idiot,' said Gran, smiling. 'How are you Mikey?' said Mam. 'Fine, like. Looking for work. You know how it is.' 'Aye, this one's been doing it for a year,' she said, not looking at Chris. 'Alright, pal,' Mikey offered his hand to Christopher. 'Didnae see you there.' 'Here it is, thank goodness,' Freddie smiled at Amy. He brought down a jar. It was empty. 'Idiot,' said Gran, but she was laughing. 'Uncle Freddie!' said Amy. Her feet were twisting at the end of her legs. She could feel the creep of red across her face, hot as the spilt tea on her fingertips. 'No, no bairn.' Uncle Freddie unveiled his fingers infront of the empty jar. 'This holds a magical present. Magical because it is invisible. Aye, invisible. Nobody can see it, but it's there, and I can prove it.' Everyone was laughing, even Uncle Chris, though he was not looking at Freddie, and was still staring at the fields outside the kitchen window, and the motorway beyond them. 'I'll tell you what it is,' said Freddie, cheeks and lips and moustache all as straight and in their place as they could be, 'It's a genie, like. Aye, you heard me, little fart, it's a wishmaking genie. An' you don't have to rub the jar, no all you have to do is unscrew the lid and make a wish.' He pushed it into Amy's unwilling left palm. He snatched it back and her fingers clapped around the air where it had been. 'But, and here's the thing little fart, you have to wish before it gets away. It's made out of wind, you see? And you have to wish out loud, like.' Amy stared at him as he pushed the jar back into her grip. The room had quietened. 'Ready to wish, little fart?' His fingertips were around the lid. Amy nodded. She thought she might accidentally cry. 'Ready'' He unscrewed. '' steady' Wish!' The lid came off and Amy opened her mouth. 'I w'' she said and gagged and dropped the jar. Her cheeks writhed around her lips. Her nostrils drew back in an instinctive snarl. The kitchen exploded into laughter. 'A fart for little fart,' roared Freddie. He was gripping the back of Mam's chair as he laughed, as if to stop himself falling. 'A big, fat fart.' Gran's head was a curl of hair on the table. From beneath it and her laughter, Amy could hear 'Bloody idiot.' 'That's disgusting, man.' Mikey slapped Freddie's back. 'When did you lay that?' 'Just now, in the bedroom.' 'Sick, man.' 'That's my bloody brother,' Mam was wiping at the side of her eyes. 'Farting in a bloody jar. Go on, love, get a drink, you look like you need one.' Amy's eyes were weeping, perhaps from the stink. Her mother thrusted her toward the sink and, with shaking hands, she turned water into a glass. 'Go on,' said her Mam. 'Take that and your brother a drink. Adult time, now, pet. Go on.' 'He's infront of the telly,' said Mikey, recovering. 'I put some cartoons on for him.' 'Thanks,' said Mam, smiling at him. 'No problem, pet,' he said, smiling back. Amy filled two cups with squash, walked through to the lounge, and put one to the side of Aidan, who sat on the floor watching a mouse skinning a cat. 'There's more than one way to skin a cat,' the mouse said. Aidan stared at it, unmoving. Amy put down her drink on a short wooden table. Also on the table-top was a Russian Doll, like that in her", "label": 1}
{"text": "Mam's bedroom, but skinnier, as though the bigger one around it had gone for a snack. Like her Mam's, Amy didn't like its blank eyes or hungry-smile, and placed her drink as far away from it as she could, and went and got her sketchpad, which she had left by the front door. She returned to the lounge, sat on the chair, and opened it. It said, over the sketched Latter Wood (the top of which was coloured in, anaemically, in white crayon), 'The Witch is Beautiful and has been Asleep for many years. Only one she loves can wake her.'. Ignoring this, Amy began to colour in the opposite corner of the Latter Wood, in yellow. 'This is your breaktime you're wasting,' said Mr Hymn. He was going red, as he did whenever he shouted. Mrs Skinner stood at the back of the class, washing paintpots with the kind of clunking, satisfied sound that suggested she was smiling at the wall. 'This is your breaktime you're wasting,' said Tommy. 'Right, detention for you, Tommy. Anyone else want to join him?' Adam looked as if he might say, 'not me,' but Mr Hymn's eyes did their best to grow until they had swallowed his glasses, and Adam didn't. Mr Hymn was losing more hair each night, unveiling a scalp that had begun to resemble a stop sign, with a series of hairs as its horizontal bar. The follicules were already going white. The line stood quietly. The pallets in the sink clunked against the water-pots and Mrs Skinner began to hum to herself. 'Right,' said Mr Hymn, not for the first time. 'Out you go, and no running.' The corridor to class 7 ran alongside its wall, which sounded thin enough to be made out of the laminated displays that papered it, and Amy, who stood near the back of the line, could hear the pitter-patter of tiny, sprinting feet, as they passed by. She also heard Mr Hymn as he walked to the pile of dark-green books on his desk. 'Where's my pen? Why do pens always go missing?' His voice was breathless, the syllables of a man who had been strangled for some time. Amy passed out of hearing him as she left the classroom and entered the corridor. She skipped, somewhere in the world of the passageway and the Junior Playground at the end of it, and somewhat outside both. As ever, her mind bridged the divide between This Place and The Other and, if adults said she was in the land of nod, they were always at least half right. It took some time for the little girl to notice that Catherine, her classmate, was speaking to her. '' do you want to play with us?' Catherine repeated. Amy considered the question and the pig-tailed brunette as if it were a question and a pig asking it. She didn't play with anybody at breaktime, or lunchtime for that matter, and hadn't been asked before. 'Yes,' she said, after a moment. During that moment, she had looked down at a quartered square painted on the ground, each quarter numbered one, through to four, and then up at the sky, which was cloudy. She hadn't looked around her, at the gathering group of girls, each clinging to the arm of another (and giggling) until they sutrrounded her. Attached to more gigglers than any other girl was blonde-haired Lucy. 'Do you want to play the game? It's called tig,' said Lucy. 'Spit-tig.' 'What's spit-tig?' said Amy. 'Weeell, it's like tig, but you make the person 'it' by spitting on them,' Lucy's diction was as flawless as her hair, which managed to catch the sun, and glimmer, though it was now beginning to rain. 'Do you want us to show you?' Amy shrugged. 'Yes,' she said. Used to being alone, she felt confused by the number of children, and her brain was having a hard job keeping an eye on them all, as well as listening to Lucy. 'It's like this' Catherine' show her.' Catherine's jowls, already widened by the passing of a large amount of Walkers Crisps, Coca Cola and McDonalds, wiggled as she hawked, then spat a line of gunge. It laced out like spaghetti ' hanging between her lips and Amy's stockings - but see-through, and not entirely yellow. 'You see - you're it,' said Lucy. 'Probably the best bath you've had in weeks, isn't it?' The crowd of girls laughed and a red blush, shiny as Mr Hymn's scalp, spread up from Amy's legs, to her face. Another girl (she couldn't see who, not because she was behind Amy, but because Amy's vision was wavering with heat and compressed rage) spat on her neck. 'Dirty girl,' the girl said. 'Get her clean.' The rest of the crowd began to spit, bar Lucy - who had wandered away, smiling. Ms Lydia, the teacher on duty, caught Amy five minutes later, crimson faced and punching Catherine in the cheek until her jowls vibrated on their own. Amy spent her next break in the foyer outside the Headmistress's room. She stood alone, having not told Ms Lydia about spit-tig. Amy didn't like to talk to adults. The glade appeared to be as wide as it was tall, which was to say infinite, going straight up, until it met the Witch's moon, and straight-sideways to the silhouttted horizon, where it touched the same. The long grass that stretched about them was a sickly sort of green. 'Some of you, in This Place, will be able to do magic,' said Mr Him. There was no breeze and his hair was lulled. As were, by the looks of them; his class. 'But you are not magical. Peter, stop doing that please. You are not magical, it is this world that is magical. You are simply riding on its magical coat-tails.' Mr Him exhibited the hem of his jacket and smiled a smile that approximated sincerity. 'You have no power of your own,", "label": 1}
{"text": "ripped. Her Mam turned, unseating the baby, who slid against the arm of the chair. 'Oh my God,' said her Mam, biting her lips into a curl. Their tight circle shook and unravelled. 'Uh' hello,' said the large, brown bear. It extended a paw, as if to shake the woman's hand, then seemed to think better of the action, and withdrew it. Her mother ignored the baby as it tried to right itself. 'Oh my God,' said her Mam, again. This was too much. Aimee stood and walked to the bear, taking his uncovered paw and coming back out of the photograph. Returned to stillness, her mother was no longer looking out of the window, but at the curtains. Her young, pretty, dark face was turned away from the lens. Half a bear was visible in the background, failing to hide behind a daisy on a curtain. Amy blanched and shut the album. She would have to return and change the photograph back, before Granny came round. Once upon a time, I was an average, old teddy bear. I owned a little boy with blonde hair and green eyes as big as my world. When he laughed, his dimples went deep into me. He would cuddle me, in secret, and I would cuddle him back. There was nothing he couldn't survive, with me by his side. I'm an old, battered, beige bear, and the adults didn't suspect me. One day, they took him away, to the room next to ours. I couldn't reach out to him. I was only a teddy bear, then, and had to listen as he screamed out my name. This time, they went too far to hide it from the teachers, from the social services, from the police. On that day, I stopped being a teddy bear and became a real bear. Amy blew out the match with a tight, worried mouth. Below the smoking splint, the blue fire looped over the congealed hob like Mr Him's greasy comb-over. Seven of the seventeen flames were missing; Amy had counted them, and the fire tended sideways. Amy eclipsed it with the full round face of the frying-pan, mooning the metal with an egg. She cracked in one more. Her Mam watched her from behind a cigarette, and from infront of the fridge. The fridge hummed at her back, to the tune of 'Yesterday', Amy thought. She had learnt it in music class, in her Day School. 'Too hot,' her Mam said. 'Yes, Mam,' Amy said. Amy didn't mind when her mother watched her; because when Mam was watching her, she wasn't watching him. Amy turned the knob. Ten flames became seven. Her mother looked pale, bleeding into her background. She was on her time of the month and, at these times, seemed to fade from this world and into another. Amy knew how that felt. The button beside the cooker was red - its 'on' lit - and the grill was turning the same colour. Amy slid the bread in. The yokes were bubbling, but were still flat. They looked, to Amy's eyes, like her mother's breasts. The plastic cups of their packaging had 'value' printed on them. 'Nearly done, Mam,' Amy said. 'Suppose I'd better get ready, eh, pet?' Her mother sucked the cigarette then stubbed it out, fingers curled as her lips had been. The cigarette sighed. 'Yes, Mam,' said Amy. Barney's scalp smelt of other children's tears. Amy held the teddy bear about his abdomen. His pelt was coarse against her cheek - rough as the carpet at her bare feet. Both had the texture of the skin at the end of her nose. She cried onto Barney in dribbles. Amy's knees were covered by the green outgrowth of an ill-fitting, corduroy dress. The smell of Barney's previous owners spiked her nostrils, skewering through the mucus only when she sobbed. 'Eat this shit, eat this shit,' whispered Amy, into the teddy's ear. Her lips traced out imprints of gunge. 'If you think I can eat this shit, you eat it. Go on, eat it. I'm supposed to go to work on this? You can't even cook fucking eggs.' Amy burrowed her head into Barney's. Downstairs, in the kitchen, her mother had made a burrow of the fried eggs and forced Amy's nose down the hole until it met toast. Now, as she cuddled her teddy bear, egg smeared over Barney's pelt, leaving occasional pale scales on Amy's cheeks. Yellow yoke and the white clung to her teeth, as if she'd been force-fed daises. At her crossed knees, a Winnie the Pooh book lay open, pinned to the carpet by her right palm. The skin of Amy's olive arm looked like the bark of a root, gnarled and dirty. Her dress, where it hung short-sleeved against the skin, had the bunched, unregarded look of moss in the shade. Playing with the faeries, thought Amy, for no reason other than it had been drummed into her. Her fingers were in the Hundred Aker Wood. Tears fell on Eeyore's field, flooding it. 'Typical,' said Eeyore, in her mind. Over the years, Amy's brain had become a very real place to be. The tears slowed until they seemed to move back and up. If she could have seen it, there was a look of determination in the withdrawal of her chin, in the dwindling gaps between her teeth. She hugged Barney tight, snuggling her cheek against his. They would travel together. She could smell the other worlds, again. They would travel together. Amy closed her eyes. There was no more moisture to squeeze out, only everything that she could see: the white of her Argos cupboard, the Take That posters, the books on flora and fauna, the blue, wallpapered wall. 'Barnaby, Barnaby, take me away,' she whispered, calling her bear by his real name. She took him by the paw and he seemed to pull, in return. The action was so slight, so unlikely, that, by the odds", "label": 1}
{"text": "children, but the environment does, and you can capture this.' In between the hatchings of the long grass, visble here and there, were tents. The class had spent the early hours of the night pitching camp, with class 8. This, class 8's teacher (Mrs Her) had told them, was a Field Trip. As such, they would be spending the night in a field. 'Quiet, Angel,' said Mrs Her. She told off children from Class 7 more often than children from class 8, even though they were normally talking to each other. Mrs Her looked pointedly at Mr Him. Mr Him continued speaking, seeming to make a point of ignoring her. 'There are spirits in the air,' he said. 'We have covered this in class. Try to remember, Tower. These spirits are called our most extreme emotions. Ectasy and joy' Why are you smiling Angel, can you tell the class what is so funny? No?... Rage and despair. And all these spirits are in the air, like the bellows of a tempest, or like puffs of wind. Bottom, Sunshine! Tonight, you will try to control these spirits. To excite them. In short, children, you won't be sleeping in these tents, you will be trying to blow them down! And, if you are really good, you will be trying to blow them up.' He pointed at the sky. The boys looked at each other with eyes momentarily brighter (and seemingly wider) than the Witch's Moon, and with gaping, black smiles. Mrs Her stepped infront of Mr Him. His brush-over, visible behind her head, appeared to bristle. 'Who here has seen the Wizard of Oz?' asked Mrs Her. There was a pause in which the wind grew and the canvas of the tents slapped at themselves like self-harmers. Aimee wondered if Mr Him was feeling anger. His face looked like it was. Tower put up his hand, which trembled, before falling back on his head. 'Well,' Mrs Her sighed as much as said, 'in the Wizard of Oz, Dorothy - the character Dorothy - had a house that was picked up by a tornado' Does anyone here know what a tornado is?' A hand. 'Yes?' 'It's a plane, miss.' 'Ah, well it is, Downbeat, yes. Maybe if I said Hurricane..?' The same hand. 'Yes?' 'It's an old plane, Mrs Her.' 'Quite the enthusiast aren't you, Downbeat?' said Mr Him. Downbeat smiled and nodded enthusiastically, as he often did. 'No, ah'' said Mrs Her. Mr Him interrupted, crabbing infront of her. 'What Mrs Her is trying to say,' he said (Mrs Her stared an avalanche of flint at him), 'is that when we are finished tonight, you will be able to pick tents off the ground with your minds' Whole tents clean off the ground.' A different hand. 'Yes, Peter?' 'We're going to clean the ground with tents?' 'Don't be obtuse, child,' said Mr Him. Peter frowned. Angel leaned across to him and, out of Mr Him's earshot, but within Aimee's, said, 'He called you fat. Obtuse means really, really fat.' Peter's frown deepened, canyoning his head in the dark. He was a slight child, and only nibbled his food at midnight-snack-break. 'Stop!' shouted Mrs Her, as several children rose. 'We haven't told you to go. Did we tell you to go, Sunshine? Why do you find it so hard to find your bottom? Sit Down! Now'' Mrs Her breathed and the wisps of her beard rose skyward which, now the Witch's Moon had risen utterly, was moonward. '' who can tell me why we are trying to pick up tents, instead of houses?' She paused, glaring at the two classes. Her eyes began to bulge, waxing in her face. 'Well?' she grasped her beard in frustration. Mrs Her, as far as Aimee could tell, was always pulling her hair out. The girl wondered how she had managed to accumulate a beard. 'Have you ever tried picking up a house? Well? Have you? Have you?' None of the children answered. Shaking, Mrs Her walked away. 'I give up,' she could be heard to say. Smiling as real a grin as Aimee had seen from him, Mr Him said, 'Well done for listening so well, children, do you have any questions before we start?' Angel's hand rose. 'Angel?' 'Are you and Mrs Her married?' Angel said. Mr Him shook his head. Nothing, though, was going to dislodge his grin. 'I've told you before, young man, our names are a coincidence.' Angel didn't reply. 'So' off you go, class seven and eight. Don't forget to think about things you hate,' he added, glancing at the back of Mrs Her. With a flick of his fingers, he gestured at the nearest tent. It rocketed moonward. Aimee made her way up the line to walk beside Mr Him, as the field trip returned, via the Latter Wood, to the Night School. She put her hand up, which he didn't seem to see, in the dark. After a while it began to ache, even though she had been lifting tents with her emotions, not her hands. 'Mr Him,' she said, eventually. 'I think there were children watching us from the side of the glade. I keep seeing children in the forest. Is the Latter Wood haunted?' As they were at the head of the line, and the lanterns were behind them, Aimee could not see the flinch in Mr Him's cheek, or the tightening of skin around his eye-sockets. If they were not already darkened, a shadow would have passed over his eyes. 'N-no,' he said, before adding. 'Put your hand up, Aimee. I can't pick you if you don't put your hand up.' 'But I did,' she said. Mr Him, though, did not appear to hear her, increasing his stride until her legs could not keep up. Having let go of Barnaby's paw, she stared up at the artexed ceiling. Even in the dark, it had the look of shark fins circling. It was still night. She lay", "label": 1}
{"text": "unmoving, perhaps hoping the predators wouldn't notice her. The duvet was drawn up to her chin, so they probably hadn't. Her legs were pressed together, and that sealed it - her body was untouched. Her heart caught in her throat and her breath found it difficult to bypass it and reach her lungs and her eyelids snapped open in panic. Adrenaline crinkled into her limbs, making them hard to move, when she needed to get up, to see her baby brother's door. At some point, and she didn't later remember when, her bare feet made the carpet. She became aware of its tight, grooved lines only as she left the bedroom and stepped onto the flattened, dejected texture of the landing-carpet. The door to her left - the bathroom - was closed. Inside, the light was on and there was the sound of urine falling, which did nothing to elide the sound of tears joining it. Her Mam was sobbing. Aidan's door was open. As unable to go on as she was to stop shaking her head, she couldn't enter her baby brother's room. She couldn't see the way his Spiderman duvet had been drawn back, the way his eyes squeezed shut while he pretended to sleep. Amy retreated. I'm too late to save him, she thought, and the words sounded like an adult whispering into her brain. When she had returned to bed, she could not bring herself to hold her teddy bear's hand, even though he looked scared. Amy had come to school alone, that day, without the flotsam that was her brother bobbing behind her. She was olive-skinned and wet-haired from grease. Mr Hymn wondered, in the evening as he drank his nightly red wine, if that was why it had happened. She was never the same, on the days when her brother was ill. There was a bond between them. Mr Andrew Hymn was, and had been since eighteen, a rattish looking man, having finished being a mouse of a boy, whose whiskery facial hair had failed to inform his scalp that he was hirsuite. He was prematurely balding. He wore thick rimmed, round glasses, as though in an attempt to capture his manic eyes, which always seemed to be looking for a way out. For a year, his first in teaching, Mr Hymn's brain had joined them, and had ceased remembering where he had come into this profession, or why. His Teaching Assisant, Mrs Joan Skinners, was his height. Her hair was short, and sprayed into a conformist helmet of tight, blonde curls. She had the air of a butch lesbian embittered by years of denial. She was married, went out with the girls every Friday night, and had a face that lit up only when she saw a baby. It did no such thing for seven-to-nine-year-olds, who formed the years which she taught. One of her favourite phrases was, 'I'll be doing no such thing'. Most of the time, in Mr Hymn's experience; she didn't. On the day Mr Hymn would later refer to as 'Worms In Their Pants Day', Mrs Skinner stood in the forest walk, taking the afternoon register. This ' registering outside, where they would take the lesson - had been her idea. Not that Mr Hymn didn't have plenty of ideas; he did, but they rarely acted on them. 'Amy,' said Mrs Skinner. The little girl did not reply, staring off to the side and into a bush, her face looking every inch the Special Educational Needs child she was. 'Amy,' said Mrs Skinner. 'Here,' said Amy. 'Here, Miss,' said the adult. The child stared back and the June air wove tight and curled as Mrs Skinner's hair. Blonde sunlight shone down, between the trees. 'Here Miss,' said Amy. Once Mrs Skinner had finished ticking off the register, she said, 'Over to you, Andy.' Mr Hymn flushed. He had imagined screaming at the teaching asssitant on many occasions, and on some of them for calling him by his forename infront of the children, but could never so much as raise his voice. It was often the same with the pupils. 'Andy Pandy?' said Adam. 'Adam, we've talked about this before,' said Mr Hymn, his enlarged eyes finding Mrs Skinner. 'Now,' he continued as much to stop Adam doing so, 'we are going on a Worm Hunt.' They were studying We're Going On Bear Hunt by Michael Rosen. 'Now worms don't like - Simon stop doing that - to come out when it's sunny. Michaela, are you listening? So, we're going to trick them.' It was nine in the morning and his cheeks were aching. His lips longed for a drink and he licked them and, accidentally, the moustache on top of them. 'We're going to trick the worms under you feet'' 'Urghh,' said Adam. Nathan giggled. Mr Hymn had taken an instant dislike to the two children, an instant that had lasted for several months. '' into thinking it's raining.' Mr Hymn's voice lowered to an elaborate whisper. 'But don't tell them. Because there's nothing worms like more than the rain, and we're going to trick them into thinking it's raining.' 'What did he say?' said Nathan, to Adam. 'I can't hear him.' Mr Hymn looked over to Mrs Skinner, who was smiling fondly at the boys. She liked, Andy knew from previous experience, boys who were trouble-makers, as long as they didn't cause her any trouble. 'Boys will be boys,' she would say, somehow manging to imply that primary school teaching was no job for a man. Andy had no idea how she managed this. 'You each have a bucket of water, and a trowel,' said Mr Hymn 'Why do we need a towel?' said Adam. 'Are we sunbathing?' 'Now, Adam,' said Mrs Skinner, smiling at the boy. 'So,' said Mr Hymn, pinching his palm to stop it slapping a seven year old, 'what you need to do is pour the water on the earth ' in drips '", "label": 1}
{"text": "on the ground, to pretend it's raining, and then dig out the worms that come up.' He smiled down at Lucy, a golden, perfect, dollish girl who always sat close to him. She smiled back. It helped to pitch all his lesssons at Lucy. She was the kind of good little girl that made teaching if not bearable; then easier. 'Okay, off you go children.' And they did. Mr Hymn was so busy refereeing the ensuing scrum, and chasing around after the boys, that he didn't watch what Amy did with the worms and the pockets of her skirt. Later, he would wish he had. The next lesson in the day was P.E. The boys changed in one corner of the classroom, the girls in the other. Mr Hymn sat, facing the boys, staring down their attempts to look at the girls, and steadfastly refusing to turn around, no matter what sounds came from the girl's side of the room. Halfway thrugh P.E, Amy asked to go to the toilet. As a good teaching practitioner, Mr Hymn later reflected on this moment and couldn't remember what he had said, in reply. No doubt, it was a hurried acquiescence. Mr Hymn was a very reflective teacher, according to his observations (of which there had been many). This didn't, though, seem to help him. The more he thought the more his thoughts turned to red wine, and to worse, in the night. When the class returned from P.E., the change back into uniform passed without incident. This should have been a bad sign, but Mr Hymn ignored it. P.E. was the last lesson of the day, and parents were pressed to the window of the classroom like zombies which would work out how to get in, and soon, when Lucy suddenly screamed. She rose into a crouch and started to pull down her navy-blue stockings. 'Lucy!' Mr Hymn might have screamed. Instead, he squeaked. The little girl was now pulling frantically at her underwear. A large, bulbous, pale worm hung from the front of her knickers. 'Lucy's got a willy,' said Adam. The class laughed as one entity, the ho ho ho of a giant. The sound boomed in the cavities of Mr Hymn's mind. The parents seemed closer, despite the door. Lucy pulled down her knickers, exposing herself. Mr Hymn put his hands over his eyes. On reflection, he could not believe he did this. As ever, on occasions when he needed her, Mrs Skninner was somewhere else, pretending to be photcopying. There was the wet sound of a clump of worms flopping on the floor. 'Lucy's got lots of willies,' said Nathan. Their laughter crawled across Mr Hymn's face. Lucy, no doubt, knew that kind of crawling. Oddly, Andy wanted to bury his face in dirt. It didn't take long for him to ascertain what had happened; that Amy had excavated worms then kept them, crawling, in her skirt pockets, before hiding them in the undergarments of Lucy. It took him considerably longer to talk his headmaster down from suspending him. On reflection, Mr Hymn was unsure why he had. Amy's body had trained itself for the walk home from her school as a marathon runner would - in stages. Steady paced on the roads named from F to B, her gait slowed as she reached the A's. She went through the wall when she approached her front door. As a runner would, she visualised the end of the course. She imagined the raised hand, the falling fist, the pain where she was stricken. It was hard not to visualise it. It had been in Mam's eyes, from the moment Mr Hymn had said, 'Can I have a word, please?'. Her mother held Amy's hand throughout the route, dragging Amy as the child's feet dragged. As it was, the house was quiet when they returned - haunted by a sickly silence - and her Mam left Amy at the porch and rushed upstairs to check on Aidan, her lips twisted as much as her fingers had been. Amy took of her school shoes and walked to the kitchen, across the lino, and unlocked the back door. She went into the garden, not because it was safer, but because the Laburnum Tree stood there, and because her skirt pockets had one more duty to fullfill, today. She was still gathering the seed-pods when her mother returned. Mam had brought her fists. Chapter 4 IN WHICH BARNABY THE BEAR LEADS AN EXPEDITION TO FIND SOME EAST POLES 'Eat it, or I'll tell Mam,' Amy's whisper curled into the air like her Mam's lips. Aidan glowered up at her from the settee. Infront of them was the BBC and children's programming. It was early in the evening and Mam ' after, she had said; all the bother with Amy - had taken to bed with a headache. 'Bits in it,' Aidan said, but he ate, the milk slipping down his chin as his mouth ground around the cereal. Though she was upstairs, their Mam was present in the creeping of her children's feet on the carpet, in the down-turned volume, in the threat in Amy's eyes. Aidan finished his bowl, swallowing the lumps of Frosties seasoned by Laburnum seeds. 'Hate it,' he said. 'I'll get you some coke,' she said. He nodded and stared at the T.V. He was getting paler. Before she left, Amy swayed on the blades of her feet. It wasn't the first time she had stared at him and worried. The other occasions, though, were when Mam was around. Thinking back, she did't remember her first ice-cream, her fifth Chritsmas, her first stolen smoke of her Mam's cigarettes. Her earliest memories were of Aidan being changed, and her watching as Mam's fingers efficiency pulled, wiped, tied. Watching the fingertips. Amy walked to the kitchen and to the fridge. It shuddered as the light came on, and she removed the red and white labelled Kwik Save Cola. Hands raised above", "label": 1}
{"text": "her shoulders, she approached the bench like a bishop with a sceptre. Tipping her abdomen (the bottle was close to full, and heavy) she poured, and filled a glass printed with faded butterflies. Returning to the lounge, she placed the coca cola at Aidan's side then walked to the clefts in the fake-tone fireplace on the left of the T.V. She withdrew the photo album she had deposited, several days before, and walked around the sofa, so that Aidan could not see her. It would be several hours before the adults rose. Mam would before Uncle Chris. Nonetheless, she slid the album into the dark, linted envelope of space below the sofa and went upstairs to get Barney. As she passed Aidan's bedroom-door, she couldn't look at it. 'Who's that puffing down the track?' said the T.V, as she returned downstairs. 'It's Thomas.' 'Turn it down,' Amy hissed and Aidan shrugged, reversing his tiny finger on the zapper, where he had been mili-metering the volume to the right. She lost sight of him as she sat on the carpet behind the sofa and withdrew the photo album. She could still hear him, if only his shifting. Cuddling Barney, she opened the album, held Barney's paw, and touched the photo taken before her Christening. 'Fuck,' said her mother. 'Fuck, fuck, fuck'' Aimee pointed at the window. 'Look, it's another bear,' she screamed. As her Mam turned back to the view of the street, she jumped past the chair, pulled up the daisy-printed curtain, and grasped Barnaby's paw, pulling him to her left. Amy stared at her handiwork. Her Mam's expression was no longer bored, but at least she faced the right way. And there wasn't a large, brown bear hiding behind the curtain. It wasn't perfect, but it would do. She turned the pages and years went by; one, two, three. Now, she came to pictures of Aidan as a baby and there was no longer the see-through blisters of plastic where photographs should be. Aidan crying. Aidan breast-feeding. Aidan in the garden. Aidan sleeping. Aidan lying down. In the background of most shots was Amy. 'Like his bloody shadow,' her Mam said when Granny was round. Later, Mam would make an effort to make sure the girl was the other side of the camera but, so focused on her younger brother was she, Amy could remember when these were taken, and where she had been standing. It was all about line of sight, or line of hearing, to the little boy. As the album reached its halfway mark, he was no longer a baby. Amy's finger dallied on Aidan dressed at Christmas, in a new spider costume, smiling out from between fangs of black felt. On his forehead, six white eyes goggled, the pupils finding their rims as if trying to escape. Her throat lumped and she regarded his face. How could she keep him safe? It wasn't a rhetorical question. Amy rose and walked around the settee to the T.V. She replaced the album in its niche, and turned. 'The fat controller wasn't happy about this,' the television said, as she turned it off. 'Awwwrrghhhhh,' said Aidan. Then, on seeing the teddy in her arms, he sunk into the corner of the cushions and shook his head. 'No,' he said. 'No.' She walked toward him and, by her knees, onto the sofa-cushions. Her pyjamas tugged her thighs. She was too strong for Aidan, and she bear-hugged him, forming monkey hands on the other side of her teddy, which was now pressed into his squirming stomach. 'No,' he repeated. Even now, he would not shout. Amy held the little boy until his head slumped back against her chin and his lungs emptied onto her right shoulder. 'Give me your hand, pet,' she said and took his fingers. She placed them on the teddy, and closed Aidan's grip. Simultaneuously, she grasped Barney's other paw and they travelled together, all three of them falling. 'So,' said Barnaby. His maw made a slight slapping sound as he talked, as if he were speaking around a portion of human thigh. 'We thought we would go on an Expedition, you know, seeing as this is only the third time you've visited This Place.' Barnaby paused. He was bent to his hunches and trying to face the five year old boy, which was hard, as Aidan had his face buried in Aimee's lilac dress. 'So' Does that sound exciting?' said Barnaby, slapping his way through the syllables. To Aimee, he sounded nervous, and often did, when speaking to toddlers. Barnaby's friends, the Christian and the Piglet stood near by. Piglet coughed and scratched his yellowed y-fronts. 'Where are we going'' said Aimee, to interrupt the silence. '' on the Expedition?' 'Ah,' said Barnaby, to Aidan; rather than Aimee. 'We thought we would try to find a Pole. And we thought about the North Pole, but the North is the land of the Witch, as you well know. So we decided we would find the South Pole.' He grunted as he rose to full height, his knee-joints clicking. Aimee stared up at him and blinked. With Mr Hymn's class, in the Day School, she had studied European Geography and, while she wasn't as good with maps as she was with plants or with stars, she distinctly remembered where the Poles were. 'There isn't a Pole in the South,' said Aimee. 'The Pole is in the East. It has its own land' And it isn't one Pole, there are lots of Poles in their land. So we would be looking for a Pole.' The Bear and the Christian and the Piglet looked at each other. Piglet shrugged, pulled his face down so that his lips made an 'n', lit a cigarette, filled the top of the letter, and shrugged again, inhaling. The Christian said, 'Well, she is a very clever girl... I don't really know... for sure.' 'We did it in school. Mr Hymn said so,' added Aimee.", "label": 1}
{"text": "'Well, if Mr Him said so,' said the Christian. 'And it would be easier, you know, if there were lots of Poles in the East, instead of just one, to find one. If you see what I mean.' Piglet grunted, perhaps because he agreed or perhaps because he was scratching his y-fronts, again. ('One,' repeated the Christian, to himself, apparently because he liked the number. He often said this, or three, or seven, or nine.) 'Okay, that's decided, then,' said Barnaby. The bear bent once more, with a grimace that showed his teeth. Aidan, who had mustered the courage to peek past the folds in his sister's lilac dress, buried himself in frills. He was wearing a robe the deep blue of the sky near its highest point. 'Well, what do you think of that, little human boy, we are going on a Pole hunt? Won't that be fun?' Barnaby had put on his toddler voice, again, forcing out a tone of placation. Unfortunately - alongside it - there issued a stench of human meat. Aidan shuddered. Aimee thought he might be crying. Turning away, the Bear added, in an undertone, 'He hates me.' They tracked East for several hours, winding some way South and some way North but taking care to skirt the frozen, icy realm of the Witch. They passed the perimeter of the Night School which, of course, was locked up, as it was Daytime, but the Christian showed Aidan, when he would peek out from Aimee's dress, where the spiders laired in the cavarns below the Night School's plateau. The caretaker spent some time locating all of the fetishes he had tied to the fence; re-tying them all. (At one point, Aimee thought she heard a gargoyle, high in the clear day, saying 'Oh God, it's children. I thought the school was closed. Oh, no! My bottom can't deal with any more children!') In the East beyond the Night School's plateau, the Latter Wood relaxed its botanical rules, and allowed birches, oaks, willows and beeches. Piglet's home was cloistered in the roots of one willow, which did appear to be weeping, but perhaps because of the smell that rose from below it. The small pig spent half an hour clattering about beneath the hollowed bough (which had been carved into a small, trotter-sized staircase) before poking his snout out and announcing that it was now presentable, in an ishy kind of way, and please could they come below, but please could they forgive the mess because he hadn't known visitors were coming. They descended, and drank a quick cup of tea - quick because he didn't have any milk, and because Piglet's home smelt strangely like a bush in flower which was desperately trying to pollinate as wide an area as possible. There were used tissues everywhere. They didn't find any Poles. Not South or North or even East, and Barnaby's mood became increasingly short, which was to say towering, until he snapped every few steps, and shouted at the Christian when he suggested they should try to see if there were any Poles in the West. At this point, Aimee said they should go home to The Other Place. She twisted her brother's hand into one of the bear's paws, and, as he disappeared, took the other. 'Did you like it there?' Amy asked, letting go of her brother's body. Aidan squirmed away and, running for the hallway, shouted, 'Didn't go anywhere!' There was a loose lean to the way he moved, so that he bumped into the jamb of the door on his way out. His footsteps - on the stairs - were slower than normal and then were lost in the roar of their mother's voice, from its apex, filling the stairwell-space as a dragon would with flames. 'Shut up, both of you. I'm trying to bloody sleep.' 'Due to the magical nature of This Place,' said Mrs Her, who took the anatomy lessons, 'nothing can die unless the Witch, or her minions, kill it.' Before her, on a set of yellow tables that had been drawn to the centre of class 8's room, was a pig head on a platter. It looked across the children's faces and said, 'Please save me.' Tower vomited in the corner. Mrs Her had placed him there, not as a sanction, but because she knew he would need the bin. Tower missed it, having turned the wrong way. Vomit belly-flopped onto the floor. Mrs Her sighed. 'Please be quiet,' she said, talking to the pig not the class, as the children were all, save the dribbling of Tower, silent. She exhibited a scapel. 'This is a scalpel. It is not a toy. If you misuse it, Angel, I hope you are listening, I will not replace your eye. Do you understand?' 'Yes, Mrs Her,' said the class, as one. Mrs Her had the kind of dour features that encouraged little by way of calling out. It may have been her beard. The scalpel hovered over the scalp of the pig's head. 'When you cut, always cut away from yourself, do you understand?' 'Yes, Miss.' 'Cut what?' said the pig. Mrs Her's hand sawed backward and forward, before slicing into the back of the pig's head. 'Ahhh, arggggggghhh, arrrrrrrgggghhhhhh,' said the Pig. 'By the Witch, that stings. Argggggghhh' Ah, that's better. Did you stop?' Ignoring him, Mrs Her said, 'Once you are beyond the nerve layers of the head, and into the skull, your animal will no longer feel any pain.' 'That's quite a relief,' said the Pig. To Aimee, he sounded sarcastic. Mrs Her put her fingers into the gap she had carved. With a crack that bought Aimee's adrenal gland to attention, the teacher unhinged its skull. 'Somebody do something,' said the Pig. Nobody moved. 'Spineless bastards,' it added. 'Now, pigs are generally very intelligent creatures. This specimen may well be an exception, by the look of its brains.' 'And human women are supposed to be", "label": 1}
{"text": "clean shaven,' said the Pig. Beneath her fringe, which was extensive but not as long as her beard, Mrs Her's eyes glinted. The scalpel did the same, as she waved it. 'First'' A droplet of blood landed on Aimee's upper lip. Mrs Her was exceedingly strict, and Aimee didn't dare move to wipe it off. It headed toward her mouth. '' you will encounter the Parietal lobe. This area of the brain'' Mrs Her picked up the Pig Head and turned it. ('I feel dizzy,' said the Pig.) '' is responsible for Perception, making sense of the world, and arithmetic, as well as spelling.' Tower looked up, a stricken pause straightening his lips. 'Don't worry, Tower, I didn't say spelling test. This, according to what Mr Him tells me, is the part of brain you may not have.' She pointed with the blade. Tower blinked, then, turning, vomited on the wall. Mrs Her resumed cutting, pulling the platter beneath the head slightly to the side, so as to deposit the gristle of its brain. The scalpel tinkled as she smeared it off. 'So, Pig,' she said. 'What is one add one?' 'Window,' said the Pig, through gritted teeth. 'And how do spell 'pig'?' 'Are you taking the piss?' 'And how do you spell 'vegetable'?' Mrs Her growled. 'G' E'T'F'U'C'P'T,' it said. Mrs Her's beard shifted. Maybe, thought Aimee, she was smiling. 'Below the Parietal lobe,' continued the teacher, 'if you dig diagonally forward and downward, is the Temporal lobe. This takes care of your memory, your understanding, and your language.' 'Where am I?' said the Pig, abruptly. 'Oh, you are a funny pig,' said Mrs Her. 'Who are you?' Pig's eyes tried to peer backward, and failed. 'I have a head flake,' it said. 'It hurts like purple poo pyjamas.' The class desperately wanted to laugh, particularly the boys, Aimee could tell, and they swelled, as though holding in mass flatulence. Mrs Her dispersed the children to their tables. Gulping slightly, Aimee raised her scalpel. Infront of her, thankfully, was not a pig's head, but a trotter. She brought the blade to it, in small, hesitating butterfly strokes of movement, but, as the metal touched the skin, and raised the blonde hairs on it, the trotter jumped off the table. Retrieving it, Aimee noticed her palms were sweating. 'Right,' said Mrs Her. 'Begin your dissection.' Mr Him was wearing his tweed jacket, the one with the black elbow patches, which meant they were doing Chemistry. 'H20' Was written in long, laconically sloping lines on the blackboard, which reinforced this impression. Mr Him hit the letters with the end of a metre stick, and struck the number, saying, 'H20, does anyone know what this is?' Class Seven didn't answer, apart from Angel, who muttered what sounded like, 'Yep, it's boring.' Peter snorted and Mr Him struck the pocked, yellowed, chemical-stricken wood in front of him with the stick. It bounced, as did Peter, on his seat ' which was a high, unbacked stool. 'Water!' said Mr Him. 'Has he wet himself?' asked Brains. 'H20 is the chemical symbol for water. And, Brains, I don't suppose you know what this means, do you?' Brains did his best, by the look of his twitching right eye, to stare in a straight direction at the blackboard, where Mr Him was pointing at the end of the chemical symbol. 'Water,' said Brains. 'No, this!' said Mr Him, reapplying the ruler-stick to the O. 'Water,' said Brains, without changing his tone. Mr Him's sight went limp; lifeless. He kept going, regardless, 'The O is for Oxygen. This tells us that oxygen is in water. Air is in water. And what do I keep telling you is in the air, in This Place?' Sunshine raised her hand. Mr Him looked at it, then at the rest of the class. Her arm was alone. 'Sunshine?' he said, in the same manner as another person might say 'just get it over with and shoot me'. 'Magic,' said Sunshine, in the same tone of voice. Mr Him stared at her, his eyes reanimating. 'Yes! Yes!' He struck the desk in front of Tower who started and oscillated as though hit by an earthquake. 'Water has air in it and, ergo, magic.' Aimee, along with the rest of the class, didn't question Mr Him on what Ergo Magic did. 'And that magic can be used to teleport. Today, we will be experimenting on teleportation. In short, we will be teleporting Ink Neepers.' Bending, Mr Him retrieved a shoe box from behind his bench. He put it on top of the wood, opened the lid (which was holed), before reaching in to pick up a man. He was, as Aimee had heard Mr Him say; short; in fact; he was incredibly short. Aimee had only ever seen an Ink Neeper once before, and then in a scurry of motion that had sent her class screaming, and running for the far wall, and the teaching assistant for the caretaker. The Christian had arrived and cornered the tiny figure in a chest of drawers, which he had wheeled into the playground and left, open, overnight, before retrieving it, Ink-Neeper-less. About the size of a mouse, but considerably slimmer, the Ink Neeper was a faerie-like humanoid who was addicted to sniffing ink and, when clutched by ink withdrawal, chewed pens until they leaked into their miniscule mouths. Pens often went missing in the Night School and the teachers would, quite pertinently, blame this on the Ink Neepers. The small figure emitted a whining scream like that of a toy fire engine and attempted to bite Mr Him's finger. Mr Him held him by the ankle, and, using his spare hand, lifted a length of bunson burner tubing, which was attached to a water tap. The tap was, as was to be expected, attached to a sink. The tap was on, and liquid dribbled out onto the bench, and the floor. 'If you gather round, children''", "label": 1}
{"text": "They did so. '' you will see me place this Ink Neeper into the end of the tubing.' Mr Him forced the Ink Neeper's head into the tube. Before disappearing, the mouth wailed, then, the Neeper was underwater, and only bubbles emerged. 'Now,' said Mr Him, firmly gripping the Neeper's writhing legs in between his thumb and forefinger. 'The Ink Neeper really wants to get out. He is drowning. However,' Mr Him grunted as the faerie kicked his thumb, bending it backward. '' little bugger' he cannot go back, because I am bunging the gap.' The creature was now fully in the tubing, misshaping it into the form of a small, twitching man. Aimee began to sweat, and realised she was holding her breath. 'So, at some point, he will bend all of his will into going down the tube ' but it is too narrow. Eventually, his emotions will spark the magic in the air in the water of the tube, and he will teleport down its length'' A POP interrupted Mr Him. The Ink Neeper had fallen from the end of the tubeless, second tap of the sink, and into the basin. It breathed heftily, arms seeming to conduct its lungs. 'Oh' there! It's done it!' said Mr Him. The Ink Neeper clamoured out of the sink and ran, leaving tiny, puddle footprints. 'Get it!' As the children scattered after the scurrying Neeper, Mr Him shouted. 'The magic can be used to transverse any pipe, or plumbing. It's got my fountain pen! Stop it.' Giggling and gurgling ink, the Neeper ran under a bench. In bed, the wall stained orange in the same way as her fingers were stained yellow by Laburnum pods, Amy stared across at Barney but didn't reach out to him. His eyes were opals, glistening with their own light, as though with tears, or rage. There would be little point reaching out to Barney as, angled as he was, there was nothing to reach out to. Amy had torn off his right arm and it lay, fingerless, in the utter black beneath her bed. Yes, I hated her, and more than I had ever hated another child. But I was proud of her, through the tears of pain, for being by far the cleverest little girl I had ever known. Her brother was getting sicker and I knew, you see ' then, what she planned. Even through the pain I could see. It's amazing what children's minds are capable of. Amy closed her eyes and shut off her mind and, without Barney's arm to reel her in, swam into blank darkness and dreamlessly slept. Chapter 5 IN WHICH AMY GIVES AIDAN A PRESENT AND A POISON-INDUCED COMA 'Wake up you stupid little bitch.' And again. 'Come here you stupid bitch.' Before she could do the first, Amy had done the second and stood, uncertain on the landing carpet as she was on her thoughts. Aidan was in mam's arms, lips blue as his baby eyes. He had the hue of pork from Iceland. Mam said, 'Get a fucking move on, get a fucking move on,' as though swearing was soon to be unfashionable. Momentarily, Amy thought she had poisoned him too much, but the boy choked and hacked on an unconscious breath. 'Give me him, pet,' said Uncle Chris. Amy didn't even notice her ignoring him. The sound of Uncle Chris talking was a little like the writing at the beginning of Alien. Somehow, he seemed to be screaming. In this case, though, it wasn't that no-one could hear, it was that no-one was listening. She was listening to her Mam, 'What are you doing just standing there? Go and get dressed.' There was a question in there someplace, and a swear word hidden underneath it. But Amy couldn't feel her legs or her brain, only a growing panic, her heart billowing in her chest, inking her arm with pins and needles. 'Are you trying to kill your brother? Are you trying to kill him? Go and get dressed.' Standing between her door and Aidan's, between the papercut of her mother's frame, and the odour of Chris (who smelt as though he had been swilled speculatively around a can of Stella), Amy was falling, but not in a good way. Her skin was flaking away in thin, rubberised curls like the snakeskins of truck tyres on the A1. Her baby was all blue. The sight snapped her out and she receded back down the landing like a turned-off TV set - to her white, wooden bedroom door. Bruquely, all thumb and no fingers, all bones and no flesh, she touched it, its trunculent thick paintwork, its stiff lips of pine, like it could protect her, like it was solid. She didn't trust it. Her Mam had taught her that, by how she was in public. The caresses to her head. The faux grins. The warm words. The door slid open. The shush of its progress over cheap carpet was restrained ' churchy - and reminded her ear of the sound of falling into the glade in the Latter Wood. She wanted to go there. She could see, despite the shadows, in the ravines of her bed, Barney. He didn't look too good. She grasped Barney's stump, at the shoulder. 'I'm sorry Barnaby,' she said. She let him fall and, instead, took his arm. The hospital smelt somewhere between disinfectant and vomit, as if it had swallowed the first and retched the second. Amy sat and shut off her senses and waited. Aidan is close to God. That's what Uncle Chris said. Maybe Aidan can smell Him. Her lower-legs, where she sat, fell from her knee in two lines of smudged white cotton and wash-bled love-hearts. She had not changed from her pyjamas. She had forgotten to, when she took Barney's arm, and her Mam would not wait. Amy could not reach the mussed trenches of the hopital's weary carpet with her toes, but didn't", "label": 1}
{"text": "swing her legs. They fell urine-line straight. She tried to recall when her mother had washed the leggings, but couldn't. She thought she was in shock, at what she, a wilful bairn, had done. Besides which, her Mam was distracting her. Her Mam was screaming at the doctors and nurses with an open mouth like a big, round full stop that went on forever. Amy wondered if that was what God looked like. An infinite full stop. Amy closed her eyes until she could see Aidan. His mouth was off-colour. Amy was not entirely surprised. She had smeared the yellow stain on his dusky lips, like Laburnum trees seen at speed, at the edge of a twilight glade. Barney's arm was inside her pyjama-top, cuddling the bottom rung of her ribcage. 'Stupid l----e f-----ng bitch, what does she th'k she is d---g?' The sound of her came and went fast as he did, these days, in bed. He blocked her out, when she wasn't talking to him, and not her alone. He often blocked himself out. Christopher had become something he could not be. At least he could have a couple of drinks, and forget that he had ever been anything better. He came, most often with her, before he had even taken his pants off. She mocked him for it, which didn't help. Amy stood over her brother's hospital bed, leaning forward. In her grip, and forced into Aidan's unmoving fingers, seemed to be the arm of a teddy bear. 'Leave the poor bairn alone,' Christopher said, looking at his hands. When he wasn't drunk his voice reminded him of his mother's. She always called him 'Christopher', even though no one else did. Most of the time, these days, his name was four-lettered, followed by an 'er'. 'What? What did you say to me?' There was curl of a lip that may as well have been a fist into his. 'Say that again' one more fucking time.' Christopher frowned, trying to muster all of him in his face. There was a weight on his corneas, dragging them down. The hospital room was leaning in on him, walls and all. Panicing inside, he thought he might cry. The young doctor and a grey, curly-haired nurse turned to look at each other. Christopher didn't say anything. His mouth made the round childish 'o' its lips knew from the shape of a Kwik Save own brand rum bottle. 'She's not mine,' she said. 'I swear to God that bairn is not mine. And she sure as Hell isn't yours, you faggot. You being so bloody soft on her, that's what made this.' She pointed at Amy. 'No child of mine would turn out like this.' 'Um, I'm sorry,' said the doctor. The silence after his word was raw. The ward seemed to hold more blood than it was used to, to have admitted more wounds than it could plaster. 'Come and it down with us, please. You have been through more than we can possibly imagine. But so has your daughter.' 'Daughter? What bloody daughter?' The nurse is looking at me, thought Christopher, like I should do something. He often felt the eyes of the world on him, and often when they could not possibly be watching; when he was in the lounge, or the bedroom; when he was alone. His fists narrowed as he found himself unable to move. I've got to help that little girl, he thought, but his hands wouldn't reach out to the child, and his lips could not speak. All of him really wanted a drink. Staring at her mother, the little girl removed the brown, dismembered, teddy-arm she had placed in her brother's linen, and walked away to the waiting room. An old man approached, bent over and vulnerable, like a snail that had lost its shell. He sat on the chair next to Amy, which was pink-cushioned and of a far ruddier hue than his skin 'Hallo, there,' he said, smiling down at her, and inclining his neck so that his head was above her shoulder. Amy looked up without reply. 'Is that your brother?' he said. Amy continued to look up without reply. 'In there?' he inclined the already inclining head and his neck creaked as though complaining that it, really, would rather not. 'My baby,' said Amy. The old man frowned. His hair was tentacles on his scalp, long and thin and black. Amy wondered if there was a monstrous squid, on the other side of his head, eating his brains. His scalp reminded her of Mr Him. 'Oh, I see'' said the old man, '' baby brother.' Amy's Mam had told her not to talk to strangers. Strangers were dangerous. Besides which, she didn't like the smell of this one. 'Are you worried about him?' said the old man. Amy thought about this ' not about answering but about how to stop the old man talking to her. She didn't want to be rude. After consideration, she waved the old man closer, cupped her hand to his waxy cheek and said the phrase she had heard countless times before, which she accepted as being the best way to end a conversation, and quickly. The old man leaned in. Amy whispered, 'Shut the fuck up, you little bitch.' The old man looked at her with two brown eyes that seemed to be abruptly dampening. Shit stuck to a toilet, thought Amy. He got up and walked over to the pink chair he had recently vacated, his skin more approximating its colour, now. The smell was everywhere. Not just on her nose, or in her nostrils, but soaking her brain. Her organs had the feel of aliens in saline tanks. Knowledge saturated her, as did one thought; I'm running out of time. But Amy had to wait. No matter if there was little of his spirit left, if she could hear the eek of it eeking away. This was the place, the room, to", "label": 1}
{"text": "wait. It said so on the sign. Amy felt her face go burnt-soup red. She sighed a breath fecund with everything she could not say, and rose. She walked through the closed, double, swing doors, by the murmuring doctor, past three cubicles, then right, and to her baby; a blue smudge in hospital whites. The machine by her head beeped. She ignored it. There were purple spots in the edge of the room, mainly on the ceiling. Amy watched them with the corners of her eyes. The pupils were all for him. Her baby was gone, almost. There was the lightest of wind as his soul drifted away. Amy pushed the light-beige arm, a baguette almost cream in colour, deep into his hospital linen, and closed his small palm until it eclipsed the thumb-nail shape of the teddy bear's felt palm. 'What are you doing, sweetheart?' Amy half-turned and, inside her chest, her heart had a full turn of its own. A nurse stood behind her, staring at Amy, then at the bump of the teddy bear's severed arm below her brother's linen, then back to Amy. The little girl had watched Godfather with Uncle Chris and thought, obscurely, of a horse's head. 'Oh, sweetheart, is that part of your teddy bear?' Amy considered this. In her experience, every interaction with an adult was worthy of careful thought. In the end, she nodded. The nurse was gun-grey haired in curls that framed a pasty, wan face. She looked like a Grandma. Not Amy's Granny, but somebody's. She smiled at the child. 'It'll be our secret,' she said, winking. Her eyes were darker than all the rest of her skin tone put together, and reminded Amy of pulled bath-plugs. Her cheeks were pale and drained. 'I'll make sure they don't take it away, pet.' The doctors said 'go home'. Amy heard them as she past her mother, walking back to the Waiting Room. The doctors said, 'there's nothing more that you can do. He's critical but stable.' They were, thought Amy, wrong. They couldn't see that his soul had almost gone to the Other Place. Her mother had gone home. She didn't try to stay. To cuddle Aidan. She had let him go and had grasped the outer edges of her elbows, and rocked on the spot gently. Amy had not stopped to watch, and had returned to her seat and tried to pretend she had never left it. Amy was lucky. She didn't know what a STD was, or how it felt on the skin, and so had nothing with which to compare the itching, maddening sensation of the drive home. The image of her baby brother was inked to her, sharp as any tattoo. She knew where he was right now ' in the glade in the midst of a ring of Laburnum Trees, in the long grass. In the middle of the night there were things in the Latter Wood that would make man-eating bears seem like vegans. Amy had to get to That Place. It was well past her bedtime and she longed for a teddy to cuddle. Nobody spoke. Mam was wrapped in her own arms and, having snapped at Chris' sympathy, coated in silence. Chris indicated and pulled into the estate. There was the clenched-teeth sound of the car coming to a stop on gravel, and Amy got out, before the adults. They unlocked the door and she hurried in, and upstairs, and undressed, and slipped in between her undersheet and her duvet. She didn't look at her teddy bear as she reached out to him, or at the damage she had done. She could feel the wound on her fingertips, rough as old scars, with tight curls of stuffing impinging on the air like the guts of the rabbit she had seen, once, on a country road. Her fingers crawled around his abdomen and she found his other side, and she took his remaining paw. The drop into Barnaby's world was an outrushing breath that was met by one of Aimee's own. She hit its ground running; knowing where her baby would be. He had been left by her intervention, as exposed in this world as any would-be changling. His skin would be cold and numb and wooden feeling as a goblin child pretending to be human. And grey as well. She hoped his skin hadn't turned blue, for, if it had, there would be little to be done to save him, even in This Place, where magic was in the air. Aimee felt panic inside her. It was turning her inside out, blushing her skin, pushing her heart hard against her ribcage. She parted the grass, like the hand that parted the reeds on Moses. There was no crying, not here, though she knew he lay beyond the silhouettes of vegetation. She leant in and saw that his eyes were closed, his skin drawn about them, as it was about his small mouth, which was a darker shadow of red as if it had rent itself by screaming too long, wailing for help in the alien night. He's dead, she would have thought, if there was time for it, but didn't, and grasped him up, against her bursting chest. She ran. The grass was unhelpful hands on her knees, her hips, and her elbows, where she swaddled him. Her lilac dress was bunched about his body, at the front, with its ruffs of white drowning him in material spume. Laburnum Trees loomed, entangled and noxious as memories of trauma, half-seen in the dark. Under their eaves could be heard strange things, crawling. There was a smell on the wind, and not that of a baby turning blue. No, it was the odour of a world that was falling into anarchy. Aimee had transgressed a rule. There was something rotten in This Place, and Aimee knew it was what she had done. She ran under the canopy of Laburnum Trees. 'Come on, come on,'", "label": 1}
{"text": "she said. Her breath was hot and fast on the little boy's face. He didn't reply. She tripped on a tree root, stumbled, and fell, into a swell of earth, and down a fold. There was a muffled shattering, as glass would make inside a nakin, from her right arm. She looked down, but not at it, at him. He hadn't changed in any way, unless it was to go a deeper blue. Now she noticed a smell of blood. It wasn't his, or hers, though she could feel her own, making the arm of her lilac dress darker, and longer. The odour was too animal. There were predators in here. The minions of the Witch were abroad. Amy rose and, again, ran. There was a crash in the undergrowth. Twigs snapped and shredded. Whatever was out here, was both uncoordinated and big. The Night School was close, but could not be seen between the dense bunching of shadows. A crackling of ripped vegetation came from close by, near her right shoulder. She darted left, her small red right shoe making a question mark in the soil. Whatever pursued her passed over it, a moment later. It had breath big as a bonfire, and hot, and smelling of cooked, if not burnt, meat. Then, it was on her, grasping her by her long, blonde hair. For the first time, in This Place, she wished she had Amy's dank bob. Pain became a lever in her skull, and she jerked still, and then was borne back into her pursuer's arms. Into its arm. One bear limb reached round and picked her up. She could smell the stunt of the other one; leaking and torn. The bone in her arm was a many-forked lightning rod of pain. 'Hold still, girl,' the bear said. 'We are not alone.' 'I'm sorry, Barnaby,' she said, through teeth gritted so that they would sieve out the screams. 'Shut up,' he said, not unkindly. There was sniffling in the dark. Amy had watched Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, one Christmas Day, when Uncle Chris had passed out on the settee, and Mam was at the bar. The sound remained Aimee of the Child Catcher. It was closing. Whatever it was had wet, fecund nostrils, like the tunnels of worms. There was also the slapping, slapping, slapping of an awkward eater. Russian Dolls, thought Aimee. She knew the thought was right, but didn't say it out loud. Slowly, Barnaby lowered his bulk to the dirt. They hunkered down behind a holly bush. 'Don't sit on me,' said a grasshopper. Barnaby squashed him, with a quick, anxious step. The sniffing stopped. 'Hmmm,' said a voice that seemed to come up from below layers of flesh. 'Somebody hiding behind that holly bush, eh? Well you know what they say about little girls hiding behind holly bushes, eh? No? Well, I don't either. I don't think they say anything much about that, and why would they? Very unlikely to happen, my dears.' The slapping resumed. It sounded for all This Place like the creatiure was eating its own lips. 'Run,' said Barnaby. 'Don't think I will,' said the creature, tearing the bush out of the dirt in one, looping action. Aimee did. Barnaby charged, one armed, against the monster. Behind her, she could hear the sound of a mutilated bear being borne to the ground and its roars as the thing bit deep. Then, Barnaby's screams sounded as human as his breath smelt. The gates of The Night School came into sight. Her name was Disdivanshumayl and, needless to say, it was as hard for Mr Him to pronounce as it was to remember. He did so as Dis ('insult') Divan (the local word for 'don't') Shumayl (a spider's family name). Disdivanshumayl was woollen-skinned and blind in seven of her eight eyes. The one good eye didn't look at all healthy, and most often not in the right direction. 'What did you say?' Disdivanshumayl said. 'Uh,' said Mr Him. It was hard to argue with the teaching assistants. Not only were they, in the Night School, supernatural beasts, they also tended to be older than the teachers. In this case, several centuries older. 'Miss!' said Angel. 'Miss! It's Aimee! She's late.' Angel seemed to take some joy from this. The classroom door opened too fast, it seemed, for its safety mufflers, which creaked and snapped. Aimee was surrounded by purple shadows - the last of twilight before it becomes night - her eyes were set back under her forhead, her petticoat muddied, her shoes nothing more than two clogs of earth. In her arms she held a bundle that looked worse than she did, which was hard. It also looked rigored, by death. Mr Him said, 'What are you carrying Aimee?' The girl swayed where she stood, beside the lava table, perhaps from the weight of carrying the body of what appeared to be a boy, perhaps because of the fumes that rose from the magma. Mr Him did not wait for Disdivanshumayl, and rose, skirting the carpet-seated children. He walked to Aimee, pulled apart her arms, and took the child from her. The little boy was not dead; Mr Him could see the stir of artery on his neck, but barely. His lips were open, and whispering. His skin burnt hot, but in the way of a firework on the wet November grass, dampened and squibbed yet still dangerous. The boy's hands were clawed, rigid, with each finger pointing at a ceiling tile. Look, they seemed to be saying, dead spiders. It was a good thing Disdivanshumayl could not see. 'Sunshine,' he said, 'Get Mrs Her.' He needed a first aider. The children were off their carpet bottoms, and on inquisitive feet, cluttered around the three of them - their teacher, their classmate, and the dying child. 'And Mrs Disdivanhumayl, could you take the register?' Carrying the blue robed toddler, Mr Him ran to the junk modelling bin. The boy's soul", "label": 1}
{"text": "of probability, it probably didn't happen at all. Still, there was a sensation like being pulled through the carpet and through a crack in the floorboards below it. She coughed, a singular, cancer's kind of hack, threaded with threat, and wet. She opened her eyes. The bedroom had been taken away and replaced. As had Amy. She felt fresh as the odour of green she could now smell. There was grass beneath her feet and it was dense, each leaf piled one over the other, and lapping to give the impression of richness, even through the hardness of her red shoes. Trees clustered nearby and below one, which stood wide and proud and almost smug, sat a small, wooden hut. The hut slouched in its sitting position and was slightly obscured by the sign before it. The sign said, in ramshackle writing; 'Pooh Bears House'. As in the Other Places, here; Amy was called Aimee. 'Oh, Aimee, isn't that cute?' said Barnaby, who stood beside her. 'He forgot the apostrophe. Why, that means he's a bit silly, a bit forgetful, but a jolly, nice, old bear! It doesn't mean he's thick at all.' Aimee let go of his paw. 'Don't be such a grumpy bear,' she said. 'Are you saying I'm bloody well like him? A silly, old, grumpy bear? I could eat your head in one gulp, you know that, don't you, girl?' Aimee smiled. 'Come on.' She walked toward Pooh Bear's house. The sky above them was blue and unspecked. It made her think of Aidan's eyes. 'Oh, God. Are we actually going to visit? He'll make me eat honey. No bloody raw meat for me, oh no. No fish. Just jars and jars of bloody honey. No wonder he's such a fat, boring'' Aimee ignored him and started to skip. The lilac dress she wore in her dreams rustled as though the grass continued up to the straps at her slight, translucent shoulders. She couldn't taste eggs anymore. Barnaby continued, '' and he never remembers anything you say. He's like a goldfish. Oh, there's a jar of honey!..I forgot it was there!... Oh, there's a jar of honey! Idiot. I hope Piglet's there. Do you hear me, little girl? I hope Piglet's visiting. Do you have any apple sauce, little girl?' I know what you're thinking. I'm leading Amy on; taking her places that aren't real. Leading her up the garden path to play with fake faeries, round and round with teddy bears. Giving her false hope. But no hope is false, not in the dark of a child's room where there are fingers that can be felt but can't be seen. Besides, you're reading the words of a talking bear. What kind of state is your mind in? And does it have princesses, witches, those flying monkeys? Can you find the glade in the magical wood, or do you see nothing but the trees? Chris laughed and looked at Amy. Their eyes and smiles met then parted. Amy liked Uncle Chris when he was Chris, and not Step-Dad, which he changed into when Mam was home, becoming as thin-skinned and dented as the aluminium can in his fingers. She had that effect on men, Mam. She was at the pub, working. Earning, she would say to Uncle Chris, before saying a whole lot more about how he wasn't. Amy shifted, but felt comfortable in the wide expanse of the peach settee, camouflaged as a mosquito on tepid water. Her pyjamas were little longer than a mini-skirt that carried on going up, and skin-coloured, plastered to Amy by the greasiness of both her body and her hair. Her Mam had said she'd given up on making her clean, that she was naturally dirty. Most days, except Sundays, Amy went unbathed. The house was warm. Chris always turned the thermostat until it clicked when Mam was out, and allowed Amy to cuddle Barney in the lounge. He let Amy sit alone on the settee. Chris never asked for a cuddle. In the old video-player, Aliens played. All Chris watched were horror films: Dawn of The Dead, The Evil Dead, The Thing, The Omen, Labyrinth. Only the last gave her nightmares. Chris hadn't warned her it was a true story. Amy imagined the infant Toby in the goblin's maze, and her thighs and neck goosebumped, going pale and cold as cuts of poultry. Her baby brother was upstairs, sleeping. Bump by bump, her skin smoothed, calmed by Aidan's repose. He seemed safe, for now. It was in the night, when she was asleep, that Amy worried. Amy did a lot of worrying while she slept, and all she fretted about was how to stop what happened to her, happening to him. 'I love this bit. Ewww,' said Chris, grinning at the girl. His eyes left her quickly, as they did whenever she wore her jamies. Amy nodded and smiled briefly. Chris loved everything, according to his mouth. He loved her Mam to bits. He loved the bairns to bits. He loved his life to bits. Occasionally, his eyes crumbled and washed away; all the more often when he'd been drinking. Uncle Chris did not, according to Mam, watch his drink. Amy didn't understand why he would want to watch Stella, or stare at Kwik Save's Own Brand Rum. She guessed it was the same as Mam telling her to watch her mouth. Amy had tried and it made her dizzy. (Amy couldn't bear to look in the mirror, though that would have made the watching easier.) Still, those times were better than when Mam said she should wash her mouth out. Her Mam bought cheap soap, and you could tell, just by the taste. Amy had seen Alien many times before, but not Aliens. The actors were in a room made of metal and glass jars in which were suspended the aliens. Chris said something, and if Amy had heard she would have smiled, but her legs were jiggling", "label": 1}
{"text": "was bleeding out. The door opened as Mrs Her rushed in. 'Put him on the table,' she said. Mr Him swept the volcano to the side. It clattered on the floor and sent out scorching black lines of lava. Small meteors of discharged rock steamed toward the pupils, where they sat, on the carpet. Mrs Disdivanshumayl shouted as they shuffled away, 'Bottoms!' Aimee's brother lay golemed on the tabletop. Mrs Her plunged her hand into the junk modelling bin and came up with a pair of lungs that sucked in the classroom's air. She loped to the boy, pressed the windpipe that hung, umbilical from the pair of lungs, to his lips. 'Hold it here,' she commanded. Mr Him did so. She returned to the bin and, despite her height, disappeared to her hips within it, her beard hanging, Mr Him imagined, in the darkness. She re-emerged, spluttering, with a heart in her hand that spurted indignant splutters of blood. Nothing really died in the This Place, thought Mr Him, not even the organs of the dead, unless the Witch or her minions killed it. The graveyard was good for school resources. 'Why is he dying?' asked Mr Him, abruptly. 'Did the Witch do this?' 'No,' Mrs Her replied. Tottering to the table, slipping on a line of red that had spurted out from the heart, Mrs Her grasped a pair of scissors. 'I think he's dying on the Other Side.' She returned and cut the boy's robes up the centre. Underneath, he was naked. Mr Him tried not to look, but as at an accident, he felt compelled. He blushed the colour of the liquid that squeezed across the boy's belly as Mrs Her went further, disceting into his ribs with the scissors. The bones made the crunch of eating cornflakes before they softened. Into the rift, she pressed the heart. 'This will massage his,' she said. Lungs and heart flailed while those within the boy seemed still. Beat. Suck. Beat. The adults stood. Mrs Disdivanshumayl had finished the register, and the classroom was silent. The boy turned his head in a jerk. The boy spat. The boy screamed and Mrs Her, unseen beneath her beard, smiled and said, 'Get me some string. I need to stich this up.' Part 2 Chapter 1 IN WHICH THE WITCH AWAKES, AND GOES ABROAD All eight of Mrs Divanshumayl's eyes jerked wide-open as Aimee collapsed. There was the sound of an impact as thick as the spider's hide. 'Ah' Mr Him?' she said. Mrs Her said, to Mr Him, 'Get me some string. I need to stich him up.' The him Mrs Her talked of was Aimee's little brother, but the teaching assistant had none of her eight eyes for the boy, only for the collapsed girl. Panic made the teaching assistant's legs skittish. Mrs Disdivanshumayl pulled herself together, and up to her fullest height, which, of course, was the ceiling. Looking down on the ' now bottomed- pupils at on the carpet, she said, 'Angel, pick her up! Take her to the office! Quick!' The office was where the plasters were, and the skin-grafts, and the spare arms, for when they were fallen on, as Aimee had. 'Owwwah,' said Angel. 'What?' The teaching assitant's hair bristled, and there was a lot of it to do so. 'WHAT?' 'Nothin',' said the boy, who rose, straddled the little girl's inert frame, and pulled hers to his, pressing Aimee to his chest, as he struggled against her weight. Aimee's thick hair fell downward. One thin pale arm rose on its own accord, and hung out awkwardly. If Disdivanshumayl had belonged to the Other Place, it would have reminded her of Stephen King's Carrie at her prom - all blood and not much by way of visible skin. Momentarily, Aimee looked as though she were about to grasp Angel, though her pale eyes were closed. Being of This Place, Disdivanshumayl thought of a prince and princess, before she blinked most of her eyes, and remembered these children were too experienced for such childish nonsense. 'Go,' she said, watching the blood welting off the pupil, falling in half congealed lumps from her hand like Turkish Delights. Grunting, Angel ' who was stouter than he looked - swung the bloodied arm around his shoulder, and the girl toward the exit. 'Tower,' the boy growled, and Tower was on his feet and at the door, opening it. Made to limp by his burden, Angel walked into the corridor, and out of sight. 'promisemepromisemepromiseme,' Aimee was mumuring, to the shirt on his shoulder, her voice like a four year old's writing, all forgotten finger spaces and missing Capital Letters. 'Oh, put a full stop in it,' said Angel, meaning to say 'sock', but his mind was reeling as much as his body. He had, though, made it his habit not to complain (or his father had), and so just kept walking. 'promisemepromisemepromiseme'' They were nearly at the office. Behind them was trail of blood, in smudged zigzags. 'promisepromisepromise'' 'What?' he said. It was the last of his breath and it came out vicously, as though a kicked can Her eyes lolled to him, seeming to stick to his own, in much the same way as her body had collapsed against his side. 'Promise me you'll take care of him'' 'Who?' he asked, though he knew. 'Promise me'' There was a crackle of displaced bone as she hefted up her arm and flapped at him with its hand. 'Promise me.' 'That's broken.' 'A promise on a broken hand is a promise that lasts forever,' she whispered, as though she had heard it somewhere before. Her eyes were larger than they had any right to be. Angel thought she might be about to pass out. 'A promise on a broken hand..?' he asked. He hadn't heard that one before, but it sounded intuitively right, and the children of the Night School put more faith in their guts than other children had", "label": 1}
{"text": "to. 'Promise'' He nodded. Spat on his left palm. Held her hand. Felt the blood rise between his fingers, and his spittle ooze between hers. He imagined it mixing. She shook him, in three violent jerks, each producing that grazing, gravelly crackle of bones chafing. Each time the sound seemed to say- this is too much, this is the something that should not happen. But she did it again, and again. 'Promised,' she whispered. They had reached the red chairs outside the office, where sick or injured children sat and waited for their guardians to pick them up, or plasters to be applied. He nodded. 'Promised,' he repeated and lowered her almost gently onto the nearest chair. It was then that he realised she was fading. His eyes widened, but not to be as big as hers, nor as large as the gap his mouth made when he shouted, 'Help!' The receptionist ran out- a cockroach the size of a baby elephant. All the legs helped when she needed to carry lunch registers, or plasters, as she did now. 'Out way,' she chattered. 'Is she dying?' said Angel. 'No,' plasters slapped against flesh, and blood recoated the chair. 'Passing out. She'll be back.' 'promised'' whispered Aimee and she was gone, leaving only the word, and the feel of her blood coating Angel's right hand, and the smell of it, which was sharp as metal. , or it ran around her, like water runs. She felt swallowed. It wa only7 tickily that she realied Mrs Her wa creaming at her. 'We need to get him back your classroom. What are you doing here? ' Mr rochey was going red. Her kin wa rewtless on her head. She shouted. 'Why?' 'We need a creative tray.' He gave up, or o it seemed with speech, grabbing the baby. She followed him,as she limped into a run. The run back to the classroom had the ssensation of time lost, watyer down the drain. Mrs Didivanshuymayl was saying; 'I'll write your name on the sad head,' (Mr Rochey could hear the head cackling oftly on the blackboard, it took thi to make it happy, even for a moment) and then she was hovering behind Mr Her,a the creative table, feeling like a abutterfly that didn't know wher to put it wings. 'Sit down! Sit down, I said.' Mrs Disdivanshuymayl was saying. The children were doing little in the way of listening. 'Can I help?Can I help?' They said, puhing and milling., Mrs Rochey felt like saying the ame thing,but her throat tuck in her neck. 'Get them away from me.' Said Mr Her, pulling off the lid of the creative tray. Alone, Aimee tood in the centre of the classroom carpet. She looked lost.. 'Children, back pleae, please children.' Aid Mrs Rochey. 'Right, back now.' Mr Didivanhuymayl was uing her arms, pulling back eight at a time. 'Need skin.' Aid Mr Her. he threw aside a leg, then a human arm, from th creative table. It wa golem making term, for the year fours, and a series of mialigned and malhaped dolls were hung from the ceiling, moaning in existential angt, and organic pain. 'kin, skin, kin.' A hearty burt on the laminate flooring. A kidney lithered under the map of England, discarded. A gall bladder burt on amuel' face, and he gagged, and went greener than the bile that ran down hi cheeks. Slowly, he passed out. 'Here.' aid Mr Her, and, as if it were a fire blanket, pressed adowny covering of kin (a couple of ize too big) to the baby' shape. It began to form to him claying across hi body. It went from slippy to fast. 'Right, right take your time.' Mr Her backed away, lifted her hands. She was no longer touching the bbaby. 'It not going to survive.' Aid a mouth from the bin. 'Maybe it would, if it had a new mouth. How about me, I could you a body.' Mr Her dropped a lung into the bin. There was amuffled sound, like omething trying to speak but unable to stop chewing. (crazy glue - it's like crazy, man) Elton John had been wrong, and that ong that uncle Chri liked to put on- aturday Night was no night for fighting. It was bath night. For the ret of her life, for a long as it would lat, Amy would think of bath night as a time from which he would emerge dirtied. He wouldn't be able to rest, on Saturday evening, would watch X\\ Factor with something unidentified crawling through her inards. For Chri, Saturday night, like any other was a night for drinking, and for not noticing, until hi eyes became blank a the water that came out of the mould grimed taps. Most of the time, the water would lobster Amy' skin (and her mum had gotten to name her), and play red-hot-poker with her kidneys, but she would scream.

{"text": "Mrs Rochey' voice, asking after her baby. 'How I he setting in.' he was aying. She knew Mr Rochey would be keeping half an eye on her baby and, when he had it pare, a full one. Now, there were three. Her erd kin went pale by trapeziums. Goose pimples flocked on ger legs, where her knee broke the cover of bubbles. Two yellow eyes were watching her baby, along with Mr Rochey blue one. SLAP. 'tay till, girl.' Said her mother. He sounded ditracted. Amy wan't really litening, but didn't move a thing. How did he find him? She thought. She aw two yellow eyes, a nursery, a blue coated, blue eyed baby boy, a Night chool, and, far to the north a tower. The witch was watching her baby. 'Aye, aye, the bairn I sleeping, like.' Like a light, thought Amy.Amy looed up at the batre bulb hanging in the centre of the room. If Amy had known about Damocles, he have thought of hi ssword. Instead, he looked down at her teddy. 'I have to fix you.' She said. 'I will.' He was crying and her finger were haking and it was hard to see the glue. He could hear it, though, the thick, alivic, rabid dog ound of it. 'Aye.' Said the voice on the phone outside. 'Her mam I cary, can't use her bed.' Bthe voice or the phone creaked. Wherever the ound came from, it distended into a laugh. 'Come round.' The laugh went coy. 'No come round. I'll chyuck the bairn out. We'll ue her bed. It' a bit melly, but what th fuck,' Amy looked at the door. Her hands froze on the bear a though he had mistakenly glued them there. 'Yeha, he can watch the wizard of Oz, or Harry potter, or some shit. Yeah, I want to do it. You're always aying you'll do it. Time to prove it, big boy.' The laughter wa back, but any coyness had been cared away. It receded by reaon ofditance, a the baybitter decenede the stair, and hut the door to the lounge, cutting the conversation off, for Amy, a much a if he had hung up. Amy knew that door. Itwe as solid. He looked at her bed, and the shadws that made veins on the linen. Memories gathered under the sheets. He ignored them, and applied Barney' arm to his body. Time wa running out, and wa snearly out of sight. Oon, she knew, he would not be able to follow it. (the wolf teddy bear comes in earlier) Barnaby reached up to try to stem the bloodlines with his padded paw. The bleeding was a hot wash down his flank and made up - in part - for the lack of feeling in his body. He heard the finger-tapping of dribbling blood in the algaed pools of rained water and realised, dim as the light in the wood, that his senses were flowing away from him. His sight gruelled into a layer of sleepy across his eyes. It was most inconveniencing, thought the bear, to lose one's arm. He couldn't, right now, put his paw on exactly what was happening to him. He felt dizzy. With his left arm he hugged a tree. There was a bumping squawk, like a bird hitting a window, and Barnaby raised his muzzle. It was wet through; from sweat, not blood. High above was the sky, just as high as it always had seemed to be. And there was the Honey Pot Star, hanging in the sweet spot in the centre of a swirling galaxy. It was only visible when the Witch's Moon began to orbit. Across what was left of the moon, and across the star, passed several silhouettes; wide-winged and heavy framed, a legion of them, flying South. One of them squawked. There was a laugh that sounded not much different from a scream. The Witch's legion flew on the winds. The Witch would awake and rise soon. Barnaby was sure of it ' in his gut; his mind had long since stopped working. He tried to let go of the tree. He thought of Aimee, and Aidan, to give himself impetus, but could remember neither of their names and, soon, could not move even his eyes. Money infested her mind, as blow flies would a corpse left in the savanna sun. Pound by pound, direct debit by standing order, the pall mounted until it blinded her. It laid its larvae in the flesh of her brain ' she could feel it wriggling. There were bigger predators than money to hunt down her mind, out there, in the long grasses of her life, not to mention what she had suffered as a child, but she ignored them and they ignored her. She sat on her settee and watched Oprah and shed a few tears. She cried at the smallest thing. Uncle Chris called her a 'soppy shite', but other names hid inside his eyes. The tears were down to her Aidan, she reckoned. Poor mite, she thought. Poor bairn, she thought. Poor pet, she thought, but she found it difficult to actually think of him. The image of his face wavered infront of her own, not so much as though a veil had been drawn between them, but as though he had been drawn through one. It was hard to think of her children as anything other than lost pounds. Good money gone after bad. Her life, she knew, was hard. Still, her bairn's image unsettled her, and she got up, and she made a coffee, and then a tea, and then a coffee, and shifted uneasily through the early afternoon. Later, she would put on her make up and her short black blouse that shortened for every year she worked behind the bar, in the local housing estate. She liked to go to work; it took her mind off money. From time to time, she would pace unevenly around the", "label": 1}
{"text": "lounge, up the green-carpeted stairs, eyes darting and thinned. (Sometimes she felt like a zombie from one of those bloody horror movies Chris was always watching.) On her wanders, she would see the footprints, here and there, of wasted money. Amy's clothes. Amy's books. Amy's sketchpad. Amy had been an accident, and an expensive one. She stopped. She had heard the sound of Aidan crying; she was sure of it; inside Amy's room; she was sure of that, as well. Her son's face floated before her, disembodied as her emotions. She opened Amy's door and stumbled into the girl's bedroom. She sat awkwardly on the terse blue carpet. Before her there lay the red-covered sketchpad, and she opened it, feeling the rough, off-colour pages and resisting, for once, the urge to tear at them. She sneered and read the entries, stared at the maps, scratched with long, unpainted fingernails at the drawings. She read about forest nymphs, and how a 'Mr Him' never took class 7 to visit them. 'Bloody ridiculous,' she said, to herself. 'Off with the bloody fairies.' She shook her head a little too vigourously, as though protesting a memory, and her eyes, as much by accident as the girl had been, saw the teddy bear under the bed. 'Bloody bitch,' she said, in an almost reverent whisper. 'She took it out of the bin. Canny, little bairn.' She crawled forward, her knees chaffing on the carpet, and slithered into the niche under the bed. When, as now, she was alone, when Chris was at the dole office, or cutting grass, or plastering for extra money, here and there, she would find herself in the tight places of the house. Sometimes, she felt as though she was hiding from something. She grasped the arm of the teddy bear and wrenched him down from between the wall and the bed and out from the shadows under the latter, back to where the sketchpad lay open, on a page decorated by a map of the Latter Wood. The teddy bear, as it turned and rolled out, only had one arm. She stared at it, holding the bear loosely in her arms, then at the sketchpad. 'Loony tunes,' she said, to herself. 'She should be in a bloody loony bin, not in my home. She can't be bloody mine.' Her fingernail traced the outline of the wood, until it reached, 'The Night School?' she said but, then, her hand slipped on the teddy's arm, and she grasped at the limb, instinctively, to stop it falling. And her hand clutched the remaining paw. And she fell. The world was a dizzying spin of darkness, but Barnaby still knew, as through and through as the stuffing in Barney, when Amy had taken the teddy bear's paw, and entered This Place. The shades that haunted his sight were not only down to the late hour, but mostly because of blood loss. The stump of his right arm welted as he breathed, ragged and through ground-down fangs. He had been biting on something to stem the agony and only realised it was his tongue when it had swelled. From time to time he would curse the fact that she had taken his right arm, and not his left, but the rest of the time he either howled in pain, or could not make a sound. From a slumped position in the bower of the Rhodendendren bush in which he had hidden himself, Barnaby rose as best he could, and walked worse. Bees could be heard in the crampt darkness. The night was clenched hot in the fingers of the twigs. 'Buzz,' the bees said. 'Buzz,' they repeated, as though they had nothing better to talk about. If Barnaby could have limped, he would have been pleased. Instead, he crawled and hobbled, and fell over, and then did it all again. It took him awhile to reach the girl who was holding his paw, and when he did, he saw she was far older than he had expected her to be. She walked in a daze. She felt rather like somebody who didn't believe in rabbits who had fallen down a rabbit hole. The trees, all of them like the one at the bottom of her garden (she didn't know its botanical name) had pods that whispered in the wind. After a long time, or so it seemed, of walking, they ceased this whispering and began to tinkle, like chandeliers caught in the wind. More than this, they were no longer yellow, but jaundiced white, the colour of urine in the snow, and her skin became pimpled and the same hue as the rhimed seeds. She could feel her nipples without touching them. Beneath her feet, the ground crackled as though she were walking on crisps. She didn't look down, just in case she was. She felt sure she was dreaming, but thought it looked far too real. She screwed up her eyes into a squint, balled her fists and kept walking, doing her level best not to suspend disbelief. She needed a lack of belief, as she did back in her own world, more than anything else. There was the tiniest of fairy-tale tinkles as a breeze passed through this section of the forest, collecting motes of snow and crystals and flurrying them before her sight. She absolutely refused to refer to them, internally, as fairy dust. The boughs of the trees appeared to be painted with ice, but she didn't look at them, and certainly did not peer. Instead, she stared straight ahead, and walked, and did not see the large, brown, kneeling bear. It was bleeding. It was watching her with the same disbelief that she wore. The blood from his wounds was slowing in the cold of the Northern Wood. Barnaby was as close to the domain of the Witch as he would normally dare to go. The pimples on his hide, beneath his pelt, goosed, not with cold, but with", "label": 1}
{"text": "fear. Whoever this woman was (and for some reason he recognised her), however she had come across Amy's teddy bear, she had blundered into a place she didn't understand, a dangerous realm, and had just kept on going North. He had to stop her but couldn't crawl fast enough and the dirks of ice that had been grass, and the daggers of ice that had been bushes, hurt him where he had been torn. The holly, glazed like Christmas cakes, was particularly painful. Barnaby slowed and raised his sight to see that she, whoever she was, had reached the resting place of the Witch. 'Stop' have to stop,' he said. The face swam in the block of ice before her but, at its depth, its expression was unfathomable. It had smooth skin, or perhaps it was the ice shearing it, and was small-headed, at the distance, and so had the look of a child that had fallen into a frozen lake. One arm rose, beautiful and cold and tapering, toward the surface of the ice block, seeming to seek her touch. 'I know you,' she said, and reached toward the hand. The face was familiar, she decided, in a part of her brain that could still do deciding. You're beautiful, she managed to think. She slouched onto the block of ice. It was warm on her palms as a prostrate body, and on the the underneaths of her elbows. It didn't feel cold at all. It felt like it was breathing' or beating' She reached forward and down. The ice parted, and her hand and that of the Witch met. The Witch's fingers twitched. There was the crunching sound of a heavy body crashing through the lines of iced trees behind her, but she slumped fully against the block, cutting her head. She collapsed down the side of it, her left temple bleeding. By the time the woman had settled on the eiderdown of the snow, she had fallen unconscious. The droplet of blood that had left her head infused the ice-block, colouring it crimson, and the white lines of the Witch's lips rouged and curved into a smile, and parted with one, long juddering breath. Barnaby didn't know the dark-haired woman, had no way of knowing what she did to a little girl in the Other Place, and so tried to save her. He staggered to the block, grasped her, and dragged her away. The dragging was an exhurberence he could have done without. He only needed to hold her hand (she was already fading from This Place) but he had forgotten this. It was then that he heard the sound of the Witch's cackle, as the ice block in which she had slept began to melt. The laughter bubbled up through the crystalline water as maggots do through the chilled skin of an exposed corpse. The bear, against the odds of his broken body, ran. The suspended silence of the North Wood spread out across the Latter Wood. The Laburnum pods, where they whispered together in the breeze, stilled, and held the wind, cupped. Small things, in their bowers, and in the nooks and niches down by the many rivulets, stopped their digging, momentarily, before resuming and noticing, as they did so, that the earth felt chiller on their paws than it had before. The dying light of one star, in the constellated night, reached the heavens in a burst unseen by any human eyes. It eclipsed that of the stars about it as it puckered up in one, rosy red, bee-stung kiss, and then was sucked in, becoming infitnitely smaller than an eye could see, if it were looking. That super nova was the Wishing star. Somehow, in their places about it, the Needing and the Wanting stars now looked forlorn. Somewhere, in a Day School in Another Place entirely, a little girl felt a shiver go through her skin ' not so much as though someone had walked over her grave, but as though they had stopped, unshouldered a shovel, and started to dig. She opened her eyes, pulled herself to her knees, picked up the teddy bear by the ear of his round, fat head, and rose. She would sell the bloody thing. She didn't decide this, as there was nothing left in her brain to do so, but she would, for the money. The money was important. It itched at her as to why, as an insect does at the skin, but she knew it was. Car Boot Sale, she thought, automatically, for no particular reason other than she often thought this, when she thought about money, and left the bedroom, and went down the green-carpeted stairs, carrying the bear by its remaining arm, and not by its paw. That afternoon, Amy was at school, and she was speaking. 'Yes, Barnaby, we did it,' said Amy. She said it again, louder, dancing about in a circle, as though nailed to the playground, 'We did it Barnaby. He's safe.' 'She's crazy. Crazy Amy has an imaginary friend.' Lucy giggled, high pitched enough to cut through Amy's daydream. Lucy, as ever, wasn't alone, and her friends laughed with her. The cut the girls' laughter made healed quickly, though, and Amy dancing away. She didn't care, not today; today everything was better. Afer the whistle, at line-up time, Mr Hymn, his hair thinning as his eyes did, these days, told her off. Amy was still dancing. Even he, however, shook his head, worn down by her constant smiling. 'Off with the faeries,' Mrs Skinner could be heard to say. Aidan was, and that's the only caring Amy could find herself doing. She smiled at Mr Hymn, as she walked by, in the line, and, when she was inside and out of his sight, she danced some more. During Golden Time, she drew flowers and butterflies and worms, all of them wearing wide, crayon smiles. It wasn't until after she'd finished scribbling, that she realised she had also", "label": 1}
{"text": "drawn a little boy with big, luminous wings. An angel. The angel had an upside down 'u' for a mouth, and a frown for a face. 'My baby would love this,' said the woman. She was pregnant and stood, brunette-topped and half a head taller than the man who turned to her. His hands widened with his mouth. 'It's only got one arm,' he said. 'Yeah, but it's a proper old teddy bear. Look, smell it.' The man did so. He was thin and his round glasses had the appearance of being the widest part of him. His eyelids tightened as he sniffed, then relaxed, as though seeing something he hadn't seen, for a long time. 'It smells of childhood,' he said. He had a southern accent. 'Aye,' said the brunette, who did not. 'It smells of happy children.' Amy glowered at her. Her fists were balled beneath the table Chris had taken out of the garage. On its surface a sign said 'Car Boot Sale'. It was a school evening and she sat in her uniform. 'How much is this, pet?' the woman said. Amy did not reply. 'Don't mind the bairn. She loves that old thing. God knows why.' Her Mam smiled. 'That'll be fifty p, love.' The man looked at Amy, shifted to his right foot, and put his hands in his pocket. 'Well, if you love it pet, why don't you keep it, instead?' said the woman. 'Bairn's gotta grow up, eh?' said Amy's Mam. She looked at the teddy in the woman's grip and her sentences shortened. 'Fifty p, please.' The sun came out from behind a skyscape of white clouds and disappeared again. The sky looked like it had snowed upward. The woman's hand went toward the table. Amy thought she was about to replace the bear, but it went away again. Her other palm fell on her belly, and gripped its crest, rubbing it in a slow, sun-shaped motion. 'Tony!' she said. The man grimaced, and then the bumps of his fingers could be seen, knuckling beneath the denim pockets of his jeans. He retrieved a pound coin and said, 'Keep the change, love,' sounding more southern than he had before. 'Thank-you. Say thank-you, pet,' her Mam said to Amy. Amy didn't, but mumbled two syllables that rhymed with it. The man stared sharply at her from within the rounded rims of his glasses but her Mam didn't notice. She wasn't all there, this afternoon. They left, the woman carrying Barney as though she no longer wanted him. Amy and her mother sat in silence. No one else came and the clouds darkened as though the white sky had turned to slush, and it began to rain. They packed away in silence, but for her Mam telling her what to do and where to put it. When they went inside and out of the rain, Amy could no longer keep in the tears, and started to cry. She curled up in the corner of the sofa and her mother shouted at her, her beautiful face contorting in confused rage. She didn't seem to remember why Amy was upset. Amy continued to weep, she just didn't show it, on the outside. Her mother collapsed on a chair beside the round, wooden table, in the kitchen, letting her head fall into her arms. 'Jesus, pet, you are screwed up,' she said, to the inside of her arms. There was a knock at the door and her Mam's head jerked, her eyelids snarling open. 'Oh, can't you all just leave me alone,' she shouted. Amy had forgotten she was crying and shrank into the settee's skin-coloured covering. The knock came again. 'Get the bloody door, then,' her Mam said, letting her head sink back down to her elbows. Amy didn't move and her mother's left eye came back up above her elbow joint, like a dragon staring through a hole in a mountain-side. Amy rolled off the sofa and went to the door, opening it. The brunette, pregnant woman turned. She was halfway down the path, the spectacled man pulling her toward the front gate. In her other hand she held Barney. She let go of the man, and walked back to the step Amy stood on. The woman lifted the bear to her and smiling and running her spare hand in soft circles on her belly, said, 'Here,' she spoke in a whisper. 'It's your teddy bear, isn't it?' Amy nodded. 'It's yours,' the woman repeated and pushed it into the little girl's somnabulent grip. The teddy bear appeared to be smiling. When Amy took him, he felt happy. 'Come on,' said the man. His glasses glinted as the sun re-emerged and he glanced about. 'We've got to go,' she said. Please don't, Amy thought to say, but they were already at the gate. Look after your baby, she thought to add, but they were walking down the pavement. The man's glasses were fixed ahead. The little girl walked into the house and closed the door. After the soft click of its closing, there was silence. Amy went up the stairs to the bedroom and replaced Barney, careful to wedge him so that he would not be visible, under the bed. They were playing cards, as they did every Thursday, around the small, worn wooden table in the kitchen. Uncle Freddie, Mam, Grandma, and Uncle John, who was on leave from the army. Amy liked her uncles, they would ruffle her hair, say 'the bairns growing all the time' and swear as though both of them were bloody troopers, or so Grandma said. Uncle Freddie would show her rude and funny things on the computer and then laugh as she covered her eyes. But Amy felt safe whenever he was around, despite the fact that Mam said he'd been charged with 'attempted murder', when he was younger. (Amy had never understood this, as far as she could tell, you either murdered someone, or you didn't,", "label": 1}
{"text": "and the rest was just missing.) Sometimes, Amy joined in the card games, sometimes she didn't, and listened to the banter, and the carping around the round table. Mam wouldn't let Chris play anymore, as one time he had looked close to tears at the ribbing her brothers were giving him, and he watched films in the lounge. This time, Amy sat in the carpeted corner by the table and coloured the woods in her sketchbook, adding an entry next to The Latter Wood, about a character called the Christian, and listening to her Mam. 'Three of spades, slither under that if you can you jammy bastards,' she said. 'Ohhh, drawing out the lady, are you?' said John, whose accent was southerning from years away. 'Shite, you mean the cunt, reet?' said Freddie. Amy looked up from colouring in yellow. Freddie always sounded more Geordie when John was home, and would call the game Hunt the Cunt, while John would call it Chase the Lady. The woman in question was the queen of spades. 'Oh, who cares what she's called, just put the bloody cards down,' said Mam. 'Fuck you all,' said Freddie, as the queen came out. 'No, fuck you,' said John, placing the King of spades. 'Jesus, I can't believe I raised you two. Listen to your mouths. Disgusting,' said Granny, putting down the Jack of spades. She laughed. 'Take that.' 'And fucking party,' said John, collecting the cards with a grimace. His score was already a hundred more than the others. Grandma stared flints at him. 'I'm gonna walk away from the table, if you don't stop your potty mouth.' 'Sorry Mam,' John cocked his head, and smiled up at her. 'Pssh,' she said, 'just add that lot to your score and stop trying to charm an old lady. I've seen it all before.' Mam was quiet as this went on. She touched her eyes. 'Are you alright, love?' said Grandma. Mam smiled shortly, and it quicky disappeared. 'Just thinking about little Aidan.' Grandma' face crumpled delicately, like a bin liner pressed around a dead pet. 'I know, sweetheart, but there's nothing you can do. The doctors know best.' Amy kept her head down, and kept colouring in, in yellow. 'Aye,' said Freddie, 'keep yer mind on yer cards. Come on John, read 'em and weep.' Amy Chapter 2 IN WHICH AN ANGEL DOES THE RIGHT THING Angel looked upward. The bell tower that nestled on top of the computer suite of the Night school was tolling. It was the end of the second break before midnight. The children were coming in ' Angel could hear them; the sound of talking, the noise of teachers shouting at them to stop, the sound of talking, the noise of teachers being ignored. There was a teacher, however, who wasn't saying a word. As ever, Angel was where he shouldn't be, having claimed to Mrs Disdivanshumayl that he needed the toilet. Angel was outside the disabled toilet near the hall. Though it was occupied and he could not enter, he had no intention of going in, as his bladder had no intention of relieving itself in the next hour or so. Instead, he was watching Mr Him, not because he had promised Aimee that he would watch him, but because he had promised he would protect her baby brother, and Angel did not renegade on his promises. (Unless they were to a teacher, but promising a teacher was like Tower in Numeracy- it didn't count.) Mr Him walked by, looked at the toilet, grunted, and continued on his way. He was not alone. Angel, standing close by, pretended to be opening another child's lunchbox. He had found, across his time in schools, both Day and Night, that teachers never ignored you more than when they thought you were doing something wrong. This was particularly true when they were in a hurry, and Mr Him was in a hurry. The little boy with Mr Him was being just as quiet as the adult. Though only somewhere between seven and nine, Angel wouldn't have considered himself a little kid, and he wasn't, at least in comparisson with this one. The boy appeared to be from year one, and Angel was sure he could remember seeing him, sprinting up and down the corridor to the dining room, just after midnight snack. Normally, this boy was giggling, and, when he wasn't doing that he was gurgling, and when he wasn't gurgling, he was screaming. Angel had never seen him quiet. They walked, the three of them, two of them side by side, and Angel hidden behind, down to the stairs that led to Key Stage One, right, and from there to the Lower Playground. Angel glanced behind him. Neither Mr Him nor the smaller child did and all Angel could see of their heads was their hair and Mr Him's baldness. The first seemed to move more than the slight wind would have demanded. Mr Him had a hand on the child's grey-jumpered back, propelling him forward. The fingers on the fabric were splayed, crooked and still, as though glued. Half of the Key Stage One playground was a willow garden, its pathways made of tunnels of bent and woven willows, hung through with fairy lights. The globes of the street lamps that lit the playground were, here, scratched out by the lengths of willow, and the twinkling of the fairy lights were all that now lit Angel's way. He followed them in. He lost Mr Him in the dark. They'll be looking for me, he thought, meaning Mrs Disdivanshumayl's eyes. It was long after break. The thought occurred to him that Mr Him must have known he was following, had stopped, was lying in wait. A man who made Angel think of tweed and failure abruptly took on sharp edges, like being hit by a quiet father, for the first time. Angel looked behind him again. And to the sides. He didn't really", "label": 1}
{"text": "like the dark ' it reminded him of the home he had escaped, to come here. The Witch's moon was up, but was shrouded by the leaves that adorned the willow-weaving here, nearer the centre of the garden. His feet wanted to turn around, his toes went further, and wanted, desperately, to flee. He could feel them, itching, but he had made a promise; and to a child. Gripping his fingers into fists, and his courage between them, he walked forward, the blue fairy lights making the way seem to be a tunnel delved in ice, or a substance made of the same fabric as his freezing heart. He could see the breath infront of his face, but little else until the vaguest of breezes touched his cheeks and a dull, rotten oval of light could be glimpsed, ahead, through the foliage. The middle of the willow garden, thought Angel. He edged closer to the falling light of the moon. The end of the willow tunnel was a putrid full stop, just ahead. His heart thudded, seeming to pause on every beat, waiting for something. He expected, at every second, to see the tunnel's end to be smudged out by the ink of Mr Him's silhouette. He didn't. Angel reached the glade, and crouched. (The nearer to the ground his bottom got, the more he wanted the toilet. This feeling reminded Angel of his father, and especially the times he asked, 'You gonna shit yourself, you little shit?'. The circles of willow seemed to tighten around his head and Angel found he couldn't even gulp.) The midst of the willow garden held a pagoda and a pond and, them, nothing else. Where are you? thought Angel to himself, meaning both Mr Him and the boy. He stepped out into the light of the witch's moon, which was less bright now that he was within it. The pond surface was threaded with grass, and bubbled by frogspawn, which shivered slightly, like jelly on a plate. The pagoda was slats of silhouette-black and no sign of occupation. 'Gone,' whispered Angel. It felt reassuring to hear a part of himself- his lips- that wasn't his heart, or the veins at his temples. (What he hadn't seen because it was behind not one willow shoot, but many, was the sight of Mr Him holding the hand of a four year old child and leading him into a pond. He had missed the sight of water quickly swamping the boy's tiny black leather school shoes, that were just a clot or two of mud, the frogspawn flooding his white school shirt, until it may as well have never been clean, and the grass obscuring his face entirely, as though he had never had a personality. He didn't see them both, step-by-step wading into the pond, until they had disappeared.) Barney sat in the midst of the ruffled duvet looking for all this particular world like a bear going down in a cotton storm. His one remaining arm was raised slightly, at the angle at which he sat, as though holding onto the air, when he was already going under. The scene, the blue wall behind him, the white door, ran all to the shape and consistentcy of Amy's tears, which fell freely, making a damp patch on her bed. She kept saying something, which may have been 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry' but couldn't have been because it was entirely incomperehensible. She gulped snot. She wiped gunge onto her jammies. Amy raised her own arm, the opposite to that of his. She let it fall. She tried again- to reach out to him- and let it fall. The waves of duvet were insurmountable, as much as her guilt. She swallowed, saying, 'I'm sorry,' and raised her arm and reached for Barney, and didn't let it drop, and, soon enough, she was falling. Looking up at the night sky, Aimee realised that, here, the moon did not wane, but only waxed. It should now be the time- calenderwise- of the half moon, or the sickle. Its coverage, indicated, instead, that this was a one-and-a-half moon. Again, with the slap of cold air to her cheeks, Aimee was reminded that, by bringing her brother here, she had broken the rules of This Place, marred nature, rearranged the order of things in the samw way as Angel would say, 'I'll rearrange your face.' She brushed aside thought of Angel, as thoughts of Angel meant thoughts of the one he was protecting- her baby brother. It wasn't that she didn't want to think of him, it was that she already did, and those thoughts were big and luminous and sky-filling as the Witch's moon, and she couldn't afford them to wax or she thought she would split her face open, and she would cry again. There was movement under the treeline of the Laburnums, but it was slow and heavy, and Aimee knew it could not be her bear. She hunkered down between the long fingers of the overgrown grass in the glade. It was wet beneath her red-shoed feet, and lapped mud against her sock-line, and she guessed it had been raining. The wet was turning, in places, already to frost, and the breath from her mouth was cloudy as the release of a genie. Heart thrumming, she pressed her face to her ruffed shoulder, trying to douse its smoke signals. She didn't want whatever was put there to be alerted to her position. If it wasn't Barnaby, and it was big (and it sounded big) it must be a minion of the witch. She glanced again at the sky, for some sign of the Honey Pot, or the Wishing or the Needding, or the Wanting stars, or just some sign. She spotted nothing, but the blanched, crated features of the moon itself. She had never looked at them before and not noticed that its pocks could be read as a sharp-toothed grin. She decided not to", "label": 1}
{"text": "look much now, either, but couldn't shy from the noise of breaking vegetation and hacked breathing, and she knew that the thing in the night was closing. 'Barnaby, I'm sorry. Where are you Baranby?' She bent lower against the mud, careful not to touch any of the tendrils of green and yellow grass. The smoke signals that rose from her mouth were lessening now, but only because her throat was tightening, or was it because her heart did the same. She wondered momentarily if breathing came from the heart, before recalling the anatomy lessons of Mrs Her, and having cut open the lungs of the pig. (It had complained throughout this procedure, at least until both lungs had been punctuared.) Still she caged the emissions of her lips, little good that did. The noise of the glade's transgresor was coming ever closer. It breathed as no creature had any right to do so, in long wet exhalations, and fast, snakish hisses of inhalation. Whatever it was, in that it didn't sound as though it were supposed to be alive. This made Aimee think about rising and running. But to do so, would be to invite it upon her. The bear knew this spot. He would come. If she ran, she would have nothing to fight for her. But, if she stayed, it would close, as it did now, and not only close, but touch her, with whatever it had for arms. Aimee tried to put this out of her mind, but could do little to dispel the images of fangs and tentacles and claws. When it came, she discovered she was half right. It had fangs, and one paw of claws, but the other was missing, and, in its stead, there was the smell of blood and broken fur. 'Barnaby,' she breathed, in relief. The bear made a sound in its throat which may have been 'Aimee' or it may have been vomiting, the girl could not tell because the bear had collapsed at her shoes. 'Barnaby!' she repeated. She crouched to the earth. Her hands and palms and fingers found his fur, cradling it where she could, but her thoughts found him more often. Her guilt blanketed him. How could she have been so cruel? After tearing him, how could she make him crawl out there? Why couldn't she leave the poor bear alone? Amy did not put any of these questions into words; not even inside her own mind; she was too young to do so, perhaps. But she could articulate their answer; Aidan, she thought. 'I'm sorry,' she said, though her tongue felt swollen and putrid, as though sick of saying the same two words. She cradled him in her small arms, and raised his snout and head (which was now unconscious, from the effort of the movement she had demanded of him, quite probably) onto her lap. She stroked him and cried onto the tuft of his forehead. It was matted and not at all looked after, as was the rest of his pelt. His pride, it seemed, had gone the way of his bloodloss. Aimee considered dragging him back to the treeline, where he would be covered by shadow, and have more of a chance to rest- to heal. But she knew she didn't have the strength, and wouldn't, even if she had been a full grown woman. So, she gently lowered his head into the soft mulsh between the foilage, and collected arms-full of grass, and built him, sheaf by sheaf, a hut, as low-lying as his frame. It was all she could do. 'Won't help if the wolf comes to blow it down,' she said, her head giddy from exertion and from the hour, by the time she was finished. Dawn was visible beyond the wall of the Latter Wood. 'Sleep well, bear,' she kissed his snout. 'I won't bother you again.' She didn't apologise, figuring he would have heard enough of this, even when unconscious. 'Until you are healed. Find somewhere safe.' With this she reached below the skein of interwoven grasses, found his paw, and took it. The dark branches were wet with rain and, in the lantern lights of the small five-child party, appeared to be snakes newly shed from their skin, eager, slicked, malicious. Tower's heart fluttered, somewhere between scared and excited, its thump-thump unable to settle on either. He didn't know what it was to be indifferent as much as he didn't know whsat it was to be cool. His hair, the way his clothes hung to the swollen front porch of his gut, his gait, and its endless swaying between left and right. He couldn't do easy. His fingers misbehaved when he drank tea, and he spilt it. His eyes couldn't look you in the eye. Tonight, in the Latter Wood, the dribbles of water seemed to have totured everything else into silence. The Christain had come to Tower's lesson (with Mrs Her as Mr Him had planning and preparation time, and so was not with his children) and asked for five children. Because, Tower was sure; Mrs Her did not like his tourette-ish twitching, the way he would put his hand up at every question, but by the time she was forced to pick him, would say 'I've forgotten' until she just rolled her eyes, and said, 'What a surprise' in a growl into her beard. Because of this, she had chosen him, amongst the group of three from her class, to go with the two from the other class in Year Three. 'Ah, ah,' said the Christian, crossing himself as he often did (before they had keft the school he had faced East, bent, kneeled and prayed to Allah for at east five minutes, on a small rug), 'Watch out for the'' Tower missed what he was supposed to be looking out for. Back in the school, and one the walkway down to the high, convulated front gates it had been cracks in the pavement,", "label": 1}
{"text": "which the Christian had obviously taken to be unlucky. Here it may have been a single magpie, or a meeting branches in the form of the Buddha, or some such oddity of fate and chance. Tower ignored the Christian. He had enough to worry about, and that was just his normal stride. He had tripped and fallen five times, and his face was covered in muck, and his mouth had the taste of mud. 'Stop here,' said the Christian. Not, it seeemd, because the ground was favourable for the planting of the potato seeds they carried, but because the two nearest Laburnum trees were arranged (due to the collapsing of one) into the figure seven. 'Who's got the trowels,' said the Christian. It was difficult to tell, in the dark, until Tower turned his lantern on the group. (He was one of two of the children who had been tasked with the job of light carrying. A very important job in the coal-edifice of the Latter Wood, at night, when the witch's Moon was eclipsed by a celebration of Laburnum seeds and branches. Also, a very easy job, and one where the Christian could easily see if Tower had dropped the lantern, or otherwise left it behind.) It turned out, via the medium of light, that the Christian had forgotten to give any of the children the trowels. 'Oh, bugger,' said the Christian. 'Oh, the bad number,' the Christian added, as he double-checked his lack of equipment. 'Help,' he said, finally. Except he said it in a child's voice. Tower stared at him. The lantern to the right of his right temple cast the Christian in halos of light, and gave him, momentarily, a halo of his own. 'Help me!' said the Christian, in his child-voice. Except, through the use of looking, Tower could tell it wasn't the Christian who had spoken. His lips hadn't shifted. Here was a slight wind in the forest and it touched Tower's cheek, which shook like the syllables of a stammerer before they came out. 'S-sir?' he asked, sticking up his hand. The Christian ignored it. He had more pressing worries, it appeared, those being- trowels. Tower twisted his hand. 'Sir?' he repeated. 'Please' anybody'' the child's voice was raised again. It had a ghost-like quality, borne on the wind as it was, its tone shorn of any power by the elements. Tower staggered slightly to the side, as though drawn to it. He felt quite unable to stop himself. 'He's taking me away. He keeps touching me. Please make him stop.' 'Um?' said the Christian. 'Um?' he asked, again. 'Where are you going, Tower?' But Tower wasn't listening or, at least, if he was listening, he wasn't listening to him. Tower's feet, almost of their own accord, stumbled into a job, and then a run. 'Where is he taking me?' the wind seemed to ask. But, if it was the wind, it was a young wind, and a scared one. Tower, darted from treeline to treeeline, past bushes. The darkness around the ring of his lantern light took on a new meaning, like that of swear words to a child that was beginning to understand them. It shifted, without actually moving at all. But Tower, despite the cowardliness of his demeanor, didn't stop. His run became more of sprint. The wind was moving, and away from him, carrying the words on it in snippets. 'Help' Please 'It's'. Him'. Stop' Him'.. Help,' it said. The terrain was hardening before his feet. The soles went this way and that, as they always did, but, no matter where they trod, they stepped on frost. The Laburnum leaves and pods, occasionally, when Tower was more concerned with following the voice than his own eye-line, cut across his face like the angry buzz of wasps. The air felt sharp as ice, hard as metal daggers. His skin and blood were hotter than before, at least at his cheeks, as it rose to combat the lowering temperature, which Tower did not notice, because all he heard, in a voice not many years dissimilar from his own, was , 'Help!.. Me!' And then Tower, suddenly, stopped. And then Tower, suddenly, saw where he was, and everything around him. It was one of those moments of clarity only available in a frozen forest where nothing moved bar the thing that you hoped never ever to see. A thing so heart rending it reminded Tower - and most forcibly- of bedtime, and why he as here, in this world, at all. Tower tried to scream but all that came out of his mouth was the vapour of his breathing and he turned and ran in the opposite direction, in as straight a line as he had ever managed. They stood in the Key Stage Two playground ' Tower and Angel and Sunshine ' below a lamppost that must have been of Victorian descent. It looked like it needed a blue police box and a red post box, to complete the set. 'A village? Are you sure?' asked Angel. His face carried his usual expression, in the same way as a mediavel peasant may have been described as a carrier of the pox. 'He's said so three times already,' said Sunshine, in her most pleasant voice, which was more reminiscent of tuberculosis. Her nose ran, as it always did, in Winter, Spring, and Summer terms. (Autumn seemed to suit Sunshine, perhaps because it was the cloudiest season in the Latter Wood.) 'Y-yes,' said Tower. 'Full of children? Children that have gone missing from this school?' Tower nodded. He didn't trust himself to talk- stammer and all- but his nod went several directions at pretty much the same time, and could well have been a shake. 'Mr Him,' repeated Angel. He had said this since the beginning of the conversation. 'Mr Him'' 'You said that'' said Sunshine. '' before.' Angel ignored her. (He had been taught, by his quiet father, to ignore women, especially", "label": 1}
{"text": "as they did when she asked Mr Hymn to go to the toilet, to make the teacher think she was desperate. She was distracted. The aliens were anaemic, misted by the saline in which they hung, but vague in the way of Amy's memories. They twitched, in the same manner, from deep below the surface. An actor pushed his wide, cartoonish face toward the glass of the jar. The alien spurted toward him, quick as bodily fluids, liquid as intimacy, all folds of skin and pinks and beiges and plump ridges of flesh. It tried to lime onto his face, greasing against the sheer glass. 'Gonna get a beer,' said Uncle Chris, rising. Left alone, Amy hugged her teddy bear tight enough to feel its innards pressing against hers. She didn't notice their feel, taking in nothing but the look of the alien's soft and pink flesh under its skin-ish flaps. Instinctively, she reached for Barney's paw. 'What the Hell?' screamed Ripley. She was bigger than Aimee remembered, and three-d. Lieutenent Ripley smelt of sweat and terror. There was a skittering sound. Aimee had turned before she realised she was standing up, and no longer sitting on a peach settee. Her shoed feet squeaked on the polished, saline-puddled floor. Aimee looked down. A pair of red shoes stared back. The toes of them gleamed maliciously. The right one seemed to wink. She looked away, disconcerted. To the side of her, with all the awkwardness of an elephant in the room, stood a large, brown bear. 'What the Hell?' screamed Ripley. 'A bear?' She looked like she wished she had a gun. The skittering was closing. 'Girl,' said the bear. He extended a paw. Aimee reached out. She turned her head but left the shoes facing the way they had been. A pale form, the colour of mucus and looking like saliva on the move, sprang toward her head. A proboscis shot toward her open mouth, slicked even before it reached her small, rose lips. In a spurt of terror and shock, her bladder opened. Aimee's hand closed on the paw and she was back on the sofa, in her pyjamas. She bit the insides of her cheeks until they bled. Her thighs were wet. 'Ewww, nasty aliens, man.' There was laughter - not on the film, but from Chris. He returned to the room as Amy did from the film. The little girl's legs had stilled, as though she no longer needed the toilet. As he sat, Uncle Chris stopped laughing. 'Jesus, bairn, why did you go and do that?' he said. Amy stared at Uncle Chris. His lips were moving. They were less viscid than those of the alien, and seemed unreal. 'Get up. Get up. Your Mam will be home soon.' He was up, even if she wasn't. 'Get some hot water on a bloody cloth, and some washing-up liquid. For shit's sake, wake up and get a shift on, girl.' There was anger there or, perhaps, fear. 'Put the bloody bear down!' He grabbed Barnaby and threw the teddy across the room. Barney rolled to a broken stop below the sweeping, fake-tone fireplace, and lay staring at them with thick, black eyes. Chris wrenched her up. She noticed the settee-cushion was wet as she left it. It was darkened all over, a peach that had not so much been bruised as thoroughly beaten. Chris's hand was rough on her wrist, but did not stay there. He left and returned, dripping blue cloth from his hand in a stalactite, and soap-whitened water from that. 'Bloody hell, child, I'll do it then.' Chris glared at her. He knelt and scrubbed at the urine on the cushion cover. 'Go on and wash yourself off. Christ.' Amy walked away, legs stiff and apart as a stickman that had soiled itself . Her head was a round hollow. It was times like these that she wouldn't remember, later. She grabbed Barney, walked to the door, and crabbed up the stairs, to the bathroom. As she climbed, Amy heard Chris swearing and the exasperated spray of an air-freshener. Amy could hear it until she turned on the tap. The bathroom was a cream that had mortified to grey, decorated in a wallpaper of small pale roses, like the pages of a vast, flower-pressing sketchbook. It smelt slightly of faeces and of damp. She stripped, ran the cold water, not the hot, and washed between her legs, her lower belly, and her crotch. She soaked her pyjamas, then wrung them like a line of rolled skin. Amy took them out of the bathroom and to her mother's room. She always tiptoed on this carpet. She stopped in front of the dresser that was a cleft between the ceiling-high mirrors that her mother used to dress herself and stare into. On the dresser's surface stood a wooden, Russian Doll. Inside that, Amy knew, stood another. She didn't like the Russian Dolls. They were smiling but their eyes were blank, and that made the smiles seem false. She opened the dresser's top draw, took her Mam's hairdryer, plugged it in, blow-dried the pink cloth, put away the hairdryer, put the pyjamas back on and went to bed. They were still a little wet and she lay shivering, as if scared. Amy's life was her room at night. Her days felt vague, disembodied; the product of an over-active imagination. In the night, orange came in by the window, outlining the desk by the blinds, the Argos cupboard, and the blinds themselves, beyond which it outlined the city, the roofs and the tower blocks, as if the cityscape was trapped in the centre of a gigantic wine gum. Somebody in the streets below was shouting 'new-ca-stle, new-ca-stle'. At the foot of Amy's bed, care-bears formed the edging of stormclouds - lit from the side by the colour of the landing light, where it shafted into the room. Amy had left the door closed, to discourage her Mam. Her", "label": 1}
{"text": "the ones who felt at liberty to give their opinions' He had been taught more than that, in all honesty, but didn't attempt his to pass his teachings onto Sunshine, for fear she would hit him back.) 'We have to stop Mr Him getting to him,' he said. The other two children nodded, solemnly. They both knew the him he meant; Aimee's baby brother; Aidan. 'I guess now it's time for me to give up,' sang Amy, softly enough to be heard by her white, wooden , bedroom door, but not by the landing, outside it. She was unaware that most children in her position would have given up long ago. She had been staring out of her window at the wine-gum sunset, and Newcastle's lights below it - arranged into the outline of hills. Her eyes dropped from this, as she murmured, along with Gary Barlow on the tape-player, 'Got your picture here beside me''. Her eyesight fell through the park, past the swings and the cookie-dough, bouncy asphalt the council had baked the ground in, and, finally, looked to her left, to the picture on her wall. Before this track, she had been singing Never Forget, and, though she had to sing it nearly silently, her throat was rubbed raw, and her eyes looked redder. She was sure she wouldn't forget. That she couldn't stop thinking about Aidan. It never occurred to Amy that she might remember the things that had happened to her. The picture she now stared at, on her wall, was one of a set of three, but her Mam had sold the other two, in various Car Boot sales. It was of a hill, and a lamp-post upon it, and lights hung from its bulb, making it appear Christmasy. (With 'Fairy Lights No.3' written below the painting, itself, in a ghostly shade of grey.) Amy was unsure what the picture was painted in, but the colouring had a grey and blue ethereal quality, almost as though it were not there at all, and that explained, to Amy's mind, why her Mam had missed it on her many Car Boot clearouts. Accidentally switching back to the song before, Amy mumbled, 'Never forget where you're coming from. Never pretend it's all for real'' There was movement in the picture. Amy blinked. 'Back For Good' was still playing, but Amy ws straining to hear speech. In the foreground of the picture, there were three children under that light. They were talking. One of them looked as solid as a tall building, another wore angel wings, and the third shone out of the canvas like a star. (Amy was unsure which one- maybe the Needing.) 'We've come so far, and we've raised so high,' whispered Amy, still on the wrong song. 'And we've looked each day and night in the eye. And we're still so young , and we hope for more'' 'Please ignore the monster at the back of the classroom,' said Mr Him. This was proving troublesome for most of the class, but not for Angel, who couldn't take his eyes off Mr Him. 'What did I say, Brains ' eyes to me!... Both of them, please!' Looking at Mr Him, Angel could concentrate on the way he glanced at the children. Behind his glasses, his eyes were that of a frog seeing a fly. Though he focused on the teacher, Angel could hear the crate at the back of the room shifting and bellowing, or more specifically, the thing within it. 'Any guesses, children, as to what is in the box?' Mr Him rubbed his hands together. Angel could have sworn they had left slime behind- they glistened. Angel put up his own hand. 'Mmmmn?' said Mr Him. 'Gorrila of the Witch,' said Angel. The face of the teacher fell around his glasses which, rigid, seemed, like scaffolding, to be the only thing keeping the fa'ade up. 'Well, yes,' Mr Him agreed. His gaze hung to Angel, for a moment, then moved on ' to linger on a little girl's face, or so Angel reckoned. In his crossed legs, his tiny fingers knitted. 'Today's lesson,' continued Mr Him, 'is Death. How to die in This Place'' He walked behind the carpeted area of the classroom and the pupil's heads followed him, owlishly, on top of their shoulders. Death had caught their attention. The back of the classroom was a space cleared of its normal, orange-topped tables. In the centre of the puce floor stood a dark-coloured crate which shifted and trembled, to breaths of the gorilla within it. 'Science! I know- so boring, most of the time. Thermometers and weighing scales and yawns, yawns, yawns' But this time, you get a chance to feel what death feels like, in this world. Any volunteers?' No hands went up. Not even those of the girls who sat along the carpet's front row. Now Mr Him was holding a length of string. 'Oh, come on! It's only a little winged monkey.' The crate careened about the floor as whatever was inside took exception to this description, and bellowed. 'Come on, it's not dangerous. Perfectly safe! I'll just let the gorilla hit you until you die. Look, I'll keep this'' He twitched the string like a marionette chord. '' tied to you and pull you out, when you've lost enough blood. All that will happen is you'll pass out of this world and wake in your beds in the other. So' volunteers, then?' Mr Him had wandered to the front of the room, again, and was a sweaty stain of an adult across the middle of the whiteboard. 'Just a little monkey' Little winged monkey. I'll have to pick someone'' Every one of the children's hand's could well have been rooted in the carpet. There was the distinctive sound of people holding their breaths. Mr Him crouched infront of Sunshine, whom he often smiled at. He put his hand on her shoulder, and Angel felt his stomach do something", "label": 1}
{"text": "strange- something adults did with pancakes on Shrove Tuesday. 'Come on, Sunshine,' he said. He smiled at her. His eyes were wider, having come alive in such close proximity to one of his favourite children. Angel put his hand up. 'You trust me, don't you sweat heart?' Mr Him kneaded her shoulder. 'Angel put his huh-hand up,' blurted Tower. Mr Him's upper lip twitched as he let go of Sunshine and rose to stand. His eyes had gone back to their normal dull, pebblish deadness, behind their lenses. 'Brave boy,' he hissed. 'Showing the class how much of a big boy you are, eh, Angel?' Angel stared back. He didn't speak. He was determined not to swear at Mr Him. Mr Him smiled as he tied the length of string to himself and then said; 'Stand up, boy.' Angel did so and Mr Him tied the other end around his belly. (Angel breathed in, so that his stomach-skin did not touch his school shirt.) 'Now,' said the teacher. 'This will be painful, I'm afraid. A little bit of advice, if I may. It will be tempting to try to move as quickly as you can, inside the crate, because the gorillas are strong, but they're slow. I would say- don't. You may as well take the beating, and you'll be dead quicker.' Take the beating, Angel could hear his father teling him, in his head. (Though he didn't need to be told; the beatings he could take- they were easy.) Angel licked his lips which felt surprisingly dry beneath the bottom of his tongue, and Mr Him led him to the back of the classroom. Now, the teacher was whispering. 'There's a small door on the other side of the crate. Big enough for a human but not for the Gorilla. I'll push you in, wham bang, thank you Maam.' The last seemd to be for Angel's ears only. There was a look in Mr Him's eyes that suggested he was thinking about all the times Angel had misbehaved. Angel smiled his most beautific smile, and said, loudly; 'It'll be okay, Mr Him. Don't you worry about me.' 'I'm not,' whispered Mr Him, and swung open a small, magonohy coloured door, and hefted Angel in. Inside, the crate smelt of faeces and was black as the underarm of an ape, until Angel realised that was what he was staring at. The Gorilla's extensive wings made his underarms even bigger. Then, the gorilla turned and bared not only his fangs, but a monstrous set of biceps. His wings shook in the confined space like the circles inside speakers, when they were on full blast. It bellowed and Angel felt his hairline waft, and his nostrils wither. Angel rolled around the Gorilla as it sprung. The crate skitered to the side, scraping across the polished floor. The classroom outside screamed and Mr Him shouted, 'Don't fight it. Make it quick.' Angel had rolled around the torso of the Witch's minion, and was tangled about its upper right leg. With a Huff and a snarl, the thing turned to bite at him but, in the dark, missed. He couldn't smell him, Angel realised, because of its own stench. He slipped a finger inside the knot of his string and untied it. Then, the gorilla seized him about the waist and began to pull. Wind knocked from his body, stars made light inside the crate, but a fake one, and Angel had to make a point of all of his reminaing consciousness to re-tie the string, which had now completely encircled the beast. With a wriggle, he freed his right arm and pulled insistently at the rope. Mr Him, at the other end, and unseen by Angel, tugged back. 'Hummmnn?' the Gorrilla asked. His grip eased on Angel enough for the boy to play dead but continue to breathe. It took all of his willpower not to weeze. Mr Him tugged again. Now that his sight had tuned itself to the pitch black, Angel could see the rough length of string, and the ape pinching it with two fingers, curiously wrapping its entire hand around it. The hand, thought Angel, was about the size of a tyre. He reckoned its punch would be like being hit by a truck Angel could hear Mr Him saying, 'We'll leave him in there a little longer, shall we class? All the better for this experiment.' Then, Mr Him gave the string a tiny mocking tug. The gorilla wrenched back and there was the sound of Mr Him hitting the side of the crate. 'Agrhmm,' Mr Him could be heard, saying. The Gorilla pulled again and wrenched Mr Him into the crate, or, at least, just his head, which the gorilla punched. Blood splatted on the crate's straw. 'Arggggghhhhhh,' screamed Mr Him, his voice slightly muffled by shock. As the Gorilla pulled the rest of Mr Him's body into the darkness, and continued to pound it, Angel crawled out of the crate and lay, smiling on the polished, slightly sctracthed floor of Class 7. 'Ask him!' said Angel. He stood, his expression balled up as a clenched fist on the top of a straight arm. The Headmistress would have thought he was about to cry, if his eyes were not so defiant. 'Ask him!' the boy repeated. 'Tower saw it all. Where he's taking the children. That's why I let the Gorilla have him. He's kidnapping little kids!' The headmistress ' an owl which wore horn-rimmed glasses and, quite often in the winter, cardigans, leant back. Her eyes blinkd in shock which, given the size of them, was tantamount to saying; her face blinked in shock. 'That's an awfully' serious accusation, Angel!' 'It's true!' 'Well, I mean' I'll have to talk to your guardian. It's the snake, isn't it?' Angel didn't answer this but said, spittle falling, seemingly accidentally, out of his lips. 'How could you let him teach here?' 'That's enough, now, Angel.' She was flustered and", "label": 1}
{"text": "her feathers stood on end. 'Go back to class.' The child did so and the Headmistress leant back into her leather chair (made from the hides of countless mice). Eventually she flapped, rose and flew to the reception. 'Could you get Mr Him for me, please?' she asked. Mr Him stood before the Headmistress. She stared at him, and tried not to notice how sweaty he was. (The bruises, hwoever, were impossible to ignore.) 'It's a serious accusation,' she said, after the teacher did not reply. 'You know that's in my past. You know I changed' healed. It was a devil inside me- the Witch's devil'' He was looking at her, but somehow not. Again, the Headmistress tried to ignore this. If she had been wrong about Mr Him' She could not entertain the thought. 'And the boy saw you at the village?' She had made it 'pointedly- into a question, but he did not answer, at least not for awhile. Then, 'If I am to spy on her, as I agreed, that's where I need to be. The village well leads'well, you know where the well leads'' There were too many pauses in the conversation for the Headmistress to stomach. Her guts crawled as though she had just eaten her favourite meal- a live mouse. She decided to visit the village, and soon. She hadn't - not since the last time the Witch had awoke. She didn't like to reaccaint herself with that time, and so kept away. 'And what have you found out?' she asked, abruptly as hard and sharp as her beak. His eyes flicked over her feathers. 'No more than you already know. The rumours are the Witch is abroad agaon. Something to do with Aimee and her younger brother... What was his name, again?..' The Headmistress didn't reply, so he continued. 'Something she did with him? The small creatures of the forest whisper the Witch is searching for the boy. It would help if you told me where he was hidden. I could help keep him safe.' 'The board of governors have decided that should, remain' confidential... for now,' said the Headmistress. 'I understand,' said Mr Him. Apart from his skin, and the bruises the gorilla had left, he looked calm. 'Is that all? I have a lot of planning to do.' 'Hi,' the snake nodded and lent against the radiator. He stood as he imagined a human would stand, slouched somewhere about where he imagined a human's shouders would be, as if he had arms, and as though he would be crossing them. When picking up a human child he felt it appropriate to act like a human. If he was asked, he wouldn't have been able to explain why. The dragon didn't ask him. 'Hi,' it said, in reply. The snake nodded, nochalently, it thought. He wouldn't normally stand near enough to one of the other Guardians to actually be able to talk to it, but he had been held up at the Headmistress' office being explained to, once again, about just how wayward Angel was. He was late, and the normal standing spaces had gone. 'Your Angel's guardian?' asked the dragon. 'Yesss,' said ther snake, surprised enough that the dragon had been reading his thoughts to drop, accidentally, into snake-eese. 'Yes,' he hurriedly corrected. 'Energetic boy,' the dragon said, after a moment, huffing out a line of ash across the polished floor, as she did so. Energetic was school-eese for 'trouble-making'. 'Yes,' said the snake, with an increasingly more clipped (and human sounding) syllable. 'Mine's Tower,' said the Dragon, by way of introduction. She smiled at him (the snake could tell that she was female by her colour; purple). 'Good boy, bit shy,' said the snake, and that really meant; boring stammerer. The dragon smiled again, a grin now as long as his body. 'I'm Betsy,' she said, extending a claw, which was not a simple feat, as she was large, and was wedged in the corridor to the hall. (Other parents had to squeeze by he scales and wings, casting the quickest of baleful glances as she they passed. This was in contrast to the caretaker who looked long and hard at the lines of ash that extended, like meteor strikes, from her nostrils, and burst into tears.) The snake put his tail in to the claw and they shook. To do so he had to abandon his humanish look, and this didn't please him at all. He didn't like the reminder that he was a reptile, even though he was. 'Hisssss,' he said. 'Sorry?' 'Hisssss ' that's my name.' 'Oh.' A pause. 'Can I ask a silly question?' Hisssss stared at her. Her eyes were large and yellow. 'I don't know any snakes,' he said. 'No, that wasn't what I was going to ask. I was going to ask how snakes tell each other apart, if they have names like Hissss?' The snake continued staring at Betsy, the dragon. He eventually repeated. 'I don't know any snakes.' 'Oh, I see.' Her grin became apologetic, which must have been difficult, for a dragon. 'I'm sorry.' The snake made a nose in its throat that did not sound like his name, and turned to look stoically at the classroom door. Luckily, it opened, and he slithered forward, with a quick, 'Nice to see you, I'm sure.' He always found it embarrassing talking to other guardians. Amy had seen in adult films adults putting love letters in a small, metal, paint-chipped box, and secreting the box away, somewhere hidden, somewhere safe. The adult would then say something like, 'It was the putting away of my heart,' or, 'that's where my love stayed, hidden in the dark, and every emotion I had, afterward, was nothing to the feelings that I locked in that small, old, metal box'. Amy, and not because of her age, knew nothing of love, but she knew, now, the feeling of taking the one thing you cared for (and the", "label": 1}
{"text": "one thing that cared for her) and putting it away. She carried Barney to the bed, crouched, winkled her body as one would winkle out a divot of chocolate ice-cream (in squirming, sideways motions) through the black under the mattres. She pulled aside her discarded books and toys, and hid him at the back of them all, in the corner of the space below her bed. She was to return her books and toys to their original position, and worm back out from the shadows, when she caught a look in Barney's eyes. It wasn't of sadness, or of love, or any other emotion, for that matter ' it was his look. He was looking at something, and she saw it. He was looking at the ground ' the grassy glade ' from the same kind of height as Amy, and in the same kind of wormish movement that suggested he was crawling along it. She saw stars in the black hemispeheres of his glass eyes, and she knew it was night in the Other Place, but early. The moon had not yet eaten up the sky. His sight shivered as though he shivered and he glanced around in that furtive fearful way the injured have, when they know they can take no more shocks or they would die (and when they know something hunts them). Amy's fingers tremored as she reached to his scalp, touched its roughness, and repeated herself, 'I'm sorry' sorry'' She put back the toys, the books, and shuffled out from the space, and left her teddy there, in the darkness. Chapter 3 IN WHICH PIGLET GOES ON A BEAR HUNT, AND AMY SAYS SHE WILL, BUT DOESN'T Piglet sat listening to the rain slapping on the mud above him. More puddles than mud, he guessed. It had been raining for some time, in the Latter Wood. It was unseasonably cold. The stool below him was round and short, so that his legs formed a triangle, rear trotters pressed to the wooden floorboards. As he listened to the droplets chattering excitedly on a roof made of roots, Piglet wondered what he should do with the day. 'What should I do with the day?' he said, to himself, emphasising the doing. First, he thought he might try and find Barnaby Bear and see if the Bear was interested in hearing all about how he had found the Bear. He guessed maybe not. Then he thought he might think very hard and try to move today to Friday, in the hope that Friday was sunny and, after a moment's contemplation, reckoned that if he wished for long enough that wish would certainly come true. He, however, worried that falling asleep might ruin the wishing, and decided he couldn't stay awake for so long. Finally, his thinking ran dry, and the rain refused to do so, and so he settled on masturbating vigorously, and then getting stoned. Or, getting stoned and masturbating with less vigour, he didn't really mind. It isn't easy, as you can imagine, for a piglet to masturbate. Trotters tend to be ungentle instruments to use on the small curl of a babypig's manhood. So, Piglet would sit on his stool, lean forward, and scissor his knees quickly, as though jogging in the air, until the job was done. Piglet did this, while thinking of the nipples on a sow. He was done by number five. Post-masturbatory, Piglet lit a cigarette. It didn't help the drippity-drip of boredom through his mind, but it helped to pass the time. Piglet wore a Hawaiin shirt. He loved that shirt. He liked its overstated tones. He reckoned they distracted from the fact that he wore no trousers. Also, he had a bushel of exceptionally curly hair (like a head of pig's tails) and the shirt seemed to suit this. Instead of trousers, Piglet wore y-fronts, more yellow than white, and it was debatable whether he could have removed them, if he tried. 'I'm going to find Bear,' Piglet finally said. 'Maybe he'll know where to find some honeys,' he said, by which he meant female piglets. He looked down at his yellowed crotch. 'You haven't been in a honey pot for too long.' He sucked on his cigarette and stared at the beaded curtain all done in grey. 'Ain't that right,' he said. Outside, the water spiralled from the pod-lines of the Laburnum trees, dyed yellow as though they were urinating on the dirt. The sky was drawn and quartered by the sharp branches. The clouds bled down and through. Its pall fell on his head, as he slouched through the mud. Today, the Latter Wood hung above the ground; its smell, its chill, its discontent. He sucked a cigarette and let his lips think of teats. After a while, he thought of a tune to lift his mood. 'Ho hum, ho hum, ho hum, They sing when you're up their bum, Ho hum.' He sucked and there was a swishing sound as he left the Latter Wood and passed into a glade. Amongst the long grass, there were signs of the passage of the bear, and dried welts of blood. The glade soon stretched into the plains, and the swishing became a swashing. Piglet waded y-fronts deep through a brook at the South end of the grassland, and then to the border of a dark wood. This wasn't the Latter Wood, and wasn't formed of Laburnum trees, at least as far as Piglet could see, as it was very difficult to tell when you couldn't see. This wood was shrouded, its canopy too thick to allow the droop of the draped clouds, let alone the sun above them. It was named The Copse, because, Piglet supposed, it was dark as a Corpse was, when buried six feet under. (He didn't know why the name had dropped its 'r' ' some things were just lost in translation, he guessed.) 'Bugger,' he said. 'I hate this dark wood. Can't see", "label": 1}
{"text": "a thing.' He considered his cigarette. 'Maybe this light can show the way.' His trotters scraped on the dirt, and sounded desperate, like claws on a blackboard. Piglet stumbled, and then tripped, falling headlong onto his cigarette. 'Ouch,' he squewked. The wood didn't reply. 'Ouch,' Piglet repeated, in case the wood hadn't heard him the first time. Eventualy, he found his way into verdant foothills, that became barren foothills, and then the feet of mountains. The altidude welcomed him with all the warmth of autumn turning into winter. A slashing wind made his cheeks a deeper pink, and snow fell in scurrying swarms. 'Bloody nice day this is turning out to be,' he said. In between the clumps of cold, he sought the Bear's cave. He smelt the opening before he saw it- an odour high as the altitude, of broken fur, and blood that had taken its time to congeal. Inside the cave's entrance it was dark and dank with the sweat of a large beast that had come here to die, and lumps of faeces that had fallen off or adhered to its pelt, uncared for. 'Bear?' said Piglet, into the shadows. There was the sound of shallow breathing, and then, 'Piglet?' 'What happened to you, Bear?' 'Aimee pulled off one of my arms.' 'She did this to you?' A pause. The brown bear wasn't considering, he was breathing, and it seemed to take everything he had. Then he said, 'Yes.' 'I'll kill her,' said Piglet, becoming so agitated he jumped up and down. In another world he would have been inaccurately described as tiggerish. 'I'll poke her eyes out and put them down her panties so she can see just how shitty she is.' 'No, don't do that. She was only'' Bear paused. The silence was as fecund as the cave, hung with shadows and threats and a smell close to puking. 'Bear,' said Piglet, 'you have to get out of here. The Witch has woken and is abroad, and so are her followers. I saw a Russian Doll in the Latter Wood, just last night.' 'I know.' The Bear shifted, as though an uncomfortable fact was poking into his back, where he lay. 'They'll come for you now they know you can't fight them.' The black shadow sighed. 'I know,' he said. 'Come on, then, I'll help you up' Piglet scurried forward. He reached into the shadows for the Bear's paw, so as to lever him up. It was like putting a trotter into a pocket of worms. His nails scraped over soft, pussing, broken skin. The Bear growled in pain. 'Wrong arm,' he said. 'Sorry, Bear.' Piglet stretched across and found the long, fangish claws of the bear's remaining paw. He pulled the Bear up. 'I hate this wood,' Piglet said. 'I know,' said Bear, leaning at an acute angle above his head. A ribbon of bear-saliva added a curl to the piglet's hair. With tiny squealing grunts, and breaths meaty with old blood on gums, Piglet and Bear, one leaning on the other, entered the The Copse. Inside the canopy, a stumble could not be seen, but could be heard, and a trip. 'Bear, you're on my neck,' said a whisper. 'Sorry.' Groans as something hefty was lifted. Stumble. Then; trip. 'Oh, I give up,' Piglet whispered. Amy wasn't worried the wailing would wake her Mam. Mam had never allowed a child's crying to disturb her. She, however, couldn't sleep. If her teddy bear's heart were a tape-player, this is how the screaming sound, like a baby's cries buried under the mattress, within boxes and darkness, and muffled by layers of rough, beige skin, and by tufted stuffing. Her right arm went first, then her shoulder, in a Mexican Wave of a shudder that took to the other side of her body, in turn. She cried, but not the same kind of crying; without sound, muffled only by her reticence. She would never let her Mam hear her cry. Aidan's screams for help came out of the Other Place, sweating right through Barney's hide. There were also the cooing sounds of adults coming to his aid, and of his distress lessening, but it did not go completely. He needed her; he always had. Amy was the only one who could stop him crying, even as a newborn. She crunched up her eyes and her fists and imagined the latter closing on Barney's paws, and travelling There, to comfort him, but she couldn't, and sleep only came when, in the Other Place, it must have come for him. 'I'm going on a bear hunt,' Amy said, the next day. 'Swishy, swashy, swishy, swashy.' Lucy watched her lips move, from the side, out of the corner of an eye. Hanging somewhat in the way was an immaculate crystal of blonde pigtail. Amy looked a little like a shadow cast by it. 'Oh, no. A wood,' mumbled Amy, 'a dark, scary forest. We can't go over it. We can't go under it. We'll have to go through it.' She repeated Mr Hymn, who sat before them, left arm at a right angle, holding open the pages of the book so the class could see. His face was expressionless, much as was Lucy's, though, inside, she felt burgeoning joy. She had kissed Adam at lunchtime; she had kissed him on the lips. That wasn't what made her happy, though. It was what Adam had agreed to do so he could be the first boy, the very first boy in the year, to be kissed on the lips. (And for Lucy, golden, popular Lucy, to be his girlfriend.) He had agreed, and it was coming, as sure as the bear. Lucy watched Amy as Mr Hymn ran his fingers over the lines in which the hunt party ran back across the river, through the wood, through the long grass, into their house, and up the stairs to their bedroom. Amy would tense, as she did every day, as though", "label": 1}
{"text": "her bottom was sending down roots like the seeds they put on the windowsill in year one. She would curl up like the seeds, as well. It fascinated Lucy. It being Amy. 'Oh no! It's a bear.' What did you expect? Lucy would normally have thought. Not now. Now, she thought; Now! And Adam did too, because he leant forward and roared in Amy's ear, 'RRRRRAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWR!' 'Adam!' Andy looked like he was about to say, but didn't, because Amy turned around and punched Adam in the face. Screaming inchoately, the little girl crawled over the little boy, wrenching at his body. Lucy sat very still, and very prettily, managing not to laugh as Mr Hymn pulled Amy off Adam. The little girl wouldn't let go of his right arm, though. She seemed to regard it as an abomination, wide eyed and spitting at it, as she twisted the limb this way and that, as though trying to pull it off. Lucy had never enjoyed 'We're Going On A Bear Hunt' quite so much. Mr Hymn was having a bad day. Both Adam and Amy had been stood outside the Headmistress' office at lunctime, and now his class had worked their way through the B's. Belinda stood outside the door, as she had done since the beginning of the maths lesson. Mr Hymn cast an apprehensive glance at Catherine. Both Amy and Adam had been returned to his lesson, and sat at opposite ends of the carpet. He had, rather cleverly he thought, based a maths lesson around a game of cards. He may be a southerner, but he knew how much Geordie's loved their games of cards. He guessed many of the children in his class would have played, and would be used to adding card-scores together. The way their faces lit up, and their hands went up, he had been right. A feeling of confidence glittered back through his skin. Moments like this made teaching worthwhile. It was the striking of gold; thirty rapt faces, turned to his lips, or to the board. The silence of expectation. Mrs Skinner was laminating, which only added to his mojo. Twenty-nine faces, Mr Hymn thought, noticing Amy. 'Ohh, let's see,' he said, as he held up a large, laminated card - the Jack of Hearts. 'I need one of you to do me a big favour, if that's okay.' He dwelt on each word, as though he were an actor owning the boards of a stage. 'Me,' said Adam, seemingly unable to stop himself. 'Me.' 'Now, I wonder who's sitting quietly, and really well.' The class placed their fingers to their lips, as though to staple them. Mr Hymn put the blade of his palm to his forehead, scanning left and right with his eyes. 'Weeeeellll,' he said. Inspiration came to him. It came easier, it seemed, when he wasn't blushing. 'Adam! You are sitting so well!' Adam smiled. 'Will you go to the door, please, open the door, and ask Belinda to come in and sit down.' Sprightly, face-muscles jangling, Adam stood, eyes shining. 'And, Adam..?' Mr Hymn rearranged his features into a stern expression. 'I picked you because you can show Belinda just how to walk to the carpet, and sit quietly on it. I picked you, because you are so good at that.' If Adam had shone more, his skin might well have dissolved. Instead, he walked to the door, and did what Mr Hymn had suggested he was very good at. Belinda followed. 'Nooow,' said Mr Carthcart, watching the door, and hoping he had given Mrs Skinner enough work. 'Who can tell me how much this card is worth, when we are adding?' With a flourish, he used a metre stick to point at the Jack's hat. A class of hands shot up. 'Lucy?' '10!' 'Yes, well done. And what is it called?' 'The Jack of Hearts,' said Lucy, before he could pick any one else. She smiled at him. Mr Hymn could not help but smile back. She was his favourite, and one of the few he could count on not to cause trouble. 'That's right, sweetheart,' he said, unconsciouosly copying Mrs Skinner. 'And this one? How much is this worth, when we are adding?' Click; the Queen of Spades appeared, looking diffident. 'Hmmm, Catherine?' '10!' This was going well. For one of the first times in his teaching experience, Mr Hymn felt like doing a little dance. He didn't, and would later regret that he hadn't. 'And what is she called?' The class sprouted arms, and hands like leaves. 'Hmmm,' he said. Inspiration struck again as he saw a little, grubby girl on the edge of his carpet. He was reeling them all in, today. 'Yes, Amy?' 'She's the Cunt,' Amy said. The arms went down as the class, as one, turned to stare at her. The roads went by like a bomb countdown, but in letters. When it reached A, Amy would be home, Mam would reach zero, and Mam would explode. Mr Hymn's words hung between them as the little girl's hand did, yanked by her Mam. 'I know Amy is going through a lot at the moment, but this kind of behaviour just isn't acceptable. She's been to the headmistress's office twice, today'' As ever, Amy's footsteps slowed as she approached her porch. The sun flattered the afternoon, momentarily, making the grass all the more green as the porch door closed, cutting it off. Amy's wrist clicked and her back thumped as her mother twisted her, throwing the girl into the alcove below the coats. 'Get your shoes off.' She wasn't looking down. From below, her Mam's eyes looked flinty as an overhanging avalanche. Amy quit looking and unlaced her school shoes, palms clumping on the black leather. Her socks were grey from a lack of washing. Amy laid the shoes symmetrically side by side, in the corner of the alcove. The door to the stairs had opened quietly, and the volume of", "label": 1}
{"text": "her mother's voice followed suit; low and sibilant, 'Get inside.' Amy did so and turned to face her mother, careful not to stare at her eyes, but at her waist. It was slim as ever, though Mam would change her wardrobe at least twice a month, due to 'getting fat', and would put off nights out until that bloody belly went away, and Uncle Chris only made things worse. 'What did you do?' 'I punched a boy in class and swore in class,' said Amy. Her voice was loud enough to be heard, but flat and unobstrusive. Her Mam punched Amy in the stomach. The fist caught the base of her ribs, which creaked and felt as though they had splintered, and the edge of her solar plexus. Breath was forced into her gut. Her entrails gave the impressions of balloon animals about to pop. Amy slumped onto the bottom step of the stairs. There was a loose feeling of sharded bone just below her ribcage. 'Don't be fucking clever, you little shite. What did you do to your brother?' Her mother grasped her lank, shoulder length hair and twisted it up, above her head. Amy whined, unable to keep her mouth closed, and her Mam's thin, wrinkled, black nailed fingers pressed the girl's chin into her jawbone. A line of snot popped out of her right nostril. 'I spent three fucking hours with a social worker today, answering fucking questions about poison. Seems my baby boy was poisoned. Well, I told them he's always running around the garden, so you won't get me that way. Nobody will take my little boy away from me, do you understand?' Amy tried to nod and could not. 'Think you're so clever don't you pet? Eh? Think it would be better if you lived with somebody else, you and your brother, eh?' Amy tried to shake her head, and could not. 'Well, he's back where he belongs, now. Safe in his home, with his Mam. You little back-stabbing bitch. You don't know you're born.' Her Mam pulled her head to the side and clipped her round the ear, hard enough to bounce Amy's scalp off the stairs. Amy yelped in pain. 'No bruises, now, eh, pet. Nothing to tell the socials now, eh? And what is this, mmm, what is it?' Amy stared out of tears and confusion at an object her mother held. It was brown and long and dappled with a darker brown at the end. Her sight congealed around it. It was the limb of a teddy bear. 'More poison?' Her Mam was throwing Barney's arm up and down. 'Sometimes I think about killing myself pet, I've told you before, and little you care. You'll drive me to it, won't you? You try to drive me to it, don't you?' The carpet at her forehead scuffed Amy as she shook her head. 'Sometimes I wish, I wish so hard that I could just go away, go away forever'' Her Mam pointed at the sketchpad on the floor, where Amy had left it. 'Like you, off with faeries, off in a bloody fantasy world'' Amy watched the arm as it went head over heel through the air and into Mam's hand. Her mother's eyes, as contact was made between the palm of a human and the palm of a teddy bear, became distant. She collapsed against the banister, which creaked, and down onto the square of carpet at bottom of the stairs. 'Mam?' Amy tried to rise and small clouds of darkness overcast her mind until the lights went out. One of the dark spots seemed to be sinking from her Mam's deep brown eyes into the sketchbook. Amy squatted on the step and rubbed her eyelids and saw what was happening. Her Mam had gone to the Other Place. She had sunk in, like an ink stain. Quick as her addled arms would allow, Amy slipped forward and gripped the beige pelt of the severed limb. Her coccyx jarred as she fell from the final step, sending her teeth together with a clack. She wrenched the arm from her Mam's hand, and her mother's fingers twisted open, and her eyes widened and turned back on. 'Give that to me.' Her Mam reached for the limb. Amy took it and ran, up the stairs. Her palm worked its way up the limb, fingers making for the patch of palm. Her Mam followed. There was the knock of knuckles on the door. Her mother made the sound of an unbasketed cobra and turned back to the porch. Amy could hear the words, 'Avon!' As she entered her bedroom, she closed its door, fell on her bed, and hid the arm behind its mattress. She lay listening. The door below closed, and footsteps began on the stairs, dull and distant and creaking. They ceased, and the sound of her Mam went down and away. Amy lay still, afraid that if she moved, she would change her fate, and her mother would come again. She didn't. Her Mam lay on the couch until Uncle Chris came back from work, curtains drawn and complaining of a migraine. She didn't go to work, that night, and was asleep by the time Amy dared go downstairs, to cook tea. 'Don't know what's wrong with your Mam tonight,' Uncle Chris said, in a low tone, as they ate fish fingers and chips in the kitchen. Both of them glanced at the lounge, but fleetingly, as though the weight of their gaze could wake her. 'She's been off with the faeries all evening,' he said. Amy stared at him. 'What?' he said, a finger of fish wedged in his cheek. Chapter 4 IN WHICH AMY DECIDES TO GO FROM ONE PLACE TO THE OTHER Her mother woke and bathed Amy, despite it being a Friday and despite bathing day being a Sunday. And though her Mam stripped her, and sponged her, she did not touch Amy. Instead of focusing", "label": 1}
{"text": "on Amy's naked body, on her back, her front, her thighs, she stared at the sudless water. There was nothing strange, though, about the lack of foam. 'We're too poor for luxuries, pet. Closest you'll get to bath salts is spit. Ask yer Uncle Chris to get a proper job, if you want the high life.' Mam said nothing and her daughter could see why. She could see what her Mam saw. At first, she thought it Mam's reflection in the water, pallid as it was, jaundiced like the off-cream enamel, spread about as it was by the tiny ripples of Amy's eblutions. Soon, she realised the face turned when her Mam's did not, its eyes roving across the bathroom. It was thin lipped, pursed and mean, but not as angular-chined as her mother. There were jowls, the suggestion, in the edges of the reflection of large breasts, not her Mam's double-A's, and the hair was loose, curling where her Mam's was straight and close-cut in a way that made Amy think of Elvis in disguise. The face in the reflection was searching, searching, searching for something, and was reflected from a world entirely apart from the bathroom. The thin lips were moving, sharp, cutting out sausages of speech that, though unheard, could only be commands. Absently, her Mam mumbled to herself. The face banked to its left, Amy's right, and passed below her leg, where it right-angled out of the water. In the shadows below her bare skin, which puckered despite the steam that rose from the bathwater, there was the impression of an obese woman on a broomstick thin enough to be a thong. Around her, in the shaded water, Amy could see the shapes of gorillas on the move - gorrilas with wings so grey they were almost silhouttes. Then they were, as the fat witch and the winged apes crawled up onto the bathroom wall and, like a shadow play, flapped and flew past stormclouds and over mountains and hills and trees, searching, searching for somebody. My baby, Amy thought, and her skin broke into a rash of panic. 'Where are you?' said her mother, looking for something Amy could not see. 'Strange things are happening,' said the Christian. He scratched at his scalp, under his hood, fingers searching for a forelock to tug. He settled for saluting, though there were no magpies nearby (or swallows, or sparrows). 'What's happening?' said Disdivanshumayl, leaning closer as they walked away from the locked Night School gates. From somewhere in the mists above the school a gargoyle could be heard yelling. 'And don't come back!' 'More children are disappearing than usual. And I keep finding sand.' Disdivanshumayl shambled down the alley of laburnum trees beside the perimeter of the fence. She crabbed to the side, to listen, findng it more difficult than most of the spiders in her family to lip-read, as her eyesight was fading. (Spiders are deaf by nature ' relying, as they do, on vibrations to hear.) The fence continued along the edge of the forest for some while, the Christian pausing, as he did every dawn, to tie protective idols and offerings on the algae-green metal. There was no danger of branches overhanging the railings, as the metal soared high into the clouds. Furthermore, the alley dipped as the fence took a turn right, the Night School having been built on a plateau. 'Finding and' what?' 'No,' said the Christian. There may have been no fear of the trees topping the fence, but he had a forest of fears, without this, and touched wood. For convenience, he had a twig selotaped to his index finger. 'Finding sand.' 'Oh,' said the giant spider, 'it'll be from the malleable areas. It helps the children to learn writing. You know, writing in the sand. It helps their motor skills.' 'Yeah,' said the Christian. He was distracted. He thought he had heard a flushing sound, and it remined him that the toilets needed cleaning, and whenever he thought of cleaning, he though 'unclean'. 'And children go missing all the time. You know the home lives these children have. Poor little mites.' 'Yeah,' said the Christian. 'Okay, this is me,' said the giant spider. 'Off to clean up after more kids.' 'No rest for the wicked,' said the Christian. His mind thought, 'Damnation'. They stood beside the jagged grin of a thin-entranced cave. She waved two legs at him casually and tottered in, gulped down, it seemed, by the shadows. The Christian stared after her, and wished he had a family. It wasn't a momentary wish. But he couldn't, not again, not after finding out what kind of man he was. He gulped, genuflected, and moved on. She shouldn't have been able to see what Barnaby saw. Not in the ill-lit bedroom, beneath the shroud of her linen. Not in the dead, black eyes of a teddy bear. But there it was ' she saw the passing of the Latter Wood across Barney's glass eyeballs. The trees were slanted. The long grass waved obliquely. Sweat drifted across the glass and the beige, ponderous, fabric forehead seemed to wince. She had been unable to resist, to stop herself retrieving the teddy bear from the shadows under the mattress. Amy didn't cuddle him, but held the teddy at arms' length. She shouldn't have been able to hear him, but she did. His breath, fecund with damage, with pain, with pauses. The crunch of his heavy paws on fallen leaves and scattered twigs. Piglet saying, 'Dear Witch, you're heavy.' She shouldn't have been ale to smell the faeces plastered to his pelt, where he had been unable to reach and brush it off. There was a wind in the Latter Wood, forceful and insistent as though blown from a single, screaming mouth. In the enclosed tent of her duvet, Amy's own breath lengthened, her lungs stretched in her chest, clawing for her throat, and her skin crawled with droplets of sweat. Abruptly, the", "label": 1}
{"text": "bedroom was an explosion of light and Amy wrenched her head out from under the sheets. A coffin of yellow light fell on the wall to the girl's right, across Bros. A shape twisted in the doorway, backlit by the landing. 'Are you alright?' it whispered. It was Uncle Chris. Amy nodded, eyelids weighed by sweat. The head disappeared behind the silhouette of the door, but quickly reappeared. 'Your Mam will be up soon,' it said. There was fear in the shape of bhis silhoutte. 'Go to sleep.' Amy nodded and the door closed. In the new dark, Amy ran her fingers over the teddy but withdrew. She couldn't hold him close, not after what she did to him. She didn't know how she could look at Barney. 'I'm sorry, Barnaby, I'm sorry for what I did.' She hugged herself and cried and wondered if she could ever go back to That Place. Piglet had brought Barnaby here, to the Christian's hut, in the ribcage of the Latter Wood, where the canopy curved in and even Piglet's thoughts seemed to echo between the trees. Luckily, Piglet did not have many in the way of thoughts, and those he did have tended to involve sows. Here, there was a silence that could only be described as preverbal. The Christian had opened the door to his hut and jumped. He had tugged at his cowl and appeared to decide that the brown bear and the piglet were not some unnatural hybrid, but one animal leaning on another. 'Piglet,' he had said. Then, 'Bear,' perhaps labelling them. The Christian's voice was as fast as a stutturer, but managed to fit whole words into the place a stutterer would have crammed a consonant. 'What?' His fingers perpetually twitched and fluttered, a sign language only his toes could fully see, from beyond the hems of his sleeves. 'Arm' Ripped' Off' Bare' Bum' Er' Eh?' had said Piglet, inbetween breathing. 'What?' 'Arm!.. Off!.. Bare!.. Bum!.. Er!... Eh?' With a strain that had made his snout wheeze and run slightly, Piglet had raised the brown bear, exhibiting the scrape where his arm had been. 'Fell on something sharp?' said the Christian, as he let them in. Piglet could hear him chewing his lips as he pottered through his hut. It sounded disconcertingly like crackling. The Christian moved to help him, holding the remaining, pelted arm, and the air in Piglet's lungs came out with a rush of words. 'No, something stupid. Little girl called Aimee ' his ward- ripped his arm off just to get her brother into the Night School. Ripped his whole arm off. Bummer, eh?' There was one room, and an ensuite toilet, segregated by a curtain. The whole structure smelt of intense, with sticks of the brown spice porcupining idols of Gods that Piglet did not recognise. A smorgasboard of shrines and their edible offerings lined the walls and a large table in the room's centre. Piglet could not believe the Christian had that many ancestors. Some of them were black, others Chinese. 'Just in case,' the Christian had once said. Now, he said, 'Put him on the table.' He carefully rearranged what seemed to be a family of midgets. 'In case of what?' Piglet had said, in reply. Now, he didn't speak but huffed, rolling the bear onto the boards. A small father went clattering to the floor. 'My parents lied to me, and I was adopted,' the Christian had replied. The father figurine had looked at Piglet, forlornly, and still did, several hours later. Throughout that time, as he worked on the bear, the Christian whispered to himself from between still lips, his eyes squinted on the broken, rended armpit. Eventually, Piglet said, 'Could that be your ancestor?' The Christian had been working up the bear's arm, the stunt of it, into a dough of powdered flesh and stitches. Herbs stuck out from between the needlework as though from the skin of a roasting chicken. 'It's unlikely,' said the Christian, 'But you can't be too careful.' Piglet stared at him. It wasn't often that Piglet realised something, and less often that he realised it was important, and hardly ever that he got to share the realisation. 'What?' said the Christian, looking up. The bear twitched on the table. 'You weren't whispering, then.' 'What? When?' 'When you were talking. I thought you were whispering, before, but you can't whisper when you talk.' 'What?' Piglet didn't answer, and let the night do his talking for him. Outside, beyond the hut's door, they coukld hear a sussurating sound in the silence at the heart of the Latter Wood. 'Get windy down here?' asked Piglet. 'Never,' touching one after another of the heads of his idols, and inbetween each, his own, the Christian made for the door. Together they stepped outside. 'The trees are talking to each other,' said Piglet. 'Do you know what they are saying?' The Christian had gone pale. Even from inside the hole of his hood, Piglet could see his pallour. 'It isn't the trees. It's wings. The succubus is coming. Oh Witch, the succubus is back.' Piglet opened his mouth to ask a question but, high in the sky, and far to the North, a cackling could be heard, and, instead, he lit a cigarette and filled the hole between his lips with it. There was screaming in the photo album. A stain of black swirled in and out of the sepia shades, taking what little colour they contained, toward the end, and taking the people in the photos with it. The stain had the vague shape of a woman, bloated by power and by flesh, and with the eyes - so very brown they were the holes of scorpions - of her mother. Amy shut the photo album, but she couldn't let go of its edges. The grip was all that kept her pinioned to reality - or, at least, to her version of it. Glancing to the door", "label": 1}
{"text": "that led to the square of carpet at the base of the stairs, she wondered if the adults had heard it. Mam had gone to bed early. Chris, after trying to watch Aliens (which he did at least once every month) did, too. The tape was ruined. Roaming black holes appearing like winks in its celluloid fabric. When Newt appeared on the screen, so did a hissing sound like someone screaming under the floorboards. Amy stayed up past her bedtime with Chris, who fast-forwarded, looking for a segment that still ran. But the witch was in the air vents. The witch was behind the steel shutter doors. The witch was eating the aliens. And now the Witch was in the photos, stealing away her relatives. Circling, taking them one by one, until she came, last, to Amy's baby brother. Amy turned off the light, opened the door to the stiars, passed through the jambs, and closed it behind her. The planes of it whispered at her back, on the carpet. There was whispering in the film, in the photo album, but not once the witch closed in. Amy rose up the first step, placing her left foot alongside her right. Her feet crawled, the skin itching to stay utterly still, and not daring to put one foot two steps infront of the other. Never split up, Amy thought. Chris's movies had taught her this. She took the next step. This was taking a long time. Shadows moved on the wall next to her. They had the look of women on broomsticks, and gorillas with wings. Amy ran to her bedroom, closing its door, sat on the bed, reached beneath the mattress and drew out her sketchbook. She flopped it open, and stared. The bedroom's harsh, unshaded, yellow light stared down with her. The world she had crayoned, and biro'd, and pencilled was desolated, hit by a hurricane of black swirling shadows. The stain of black, like an ink blot on the move, was swallowing tree after tree in the Latter Wood, drawing the yellow from its pods, crackling against the Christian's hut, sucking from the letters of the description Amy had pencilled next to it, of the Christian, pulling at his cowl, disrobing him. Amy reached down and shut the sketchbook. She lay on the bed and turned out the light. Barney was a lunp behind her, stopping her lying stll, or comfortably. She knw she should reach out to him. She could see what the Witch was doing, in the world she had made. She knew her baby was unsafe, but could not move her hand. Next door, she could hear her Mam snoring. 'I can't,' she whispered to Barney. She couldn't even turn around. 'Don't make me do it.' Nobody did, and she fell asleep. The toddler fell over a brick of wood and seemed to forget she had hands, using her mouth, instead, to cushion the fall. She stared at Angel long enough for him to see the scream coming. 'Okay,' Angel said, gathering up the little girl. 'Don't worry, it's okay, it's okay. Let me have a look.' The girl slowly allowed the eleven year boy to prise apart her hands. Her lips weren't bleeding. Angel checked her teeth. 'It's okay,' he gathered her again, patting her back. 'You're not bleeding,' Angel said. 'Is she okay?' said Ms Lydia, the nursery teacher. Angel looked up, and nodded. 'Not bleeding,' he said. Ms Lydia smiled at him, and walked back to the other Nursery room, connected by a low wide arch in the open plan play-area. She disappeared behind a colourful display of wind and magic dust and flying houses, which had all beeen laminated. Even so, some of the houses were cracked by little, pulling fingers. Angel could hear Ms Lydia, on the other side of the blue, yellow and red bricks. 'He's a real sweetie, that Angel. He's great with the little 'uns.' 'Ye-ye-ye-ss-ss,' replied the teaching assistant- a grasshopper. Angel glanced across to the window. 'Hey, Sunshine, keep the bricks over there. They're tripping over them.' Sunshine returned his gaze, then looked at the sallow-green carpet. She was supervising the construction area, but this site had been spread by the nursery children. 'Yes, fine,' Sunshine walked over, carrying a little boy called Gypsy. She stopped above Angel. 'You know who's in the quiet room?' she said, to Angel. Angel shook his head. The child in Sunshine's arms had quietened and was trying to explore her pockets. Sunshine guided the fingers away and put the child on the carpet. 'Aimee's brother.' Angel looked up. 'I thought he was older.' 'Yes. He is.' 'Go and play. No. Go and play,' said Angel. Sunshine's toddler waddled off. 'Why's he here?' 'Think they're hiding him.' 'Who from?' 'The Witch's people.' Angel frowned. 'Here?' 'Yes,' Sunshine leaned in, glancing around not for children, but for adults. 'Kids keep disappearing.' Sunshine watched as Tower approached, from the other nursery room. Angel's face hardened. The skin around his mouth lengthened as his lips constricted. 'They won't take him.' 'It's time to go to class,' said Tower, jabbing his finger at the clock which read Five Minutes to Hard Work. Tower looked worried. It was difficult to tell if he felt worried. Angel had never seen his face look any other way. 'How do you know?' said Peter, to Angel. 'I won't let them.' When he looked back to Sunshine, Angel glared. Sunshine shrugged with his mouth and cheeks and shoulders. 'Okay,' she said. 'Keep your knickers on.' 'We'll protect him,' said Angel, in the voice he used to ask for children's dinner money. 'Fine,' said Sunshine. 'Swear it,' said Angel. He spat on his hand, in the v between the first finger and the thumb. 'Okay.' Sunshine smiled (she loved spitting) and spat, in turn, and they shook hands. Angel turned to Tower, proferring his hand. 'Swear,' he repeated. Tower nodded uncertainly. 'Crap,' Tower said, after a moment's thought. Angel stared", "label": 1}
{"text": "Mam had left it ajar, when she came in, and sat at the side of the bed, stroking Amy's head. Her mother didn't say anything at times like these: no 'pets', no 'bairns', no stories. It was difficult to read in the dark, Amy supposed. Her Mam stroked her hair, her cheek, her chest. There was a tension in her fingers. It was like being stroked by the dead. Amy tried to think about horror movies, about zombies, but it was difficult to think of anything but fingers. She looked beyond her mother. The third member of Bros, on the hand-me-down Smash Hits poster by the mirror, seemed to lurk, a black sheep or a secret. The third member of Bros and the room were quiet, so quiet. Not shy, but scared, as if, if it made a noise, it would wake itself from a dream it desperately needed to believe in. Her mother's face, bent over Amy, was all liquered breath, like sweets sucked until gums rotted, and black nothingness. Amy didn't stare. Her Mam had told her not to stare. Amy turned her head left, toward the fuzzy, cosy corner of her bedroom, where there lay her favourite teddy bear. Barney. Barnaby Bear. Barney looked at her as though he could barely stand to, askance and rolled to one side. He reached out his patched paw and placed it within Amy's outstretched hand. The teddy bear did not smile. This was not a time for smiling. Amy was glad her Mam did not spot the teddy bear move his arm, and place it against her palm, but then of course, her Mam could not see, not through the linen, through Amy's chest and left shoulder. Besides, her mother was busy. Barney winked at Amy and the little girl thought as hard as she could about Another Place, and felt herself falling. The neck-length grass was grey, and black where it crowded together. Indistinct, it webbed against her skin. There were insects below her - she could hear their carapaces chittering, their hard limbs chattering, their lips squeaking with pleas: 'Please, don't sit on me,' they said. Or, just, 'Please!' She ignored their last wishes and sank back until she sat. The sound the grass made was a sigh like that of Aimee's soul when it upped and left her Mam. The grubs crackled. Aimee lay back, elbows behind her ears, hands gripping their joints. The stars above her hung in patterns that seemed to make sense, as if the bedroom ceiling was not still artexed to the corneas of Aimee's eyes, or her mother's face sculpted into her brain. Aimee retrieved a hand and reached out, making shapes out of the stars with her forefinger. It felt good not to be touched. The stars and her finger distracted the girl from the moon that rose in the North. The Witch's Moon. It was yellow as Chris's Stella. Aimee had just finished pointing out the outline of a man's nose (the same nose as she traced in the wallpaper beside her bed) when a roar batted the long grass. The slim waifs of the stems huddled together. The black of Aimee's pupils widened against the dark, pushing it back. Her breath made translucent speech bubbles of vapour that floated away. Her fear was nameless. The roar came again, strangely human for an oesophagus that had known the passing of man-flesh. 'Save me,' whispered Aimee, sitting in a twitch. At the edge of the swirling, whirlpool circle of grass that was the glade, there was a circumference of trees with a witch's-moon hue to them. Laburnum, thought Aimee. The thought registered but was quickly erased. A bear burst from the trees. Aimee stayed very still and her lungs tried to join in. She closed her lips. You could never tell what kind of mood a man-eating bear might be in. It could be in a girl-eating mood. She shrank where she sat. The bear had an awkward way of moving, hunched on its right. Still, it came fast. The soil shivered at her rump. Then, the bear was looming above her, its fur ruffled and annoyed, its teeth shredding the pattern of the stars. 'Come on, girl.' The bear looked down at her, canyoning the moon with its snout. 'It's time to go to school. We can't be here when the moon rises full.' In the darker hollows, Aimee could not see the wood, but could feel the trees. Their fingers were all over her. Of anything, Aimee knew the touch of fingers. Rigid, unbending; twigs all. They ripped at her dress. Aimee loved her dress. She stumbled. 'Climb on my back, girl.' He lifted her up, pressing her face into the matted, warm fur at his back. It smelt like bark after a quick, summer rain. In Aimee's extensive experience there were copses and there were forests. Then, there were forests and there were woods. And then, there were woods and there were real woods. This was the latter. The Latter Wood. It was vast and portentous, and made the 100 Aker Wood seem as small - as thin - as a drawing on a page. In the Latter Wood, the podded tendrils of the laburnum trees were black and hollow and wraithlike, pawing at Aimee's face. In certain folds of land, the yellow moon poured down through the canopy. By its lunar light, Aimee could see faces in the trees. Most of these were ugly. In the day, the trees were dirty and yellow as, her Mam would say, a Chinky's bum. Aimee did not like yellow because Amy did not like blondes. In Amy's class, during the Day School, there was a girl called Lucy. Lucy was golden and their teacher, Mr Hymn, loved her. Worse, her hair shone as if she were happy. The trees were giving up their ghost, thinning-out as the bear and Aimee approached the Night School. 'We're late for registration,' said Barnaby,", "label": 1}
{"text": "at him. 'Shit?' Tower said, a little more shakily. 'Retard,' Angel said. 'Oh, okay,' said Tower. 'We have to go. We're gonna get in trouble.' Though the night sky was flooded with cloud, the great, yellow Witch's moon still shone through it, like a skull from the bottom of pirate's cove. None of its light illuminated the forest below and the colours picked out by the swinging lanterns of the school-party were unrealistic - too pale or over gaudy up close. The Latter Wood looked for all the world as if they had been coloured in by a child. The Christian gestured for the small group of children to descend into the trough of a dale which had once been a river, only to become a muddy, natural road and then to overgrow into barely a path between low, humping, scraggly plants, and holly bushes that did their best to lean in and pick at the caretaker's robes, and prick his skin. Cursing the Gods (which, for the Christian, took some time) he waved his right arm like a one-winged bird and the focus-group lowered into the mud at the bottom of one such bush. He was breathing as though, in the hushed wood, it were going out of fashion and touched wood continually, pressing his fingers to both the twig of birch selo-taped to his index finger. He also touched his forehead. The Christian tried to avoid stressful situations but, on Tuesday nights between 1.00am and 1.30am he had to teach Ornithology. There were only five children in his group but the Christian itched with tension. He was aware, in a way that others were not, of the luck in the universe, both good and bad. He was mindful, as often as he could be, of the increasingly unlikely run of good luck that meant his parents had met, his particular sperm had impregnated her egg, he had survived infanthood, and had, as yet, not unexpectedly died. He expected to die by many ill turns (a bad egg, a hole in the forest, a dragon burping, etc') but it was the unexpected that really scared him. 'Children.' The caretaker breathed to calm himself, but found this difficult. He panicked as dizziness set in. Where was Mr Hymn? he wondered. He wasn't supposed to be left alone with the children. ('Not supposed to be left alone with children,' echoed in his mind.) 'Children!' he repeated, and waved at the edges of the group, who would not be able to see him doing so, in the night. The bank of clouds was thickening; a incoming tide over the sky. 'Please stay quiet, you'll scare the birds.' The magpie aviary was nearby. In the dark, lanterns bobbed and giggled. Gold light limned the leaves. 'What birds?' a boy's voice said. 'Shhhhh,' said the Christian as he often did. Feathers erupted out of a holy bush and a girl screamed. It was a magpie. 'Shhh,' said the caretaker, again, and reached for his forehead. The first bird was followed by a second and The Christian breathed silent relief. A third magpie flew over heard, crying out, its shape an unmistakable taper. A fourth, then a fifth, followed. 'Gold,' whispered the Christian, as the lanterns rose. 'Stay down.' An unpleasant feeling was rising close to his heart, unsettling it. A sixth. A seventh. There was a movement in the Latter Wood. Two footed. A man, or a child - the Christian couldn't see which through both the foliage and the lack of light. His fears must have multiplied, because the group of school-children quietened. He could hear the squelches of them pressing their small bodies into the mud. The Christian rolled prayers around his mouth like a gob-stopper. There were paws moving on dirt, audible through the forest floor; squirrels and moles on the move. The shape out there was muttering. It sounded as though it were saying, 'He needs me, he needs me, he needs me.' Then, between a thumb of leaf and a finger of twig, the Christian saw it. A child so pale it gave off its own pallour. The child's eyes appeared to be as much gouges as its mouth (blood-edged and slitted vertically) and widened as it continued to moan, 'He needs me, he needs me.' Its fingers twisted back over themselves, touching the back of their own palms. They caught the opposing wrist regularly and strangled it. 'He needs me,' the child repeated. A line of tears, as much snot as water, fell from its left eye and hung from its protruding lower lip. The Christian shivered as it did, before falling. One of the children in his group (Sunshine, he thought, though he didn't really know their names) gasped. The figure stopped, and stooped and turned toward the bush that hid them. The prayers in the Christian's mouth began to go off. To falter. He forget the names of half the Gods he believed in. A bell tolled, somewhere far to the North, and the child-figure raised its head and moaned. 'He needs me.' It turned awkwardly - with arms as contrary as the ends of a pinned worm - and ran. 'Thank fuck,' said the Christian. The Christian stumbled home through the grey forest, touching the wood taped to his finger. He touched it nine times, then seven, then five, then three, then one, and did it all again. The morning had the feel of a time that would require all the luck he had. Arriving home, he pailed water from a trough that trickled from his overhanging roof-tiles. He didn't have a well, as he did not trust them. He had read his tales, and strange things hid in wells. Also, you could never be entirely sure where they led, even if you had dug them. Wells were slippery things. 'Piglet, is that you?' he said, as he approached the shade of the porch. It had yet to see the light of the dawn sun,", "label": 1}
{"text": "and given the canopy, would not until the afternoon. A dot of light nodded. 'Yep,' said Piglet, removing the cigarette. 'How's the bear?' 'Still asleep. His arm looks better, though.' It had been a hard night, and the Chrisian walked past the pig, where he lay, staring up at the eaves of the hut. The door scraped open as the Christian entered. He turned and began to light one after another of the insence sticks, and bent to the shrines. Beyond the huffing of his sack cloth, as he bowed, and the crackling of insence sticks as they lit, he did not hear the wings of gorillas, until, at least, Piglet ran in. 'It's the Witch,' said the little pig. 'It's the Witch.' The Christian stared at his assembled Gods, at the Bear, swallowed, and said. 'Help me hide him. Then hide yourself.' Piglet hid behind the curtain, beside the hole in the floor that was the Christian's toilet. It didn't smell of incense, in here. In the main room, Bear sat by the door, still comatose, insense sticks stuck in his ears, and in the stiches of his arm. Some of them were smouldering. 'What is that?' the Witch had said. 'An offering to the bear god, you can't be too careful, not with the mountains nearby.' The Witch's voice was thick as chocolate melting in a cauldron. 'Smells fresh.' 'Make a new offering every week,' said the Christian. 'You are always so careful, aren't you, my little man?' The sound of the Christian's gulping would have been enough to flush the toilet near Piglet's feet, if there had been a flush. 'You're not invited in,' he said, 'succubus.' The Witch laughed. It was a giggle more than a cackle, despite her girth. She was beautiful, with hair dark as her dress, the satin of which was split up her left leg, but Piglet had no idea how her broomstick flew. She was big. Piglet watched her from between the lining of the curtain as she walked forward, looking directly into the Christian's cowl. He cowered backward, against the table. 'You are a silly boy,' she said, touching his cheek. 'Pathetic boy. I'm not a succubus, and I'm not a vampire. I'm a Witch, idiot, and I don't need to be invited in. I'll come anyway, just like you do, when you see me.' She pulled down the Christian's hood as he blushed. His ugliness was the opposite of her skin. Clumps of scarred cheeks and forehead and chin that looked as though he was half made, while she was finished. Her's was the kind of face that made men think 'yes', while his would make women say 'no'. She rose over him, and shadows of her huffed out half the insence sticks in the room, with a sound between the sibilance and sighing. Smoke curled around her head and a thin arm, as her perfect hand found the nook between his robes, below his waist. 'You're in love with me, aren 't you? You see me in your sleep. And just to think, even the thought of your face is enough to make me gag.' The Christian looked past the witch, at the bare floor. His will seemed to be spreading as thin as the straw scattered there. 'So bashful. Your eyes may be looking down, but your snake-eye is looking up. Is this what it wants to see?' She drew satin back from her left breast. The cloth sounded like it rather enjoyed it. The Christian's pock-riddled cheeks bunched and withered and bunched as he swallowed and gulped. His eyes found her nipple. Her hands were moving against him. Her body pressed him to the table, his buttocks below the rough ends of its top, his knees bent before her's. 'Tell me, my pathetic little man, what I want to know.' 'No.' But his breaths were louder than his mouth, and his head was nodding in small, frantic jerks. 'All men are mine,' the witch whispered. 'I have gorillas outside, hairy and strong. They'll beat it out of you, or I could get it out of you. You like the way I do it, don't you?' He was shaking, fingers out of control of the tabletop. They were clawing. The witch's hand stopped moving. 'Please,' said the Christian. She smiled. The twist of her lips said 'pathetic' better than her tongue. 'The world is out of joint,' said the witch, leaning in to speak into his ear lobe. 'A little girl broke the natural laws, and brought in a little boy, who was not allowed here. That little boy belongs to me.' Her hand began again. Her eyes danced on his face, sharp as stilletoes. 'Give him to me,' she said. 'The Night School,' he gagged on his words as his body jolted. 'Yes, of course.' His robes, below her hand, dampened. 'The nursery,' he said. 'The boy with blue eyes.' The Witch withdrew, wiping her hand across his face. 'You are an easy, little bitch,' she said. She laughed. 'And you get easier every time.' She stopped laughing. 'And now I'm bored of you.' She reached across the table, clutched an incense stick from the head of a black ancestor and stabbed the Christian in the throat. There was a mild hiss, and the escaping of a bubble of blood. The Christian collapsed fully to the floor, gagging, pulling clumsily at his throat. Piglet's trotters sprang to the fabric of the curtain, but he had the heart of a very small porcine creature, which is to say the heart of a coward, and he couldn't part the cloth. The Witch picked up a burning insence stick, reversed it, and put it in to the Christian's eye, and into his brain. She repeated the action with a second stick, and the other eye. 'Well,' she said, glancing at the halves of incense sticks that could still be seen. 'You should always touch wood. It's lucky; hadn't you", "label": 1}
{"text": "heard? Now, you'll never be unlucky again.' With a laugh short as a slap, she walked out of the hut. Piglet rushed into the room. The Christian had stopped moving. Outside, heavy wings began to flap, and the twigs at the end of a broomsrtick could be heard, mildly thrumming, as the Witch took to the air. 'No,' said Piglet, trotter to his mouth. He rushed back into the toilet and vomited into the hole, helping its smell not at all. When he had finished voiding his bowels, he straightened, wiped his mouth, plastered back his piglety curls and walked out of the hut to the nearest tree. He knocked on it. A horshoe of bark opened up, and a squirrel's afce peered out. 'What? I've already paid you for the milk.' 'Shut-up,' said Piglet. He didn't think he had long before his guts found something else to chuck at his mouth. The squirrel winkled its small, black, wet nose. 'By the Witch, are you alright?' It asked. 'Listen,' Piglet lent in, which the squirrel didn't seem to think much of, and whispered. 'Tell everyone, the Witch is coming. The Night School will be attacked. Tell all the guardians.' 'Oh bugger,' said the squirrel, before closing its front door. Piglet could hear the scamper of small feet, inside, and the chatter of a small mouth talking at speed. Piglet slumped against the tree's root system, and went back to simply breathing. They were in the last week of term and, as such, the sun was out, outside, and, in the classroom, the blinds were drawn. It would have been dark, inside, but for the light from the television as it lapped over the flowered faces of the children, turned up to face it, eyes wide as opened petals. It was the only way to keep them quiet. Mr Hymn had turned his mind to the next year, the new class that would be coming, and bathed in the internal glow of seeing the backs of several of his children. He wouldn't have said this, in his thoughts, let alone out loud, but he had never found a way to deal with several of them, and Adam and Aimee in particular. He was looking at the levels from the years below, and wondering how many of them had been doctored to be higher than they should be. This was just another thing that he wouldn't say out loud, and he shared this reticence with at least one of the children, one of which was thinking, as she watched The Wizard of Oz, I've got to save my baby. The Witch is not dead. None of this reached her lips, nor, in any discernable way, the rest of her face, which was unmoved as it stared at the screen, though she saw her in the background of each scene, be it Dorothy dancing on the Yellow Brick Road, the Witch sending out her monkeys, the green wizard operating is machine. Even in the shadow cast by the balloon. There were shapes moving in the cornfields. The shadows of the trees were gorrilas on the wing. In the aisles of the Emerald City, a long, female, taloned arm reached for a baby. Outlines moved on the keys of the wizard's organ, and they were not his fingers. It played an unknown tune. The Wizard of Oz was her favourite film (though she had only ever watched at Granny's or at school) but not this time. Adults forget how uncomfortable it is to sit crosslegged on the floor for long periods of time. They never had any idea of how uncomfortable it is to sit crosslegged while your younger brother is being kidnapped and you can see it happening. Amy bunched her fingers around her skirt. I've got to save my baby. She had to get back home, back to Barney. She hated herself for failing to reach out to him. Amy put her hand in the air, the elbow seeming double-jointed the way it bent back against the air, as though trying to throw it off. 'Miss,' she said. Like most of the children she forgot, often enough, the second syllable of Mister Hymn's title. Mr Hymn looked up and answered, as though he did too, 'Yeees?' 'I need the toilet.' She crinkled around her crotch, as though dissolving. 'Go on, then.' Mr Hymn sighed. Amy rose, her mind a tornado of superheated thoughts. Her skull knew, now, how Dorothy's house felt. She crossed infront of Lucy, who shifted slightly, as she always did, to surreptitiously trip her. Sidestepping, Amy considered kicking the blonde girl inbetween the pony tails. She didn't, but continued to the door, leant her frame backward to open it, walked to another, opened that, turned left into a corridor that was carpeted but smelt of old urine. She stopped. Out of the side of her eyes, she had seen the line of coats, on her class's pegs. Looking to one end then another of the corridor, Amy listened. Closeby, a child was being taught phonics. 'A digraph is'' said an adult. 'Two words make one sound,' said a child. 'Two' make one sound.' The teacher paused. '' Words?' 'No! Two'' 'Sentences?' They wouldn't be moving for awhile, thought Amy, crossing to the pegs. Her eyes scanned above the top of the curves of red metal, until she saw 'Lucy', decorated as it was by a scenary of butterflies and stars and hearts. She took Lucy's summer coat, which was thin and light pink, off the peg and hurried into the toilet. It was Nike, and Lucy always wore it at breaktime, even in the sun. She didn't have long. Closing the cubicle door, Amy pulled down her stockings and school underwear and peed for a while, letting out what she needed to, staring at the coat on the floor. She kept some back, though. Over the years living at home, Amy had become an expert at controlling her body.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Reaching forward she grasped the coat, opened one of the pockets on its side, and crouched again. Lucy was still crying when Amy's Mam came. The little blonde girl sat in the corner of the carpet, desperately scraping at her coat pockets with damp paper towels. She had refused Mrs Skinner's offer to take it to the kitchen and clean it, and the fabric had threatened to rip when she had tried to take it out of Lucy's small, blonde hands. The blinds were open and the sun shone down on her, in the reading area, making bright spots of her tears. Her sobs were loud enough on their own and needed no highlighting. Amy's Mam, for the first time, blushed when she collected her daughter, which was not a good sign. 'The breaktime monitors had to pull them, apart,' said Hymn. 'I'm afraid your daughter was saying some very nasty things about how Lucy smelt. And, of course, she admitted to urinating on her coat'' At this, the sound of Lucy's scrubbing increased in ferocity, and Amy was dragged from the classroom. Amy stood in the centre of her bedroom and tried to smile. This hurt, and she pulled the masking tape from her lips, her mother having applied to her face. Amy guessed that was why the tape was called masking. Now, Amy could smile, and did so fully, her lips picking their way around aching teeth. There were no bruises on her face. Her jaw throbbed from the clenching Amy had given it. Though her kidneys and bladder ached from the fists that fallen there, she stood tall as a lightning conductor in a gathering storm. She could feel it coming. She had reached home in time. She was going to save her baby. Hurrying to her bed, she drew its frame back and withdrew Barney's abdomen and severed arm. Having stolen a sewing kit from the downstair's cupboard (under the stairs, behind the iron, on the shelf by the red linen basket ' Amy knew the cupboard well), she crouched, then sat, and went about refixing Barney's arm to his body. She stopped once, only, despite all the shouting from downstairs, when her mother put her face to the bedroom door and screamed, ' I'm going out tonight and you'll not stop me you ungrateful brat. You can just stay in there ' no tea- and no bothering the babysitter. And stay away out of your brother's room, you sick little shit'. Amy's heart had expanded with blood it could not handle, and her nape drained, becoming pale, but her Mam had not come in and, instead, dragged at the door, jangling it though it was closed already, tight against it jamb, saying, 'I don't want to see your ugly, ungrateful face. If you want a piss, do it in your clothes instead of some other poor bairn's. Don't you dare come out.' Then, the sound of steps on the stairs. Then, the lounge door slamming. Then, vaguely, the television. 'I'm sorry, Barney,' Amy said, on each needle stroke, each skewering his beige skin. Sweat rose up her hairline and finally stood on the skin of her forehead. She squinted and sewed. Outside, dusk crept in with long fingers of dark cloud, each shaped into the form of a witch, or a gorilla, to the girl's quick glances. She spared nothing more of her eyes. She wasn't good at sewing, and had more work to do, besides. Her sketchbook was ruined, and she knew she wouldn't get back into her world if she didn't rewrite the pages that the Witch had ruined. Amy finished Barney's arm, patted him on the pelted forehead, and put him on her bed. Downstairs, she heard Uncle Chris rush in, the patter of her Mam's nagging. It sounded like rain falling from the moss-hung gutters. Not long after, there followed a knock. The babysitter. Amy coloured, working yellow backward and forward over the Latter Wood. 'Oh, she was tired from school. She went to bed early.' Her Mam said this loud, loudly enough for Amy to hear. 'She won't come out, not tonight.' There was the noncommittal, gum spooling grunt of a female teenager. 'Yah, hah,' it said. 'We won't be late, alright pet.' 'Alright,' brighter, happier sounding at the sound of adults going, 'have a good time.' Uncle Chris said, 'Aye, thanks, pet.' His sentence was awkward on the last word, like Uncle Chris' eyes were when Amy wore her skin-coloured pjamas. She coloured the The Copse, the Glade she landed in, the Under Hill on the northern horizon, and the Dark Tower Block of the Witch that lay below it. She sketched the Night Scool, and its gates and the Christian's hut, but her pencil nib chipped when she tried to draw his convulated face, and snapped entirely as she tried to pen his biograpnhy. Amy knew better than to try again, and ' after sharpening - her pencil moved on, switching colours as she went, until the world map was drawn and the characters written next to it, with thumbnail sketches, and quotes from her flora and fauna and mythology reference books, all of which readily came from her memory. Breathing heftily, unlimbering her fingers (which felt like icicles of lactic acid), she lent back. She was ready and so was Barney. There was a car on the drive, distant as hailstones. Amy's hips sent flares of pain into her legs, until they met the pins and needles of her lower extremities, which were numb. She tottered to the bed and nearly fell on its duvet. I'm coming, she thought, her brain anything but numb. The front door opend as she took Barney by the arm and pulled him down to the blue carpet, next to the sketchpad that lay open on it. The sound of kissing on the stairs, and fumbling at outerwear. The babysitter giggled, the sound of laugher rising and falling as if hands around", "label": 1}
{"text": "the man Amy could hear on the stairs. His breathing was heavy and the stairs creaked slightly below his weight. Amy looked up, concentration broken. 'Upstairs,' said the babysitter. 'They've gone.' The stairs creaked, as though nodding in agreement, and the man said, after a breathless pause, 'Aye.' Then, he added, 'You make me so horny.' The giggle. Amy imagined eyes like her Mam's at the pub where she worked, when she was flirting with a man who wasn't Uncle Chris, downcast, almost far enough to meet her own lips, which were smiling in a funny way, as if they weren't really laughing, but thinking about something else. Amy, despite her experience, never knew what. Amy sat as their feet went past her door. 'In their bed?' said the man. 'They'll smell it.' 'Jesus, you're a pussy,' said the babysitter. 'Your pussy, you mean' said the man, and laughed. Amy couldn't tell what was funny. The babysitter laughed but it didn't sound real, then said, 'What about that one.' 'Nah, too small.' Amy looked down at the sketchpad's open pages, placing her hand on it. If her arm was a root, it shook, as if in a quickening wind. 'What about that room?' 'The girl's in there. She's sleeping.' 'Kick her out. A bairn won't know what we're doing. Give her a video, she'll be away with the faeries. Put the sound up loud.' 'What like?' 'I don't know, Disney or owt.' Amy closed her eye and gritted her teeth and subdued an urge to scream. Her bedroom door shifted, like the first impacts of aliens on a metal blast shield, and then, inevitably, opened. The baysitter stood in it, a fake smile as big as the space between the jambs, or so it seemed to Amy, infront of her teeth. 'Hiya, pet,' she said. 'Oh, you're awake, that's great. Come on, do you want a video on? Have you got any good ones?' She held out her hand. The nails were pink and black and shiny. Amy nodded, head numb as her feet had been. The babysitter reached forward and took her by her fingers and, before the girl could refuse her, pulled her to her feet. 'Com'on. Up and at em.' Amy grasped her sketchbook, touting it by a page which, thankfully, didn't rip. Amy's heart did, though, when she grabbed Barney and his arm fell off or, rather, his body, which fell to the floor, bounced apathetically and rolled to the side, half under the bed. 'Nevermind,' said the babysitter, all smiles and breezy syllables. 'I'll fix him up right as rain.' Her voice was several octaves higher than when she had been talking to Amy's Mam. The babysitter extracted Barney's arm from Amy's sweaty grip, put it on the floor, and pulled Amy through the door. Listening to the sound of the man's heavy body easing onto her matress, and the moaning of the springs under it, the steps passed under Amy's feet in a blur of green and patterned foliage. Above her scalp, Aidan's room-door passed out of sight. It was closed. She wasn't allowed in, not since Mam had found out about her poisoning him. Not a sound drifted down, from the chipped, white door, and hadn't since Aidan had returned from the hospital. He seemed to sleep all the time. Amy had heard her Mam say, on the phone to Granny 'the doctor said that's to be expected, after what she did to him'. Her voice had dribbled venom into the receiver. Momentarily, Amy was downstairs in the lounge, staring at a selection of videos through eyes that were doing their best not to cry. 'Oh, look,' the babysitter said, 'this one's good. How about Labyrinth?' Amy nodded, distracted by the thought that the evening couldn't get any worse. As she swooped throught he trees, the Headmistress thought it was it was colder than she remembered, here in the North of the Latter Forest. The Witch's realm was on the spread. Global cooling, she thought, and had no idea why. It didn't take her long to reach the folds of white land, light wrinkles in a tablecloth (from the air at least) and shorter again to reach the village outskirts. She landed on a branch, silently bar the slight crunch of frost. Her white plumage left her feeling safe- camoflaged, and night was falling- dusk dusting itself off. There was something luminously yellowed about the frozen north, as though it kept the light long after it should do- hoarded it. If the Headmistress had lived in the Other place, and was a reader, she would have been put in mind of Miss Havisham, in Great Expectations, and wedding cakes, and wedding gowns. All was quiet on the northern front, and the Headmistress' lungs opened as, finally, she felt she could breathe. They had been crampt since her talk, that day, with Mr Him and the boy called Angel, little tumourous growths of worries worming their way into them- constricting her oxygen intake. She almost didn't hear the sound of screaming, over the sound of her relaxed breaths, but then she did. Gulping as though down a whole mouse, she flapped to the snow, and hopped and skipped to the side of the first house. She bent her head to the chocolate bricks of its exterior. She could hear a mole fart from a forest away, and so had no trouble hearing the screaming again, and her mind took even less time to remember what it meant. Children were in the house, and the Witch's minions were doing things to them. And if children were in the hosue, someone at the school must have put them there, and that thread of thoughts led only to' With a leap, the Headmistress took to the air. Her eyes were large enough to cry great bells of teardrops and they quickly froze to her feathers. She had allowed this to happen on her watch. To happen to", "label": 1}
{"text": "children under charge. The guilt burnt even more than the wind, thugh it was coruscatingly cold. The guilt consumed so much she didn't look up, and see that the unveiling stars had been blotted out by a swarm of wings, like locusts, but bigger, more Gorilla, until they took her in mid flight, and snapped her spine, and one of them ate her in one gulp. Mrs Her brushed her beard, which had a habit of growing all the way around her head, away from her eyes. She did not watch the charity drive, which had been merged with a talent show under the heading of Children Need Talent, but stared at her class. They sat with the precision of broken minds, a moulding process Mrs Her had perfected over three decades of teaching at the Night School. The attention of Mrs Her was taken, and with some glee, to the class that sat in front of hers. Angel and Peter were talking, which they did whenever Mr Him avoided assembly, and were comparing Top Trump cards. 'Angel and Sunshine!' Mrs Her said, a little louder than she needed. 'Be Quiet! Do I need to remove you from this assembly? And Tower!.. I expect better from you!' At the front, a year six was making a balloon dragon. The boy's intent stare seemed to squewk in the attempt, as much as the rubber did. The dragon's tail abruptly popped and the balloon sped away around the hall, piffling gently in a way which would have embarrassed Fafnir. It had the same effect on the boy, who went red as a burn. Angel looked directly at Mrs Her and resumed his conversation. Mrs Her rose. 'Fine,' she said, under her breath and her beard. Glaring at them, she walked to the boy and girl, grasped them by the ears (left and right, respectively) and out dragged them from the assembly. She only had to glare at Tower to make him follow, his face exhibiting more agony than either of the other children. 'Right,' she said, levering them against the wall outside the hall. 'I'm going to talk to Mr Him about you three, and'' 'Where is he?' said Angel. There was a tone to the boy's voice that slowed down Mrs Her's, and made her ask, 'Why do you ask?' 'He's taking children.' 'What?' Below her beard, Mrs Her began to colour, and the colour wasn't pale. 'That's why he's always missing assembly,' said Sunshine. 'Didn't you see him leave with one of the year two children?' 'Now, look, here, you two- three'' 'Th-they're right.' Tower didn't stumble on the 'right'. Now they mentioned it, gears were beginning to click within Mrs Her's brain, cogs starting to align. She saw Mr Him escorting the child out, when the small boy hadn't made a sound, all assembly. She remembered the times she went looking for the teacher, and he wasn't in school. She recalled the way he looked at some of the girls, especially when they wore stockings. She gulped. 'Well.. look' you three will stay here, and I'll find Mr Him, and I don't want to hear any of you making this kind of accusation, again.' Mrs Her hastened down the right hand side of the stairs that led down from the hall, her feet stumbling where Tower had not. Watching her leave, Sunshine said, 'Well, that was easy.' 'Y-y-y-why today's assembly?' asked Tower. 'Things are happening. We need to find Mr Him before it's too late. The caretaker isn't at school today, and he always is. And he saw the thing in the Wood. The Headmistress isn't here, either, and I told her about Mr Him' Things are happening,' he repeated. With that, Angel and Sunshine left there positions on the wall. 'Let's split up,' said Angel. 'I'm going to look after Angel, you two look for Mr Him. Whatever is coming, is coming for Aidan.' Angel stared at Tower. 'Well, com'on Tower!' With a sigh, Tower pushed himself from the wall, looking as much like he was unsticking himself from honey, as moving through thin air. He followed Sunshine. Mrs Her strode down the corridor to the dining hall, and from there, the corridor to the staff room, and from there the corridor to the reception. In each rtoom there was a clock, and each clicked closer to one in the morning, and the time the assembly would end. For some reason, the clock-hands tickled up the feeling that it didn't matter if Mrs Her w s there to collect her children. She just needed to find Mr Him, though, for some reason, she couldn't ask the receptionist, or any of the other teachers. Cat got my tongue, thought Mrs Her. In actual fact, it was knowing that the children were right. Then, she saw Mr Him, at the end of the corridor going back to the dining room. He was with a child. 'Mr Him!' she shouted. He didn't turn, but walked through the door, letting it close behind him. She paced then strode then jogged after him. Soon, she was running. A guardian came the other way and Mrs Her had to pause to keep the door open. In the school, etiquette was a paper/scissor/stone situation. Children held the door for teachers, teachers for guardians. Mr Him, evidently, hadn't. He was nearly at the hall but - she saw - didn't continue to it, turning, instead, to go inside the Disabled Toilet' With the child. He didn't even bother to look around, thought Mrs Her. For some reason, this struck her as important, though it wasn't until a few seconds later, when the Witch attacked, that she realised why. She ran to the door and, feet jiggering on the blue carpet before it, waited. The disabled toilet made a flushing noise. Mrs Her waited. The cistern began to refill. Mrs Her waited until she noticed the toilet door was marginally ajar. She tugged at her facial hair,", "label": 1}
{"text": "growled, then entered the disabled toilet. It was empty. Mrs Her turned, closed, and locked the door from the inside. 'SHIT,' she said, as loudly as she could, to the toilet bowl. The toilet bowl stared at her, and didn't answer. 'SHIT,' she repeated, unlocked the door and stepped into the corridor. An older child stood there, staring at Mrs Her. She opened her mouth, closed it, and opened it, and said, 'It helps me to go.' She walked away. The spikes withdrew and the gargoyles rose from their points on the apex of the fence. 'Thank the Witch for that,' said one, clutching its buttocks. He quietened when he saw what was coming. Around the perimeter of the Night School, a phalanx of gargoyles took to the air and turned North. Infront of each of the external windows, metal, corrugated shutters rattled down. Doors were locked from the inside and the staff near the rececption began to gather in the staff room. The shadow of Tower's dragon was curled around the tower of the goblins. As the silhouttes of winged gorillas filled the air, it launched, sanguine in all but the darker line of determination that was its jaw. Its wings beat above above the Labyrinth and the stocky, butterflied figures surrounded it. Black blood spread in the Labyrinth. Even Rainbow Bright was made entirely of black cloth cut from another reality, montaged to this celluloid one. She bounced from gorilla to gorilla but the outline of the Witch's minions dragged her down. Eventualy even the monotone was extinguished. David Bowie sang 'You Remind Me Of The Babe' and Amy stared as the cut-out of Mrs Her ran through the corridors of a school that could only be seen in impressions of charcoal. Her mouth was opening and closing. 'Get in your classrooms,' Mrs Her ran down the corridor toward the hall, 'Stay in your classrooms, children!' News of the attack had spread quickly. She didn't see Angel, Sunshine, and Tower running from class 7. Angel carried a dining knife as though it were a sword. Above her the roof reverberated to a blast that could only be a dragon killing. Through the window to the inner courtyard she saw a gargoyle hit the floor. It had shattered long before and the fragments of it pelted the window pane. She - her heels especially - screeched to a stop, as she stared toward the hall. Mr Him, more in shadow than not, more made of silhouette than lit, was struggling with an invader. Mr Him was wet through. Mrs Her ran toward him. 'What do you think I come to this school for?' she heard Mr Him say. 'I'm your teacher, you'll do as I say.' On the blue carpet, a lion lay dead, gutted peremptiously from its entrails to its third rib. Mrs Her rounded on Mr Him's assailent. It was Downbeat. Mrs Her blinked, her eyes narrowing between fringe and beard. He had a knife around Downbeat's pale throat. The boy's neck was stretched and turned toward Mr Him, and pallid even where pressed by the blade. Downbeat was sweating and crying and a dark patch made a pool at the front of his silver shorts. The figure in the sign of the disabled toilet was sat bolt upright as though it had heard something. 'You'' Mrs Her couldn't put a word to the shape of her lips. 'Yes, me,' said Mr Him. 'They love me. They're mine. They certainly don't belong to their parents.' Mrs Her could hear it now: a rattle of pipes. Mr Him backed away from the toilet. 'She's coming,' he said. Toilet water dripped from his moustache and into his open mouth. Mrs Her drew herself up. With her ill-kempt hair, she hadn't properly heard him. 'He most certainly is not. Not with you,' said Mrs Her. The disabled door exploded open. Mrs Her watched, but not for long, as the disabled figure came toward her, on half of the door. The figure had deposed of his wheelchair and, for that moment, appeared healed. What was left of the door hit Mrs Her and she collapsed below it. When she came round, it had all already happened. Tower ran across the inner courtyard, his stride a line of tics and shakes and convulsions. A gargoyle plummeted to where he stood and Tower dodged right, with his gait's natural confusion. It saved him, as the gargoyle impacted where he had, a moment before, ran. Tower was breathing hard enough to dry his tongue. His cheeks were constellated with dots of red, his eyes with stars. He didn't think he could keep going, but he could see his guardian, curled around the gazebo in the courtyard centre, fending off a ribbon of gorrilas. They clustered at him and struck, and hissed and their mouths gaped as open as their fangs were long. By contrast, their wings seemed scarcely able to hoist them, thin as the slips in photo albums, before you put the pictures in. Tower bent, mid stumble, scooped and pitched a stone at the closest, hitting its right wing; tearing it. The ape roared, tore at its chest and turned to face Tower. Tower shook. He was no longer running, but his lungs bellowed like they hadn't been informed. His guardian, Betsy, with a gheko-esque snap of its head, turned and bellowed fire across the gorilla's right flank, further blackening it, and the ape fell to the earth, no longer roaring. With a leap, the dragon jumped to earth, landing beside Tower. The boy grasped its spine and, with an aptitude lacking when attached to the ground, scampered up to sit behind its head. 'Fly,' he shouted, in the kind of tone a child would take with his teddy bears - or dolls - and not with a fifty foot purple dragon. 'Easy, you're right by my ears. Scream like that and you'll give me a stroke,' said Betsy. Betsy flew and,", "label": 1}
{"text": "before long, Betsy fought, and Tower had her back. Amy had turned off the television, leaving the video running, and sat in the corner, mapping out the stars above the world she had created in her sketchbook. By the sounds from upstairs, the babysitter wasn't coming down anytime soon, and it didn't sound as though she was sewing. Her next best hope, she knew, was that her Mam came home. Amy picked up the pad and walked softly to the other side of the room. She turned off the light by the door and listened to the babysitter saying, 'Not yet, not yet, not yet, I'm nearly there, nearly there.' The little girl shrugged and sat down in the curve of the alcove, in the end of the curtains, where she liked to, where the light from the orange street lights outside sunk down into the well between windowsill and cream curtain lining. Peeking above the sill, she watched the street. It was quiet in the Close, and humid. The wallpaper was a cool hand at her back, reassuring in the heat. The vertical, pale bunches of the curtain wrapped around her, like giant fingers. She thought this was how Sophie felt in The BFG. She thought about children's stories, as she was wont to. Amy liked children's stories. She didn't believe any of them, but it was nice to imagine that, somewhere out there, there were children who did. She didn't mean to but, closing her eyes, Amy fell asleep. He saw Sunshine's Rainbow Bright die mid leap, flickering out of existence for the last time. Sunshine followed her; disappearing. Tower could not help which, for him, was nothing new. He was an inaccuracy of a child, good for nothing but an occasional kicking. More tellingly, his dragon, Betsy was rent down the ribs by scores of scratch marks. She had been losing blood, dribbling red down through the air like spilt wine and had faded herself, now, from her purple hue to a tinged black. It was the colour of twilight giving up the ghost. 'Come on, Betsy. Come on.' Tower was no longer shouting, and had rocked forward to cuddle the dragon around her throat. 'Umf erg flee,' said the dragon. Tower sat up straight. 'What?' 'You're strangling me,' said Betsy. Even unrestricted, her voice was weak. 'What?' 'I have to land,' she whispered. The boy didn't need to hear her; the dragon came to a rumbling, bad landing on the Key Stage Two playground. There were no apes to be seen. The school building to their right reverberated to the shock of magic being unleashed within. Tower's ears ached to the vibrations of wind and screams. He swung one leg around the dragon's neck and was about to dismount, when he saw an eye beside his left fist. It was closed and the lid jostled as violently as Betsy's body did, as she breathed. 'Betsy.' He hugged her again. She seemed to smile, though it was difficult to tell with a dragon. 'How can I help you, Tower?' she said, in a whisper. 'Are you..?' Tower's voice shook as his body habitually did. 'Are you..?' 'Yes.' Tower's voice hardened. 'Thank you for bringing me here, Betsy. I have really enjoyed it.' 'Tower.' Blood wheezed out with the words. 'You're stronger than you think. You'll make it through. You'll be big one day.' 'I know,' said Tower. 'I love you.' Betsy breathed and Tower held her until she stopped. The boy faded out of This Place, and back into The Other. A car pulled into their drive, its tyres gritting both Amy's teeth and the gravel. She sat abruptly where she had been slumped in the lounge, in the dark with the lights off. She needed to go to her room. Momentarily, she couldn't recall how she got here, at all. She needed to get to the Other Place. These were her thoughts and they went no further. Her limbs, her arms and up-drawn legs, were a tight cage around the canary of her heart. It was still beating. It fluttered, then started as the car stopped. The headlights creamed the lounge-blinds. The light clicked out as a door opened, with the sound of another being slammed shut. A second slam followed and, hot after that, speech. 'You stupid bitch. It's one rule for you, like, and another'' 'Oh yeah. One rule. You need your rules don't you, sweetheart, like the rule of your fists.' 'You can talk,' the male voice muttered. They were at the door, in a new silence drowned in drink. Amy looked over to the opened-up hallway and, left of it, the stairs. The babysitter was up there, in Amy's bed, with the boy who had a green car the same colour as Granny's curtains. The car that made the same noise as Granny's throat, after her cigarettes. 'You can talk,' Uncle Chris was saying, tone pitching up masculine, then feminine, on waves of inebriation. He seemed to be trying to find his voice. 'You can talk, yeah right, the times you've hit me.' 'Ooooh, you poor lad. Hit by a women, eh? How do you get by? Big strong man like you.' Her Mam''s words turned, instinctive as a snake under the edge of a knife. 'Little wimp. Little wife-beating fucking wimp.' Uncle Chris was finding his keys. They crankled rather than tinkled under his fingertips. Amy's bedroom door came open, whispering light and words down the well of the staircase, 'Quick, quick, get em on man , they're back.' 'Alreet, keep your fanny hair on.' 'Shut it right. I get twenty quid for this. I'm not blowing it cause you can't find your dick and put it in your pants.' The front door opened. 'Oh, hello love.' Mam, smiling wide as the fattest lie, came through it. 'How are you? Have a good night?' 'Aye.' A pause, nakedly selfconscious. 'Was just checking on the bairn.' 'But,' Mam turned her head. 'She's", "label": 1}
{"text": "right here.' 'Oh' yeah.' Silence, then, to break it; 'Jesus you are an empty headed bairn.' Mam laughed at the baby-sitter. 'I could clean the house with the cloth in her head. She's a funny un, alreet. You never know where she's snuck off to. What you doing behind the curtain, love?' The baby-sitter laughed. 'Aye.' 'I'll stick the light on. Would you like a brew love?' 'Or something stronger,' said Uncle Chris, squeezing by. 'Give your Mam a cuddle.' Amy's brain numbed, going to Mexico, and ordering a tequila, as Uncle Chris would say. He was in the next room. At her words, Amy's skin puckered into a disease of kisses that made her think of May Day, and of ribbons. Her Mam was watching QuizMaster and texting answers while exclaiming 'it's a fucking fix' and leaning forward more intent with every 'fucking'. She drank Southern Comfort and appeared to feel none of it. Amy didn't like it when she drank; she would want to be comforted. 'Come on, sweetheart.' Her Mam's voice remained soft, beseeching as her fingers coaxed the air, and not the girl's skin. Amy sat down on the settee and allowed her mother to pull her close, in under her armpit. She could feel her Mam's skin where it was peppered with hair yet to grow, yet to be razored. 'What do you think the answer is, pet?' Amy shook her head. Her mouth did not move. She tried to appear tired, stretching and yawning. She would pretend to drift off, as soon as the going got good. Uncle Chris sat down on the armchair, eyes pinioned on the T.V and its faux-rock surround, like a climber who was scared of losing his grip. 'Ignore Uncle Chris, he's in a little boy's sulk,' her Mam sneered. 'Bitch,' Chris said, almost to himelf. 'Aren't you?' She said. Amy's mother was watching the screen. Amy tried not to. In the dark parches around the whirligig of colours, and text numbers, she could see a reflection. It was of a Witch. The T.V was her crystal-ball. 'Yeah, that's right,' said Chris, drinking and spilling. The sentences dribbled out. 'Sit with the bairn. That way, you're safe.' Amy's mother lent to the right. 'That help, sweeteheart? Give you a bit of a chance. Think you could hit?' Amy closed her eyes. She had seen Aidan, in the borders of the screen. 'Good try Matt, mate,' the T.V. said, somewhere in the space between her mother's chin and Chris' fists. 'But the wroooooong answer. Come on people, hit the dial pad, the jackpot's up to six grand. Think what you could with that. What would you do with that, Charlotte?' A woman laughed, high pitched, excited. 'You'd like that wouldn't you?' said Uncle Chris. His feet could be heard striding across the carpet, and out of the room. 'No, I'd like you to act like a man, for a change.' 'Always got to have the last word, don't you?' 'No, you do.' 'No, you bloody do.' His footsteps were on the stairs. His voice was with them. 'Prat!' yelled her Mam, cocking her head backward. Her neck clicked like the loading of a gun. The footsteps ceased. Then, resumed. 'Wimp!' The footsteps returned in a rush. Amy's mother tensed, stood, and hurried to the door. She was shouting as he reached it. Amy closed her mind, and didn't listen. Her Mam's lips curled all the way around her teeth, whirlpooling the words that came form her mouth. Her back was arched, but so was her arms, and at the end of them her hands had formed into downward facing claws. She looked to be dowsing. Uncle Chris came through the door chest first. His shoulders rolled as he threw his arms, wrist first, up and at Mam's abdomen. His face was a snarl of red, and a rictus of shadows. Whatever was going on behind it had frozen his cheek muscles. The sound came back in, for Amy. 'You fucking want this, don't you? You fucking want this you sick bitch?' he said. His eyes seemed to have bubbled up to the surface. Amy thought they might pop. 'Want what?' she shoved back, taking care to claw his arm and drawing where she had been in red lines under his elbow. 'You're too pathetic to beat me. Call yourself a fucking man? Sitting in this room all day long. Or playing with yourself and thinking about me. You pathetic little shite.' She twisted down to the settee, grasped the remote control and threw it at his face. There was a clack as it chipped on his teeth. Uncle Chris screamed and bent. He hissed through his toothline and spittle tentacled to the carpet. 'You bitch,' he spat, again, and looked at his hand for blood. His eyes bulged all the more, as though daring the red. 'Oh, hurt by a little woman, were you? You prat! I should get myself a real man, and not a useless little prick like you.' 'Oh,' he breathed, still bent over, 'like that boy that was here just now. You were all over him, you soused bint. You know the looks he was giving his girlfriend?' Amy backed across the lounge carpet as her mother turned to her. She wasn't loking at her. She grabbed an ornament off the wall ' a flying duck ' and threw it at Uncle Chris. It missed. The ducks, though, flew in a flock of three and she clutched the next. He ran at her, and the duck soared over his head, sprawling against the uplighter, swinging it before falling to the floor. Shadows swarmed and scattered below the light like cockroaches. Among them, Amy saw a Witch. The T.V. said, 'Well, that's amazing.' Uncle Chris reached her mother, slamming her against the fire. It clanked and listed. His hands reached for her throat and closed. He didn't say anything, the words he wanted to speak swarming around", "label": 1}
{"text": "his facial muscles as an alien would in a chest. He was bleeding, now, from his upper lip. Mam bit his right hand, and the fingers shied away. 'Can't even kill me right,' she said. 'I need a real man. A real man like Mikey.' The hand closed back in. His gaze locked down on her eyes. He lent his slight weight against hers. Her hands skittered across his skin, but left no indentations. Amy ran to the telephone. She didn't like the telephone and her fingers internally recoiled as she picked up the receiver. It felt of plastic and fake voices. She put a finger to the dialling pad. 'I'll phone the police,' she said. She closed her eyes, and said it again. 'I'll the phone the police.' Although why she did, she was unsure. It felt like the kind of thing people would say, on an occasion such as this. Her Mam's breath came louder, racheting her throat. Amy imagined her pretty, thin lips opening. She could hear the sound of Uncle Chris crying. 'Get off me,' her Mam said, and there was the sound of a shove, the exclamation of carpet under a foot that didn't know it was about to move. Her Mam's footsteps went past as the phone said, 'Put the phone down and redial.' Her Mam could be heard, ascending the stairs. Chris, unbeknowdst to Amy, had silently sunk into the sofa, his eyes staring at her eight year old face. After a pause, Amy opened her eyes. The man on the television screen was pointing at a T.V set covered in ribbons. In its picture, the man was pointing at a T.V. this one, however, showed a toddler, in a cot made, it appeared, of rot, of things that used to be fabric, but had gone green, and decayed. The little boy was crying. The little boy had blue eyes. Amy stood and fled uptairs, not stopping until she reached her bedroom. Carrying the sketchbook under her arnmpit, Amy shut the door and walked across the carpet. The light was still on, and her duvet was cratered by the impact of buttocks, elbows, feet, from where the babysitter and her boyfriend had lain. They hadn't bothered taking up the duvet, or getting under it. Amy could smell something high and floral, like the hedge on the left of the garden in midsummer, when it flowered and leaked liquid from its petals. It smelt of Piglet's home. Barney had been strewn across the room. His eyes were glazed and stared at the ceiling. Arms vacant with exhaustion, Amy gathered her bear back together and sat, crosslegged as ever, on her bed, sewing the limb to its shoulder. Her hand felt like a clutch of thick needles. It was all she could do to keep her eyelids pinned open. She sewed, stich after stich, until it was done, opened her sketchpad, and turned to the thick, creamy-beige page that contained the Latter Wood. Rising with zombified precision ' all straightnesses of limb ' she turned to her school uniform, took three lanurnum seeds from her dress pocket and popped them like sleeping tablets. Equally efficient, she then switched off the light, returned to bed, cuddled her teddy bear, held his hand, and fell sideways through sleep and to someplace beyond it. The Latter Wood had the odour of broken fur and spilled blood and, not too far off, of death. In this way, and certainly not in the clumsy, shambling, fern-breaking way in which he walked, Barnaby blended in. The red and green and gold of yellow had been blacked out by the night. All colour seemed, like a Blitz window, to be afraid of the sky. Strange things had passed above. Barnaby tried to think about these, and managed, his mind trailing off in fits and spurts, not unlike the paths in the Latter Wood. The undergrowth closed in, or that may have been the framing of unconsciounes. He was powerfully bloodied, and by his own arteries. Following the crumbs of his consciousness that stretched out before him, along the forest floor, Barney closed in on the school. He could hear her laugh. There was something about a Witch's laugh- it was a cold as her tit yet as wet as her crotch. Barnaby shivered. The crumb of his conciousnes were spacing out. Pretty soon, he couldn't see the next one. He fell. When he came to, he crawled forward. Twigs crackled beneath hm. He blacked out. Came to and spat bile and blood and crawled once more. The laburnum pods above him reached down, seeds bleached by the third white moon that had risen in the East and shed light beneath the foliage and cover of the canopy. Barnaby hadn't seen this moon before, and wondered what it portended. The moonshafts looked like knuckle bones, on an intricate hand. Death would have a hand like that, Barnaby thought, and crawled. His head was swollen and numb and filled with frostbitten thoughts. Barnaby laughed - he was unsure why - and sent a hiccup-cloud of moquittos into the warm, cozy space beneath the trees. He could just stay here, he thought, let down his snout, press his muzzle and wet nose to the forest floor, and let go, as his shoulder had let go of hi right arm. He could, if not for the girl. She had left him here to guard her Baby. He was going on a human hunt, and he was more than a little bit scared. Barnaby rose to his haunches, then to his feet. He blundered into a tree. Pods fell in a squall. 'Sorry,' he said. There was a tingling at his shoulder joint, as if someone had walked across the grave of his lost limb. He stared at it. The limb was no longer lost. He flexed his paw. 'You fixed me,' he said, to himself. He stared at his right arm, a blob of dark brown", "label": 1}
{"text": "huffing in a you-should-have-got-dressed-quicker sort of way. Aimee got down and stared up at Barnaby. In the diseased light he looked nothing like the teddy bear who slept in her bed. 'Thank you, Barnaby. I'll tell the teachers it was my fault, I promise. You won't get into trouble.' Barnaby smiled wide enough, Aimee thought, to accidentally swallow a little girl. 'I'll go the rest of the way on my own,' she said. 'I'm safe here. The gates aren't far away.' 'Yes.' Barnaby cast his eyes at the heavens and caught a light Aimee could not see, glinting pure white in the black centre of their beads. In the South, beyond the growing moon and the canopy behind them, the Wishing, Wanting and Needing stars would be twinkling at each other. 'Have a good night.' Aimee did not answer. She was walking away, her delicate, truncated stride (as though she dared not open her legs too wide) picking its way over snaggle-toothed thorns and splattering, secretive brooks. Aimee stopped, looking up. She could see the Night School gates. They were thin, filigree, magical, iron and tall. She could not see their tops, nor the gargoyles who sat, discomforted, on their spikes. They had to be high, to keep out the Witch on her broomstick. Aimee stared beyond them to the moon, which seemed caught between their barbs. It bled moonshine and the lunar curve went on beyond sight, like a breast to a newborn's eye. 'Cold as a witch's tit,' said Aimee, her breath floating away in a haze. It was the kind of thing her mother would say, which Aimee thought was strange, because her Mam's breasts were not cold at all. What Aimee did not think strange, what both Aimee and Amy thought entirely natural, was that, in this world, her mother was the Witch. Glancing skyward, her skin bumping as if it had a thousand moons to rise, Aimee ran to the gates and, when they finally opened, through them. At the end of the night, the bear took Aimee's hand and Amy fell upward into her bed. Facing the artexed ceiling, Amy opened her eyes and breathed, taking in the unwashed towel on the radiator, the odour of her mother on the linen, the smell of alcohol-dipped fingers on her chest and belly. The morning light made yellow yawns on the wall. She was plain seven-year-old Amy again, and the waking knowledge of it left her feeling ugly. Her pyjamas formed a second skin, sweated to her first as though she'd been running. Now that Barney was no longer holding her hand, she recoiled her fingers, limbering them in, bringing them up to the bridge of her nose. She loved her nose. Mam said she didn't get it from her side of the family: too gangly, too obvious, and good for nothing other than smelling, just like, she said, Amy. It was her father's nose. Her cheeks, beside it, were sallow, deflated from any untoward expectation, and had none of the baby-fat of Aimee's. The twilight-lilac dress and Dorothy-red shoes were gone, vanished into the thick air of the bedroom. Amy rolled back to face Barney. Behind his head the thin, blue wallpaper was scarred by the seventies, floral design beneath it. The original lining made white and broken kiss marks on the blue; the mouths of monsters trying to get through from another world. Of anyone, Amy knew other worlds were back there, clustered close, leaning in. The breathing of them was audible, when Amy pressed an ear to the wall. She hoped the monsters wouldn't get through. In the shadowed corner of the bed, where she had sequestered him, Barney sat, tilting, angled, it seemed, to fall. In this world, his face had expression, but just one, and Amy could tell what the teddy was feeling only by cuddling him. Only by holding his paw could she travel to other worlds, and ask him outright. She cuddled him now, squirming out lines of her limbs through the bed linen, careful not to hold hands. It was nearly time for Day School, and no time to travel to the places she had been. Amy rubbed her feet together, not so much massaging in warmth as bodily contact. She made monkey hands at the back of Barney, gripping herself, pretending that one hand did not know the other, or why it cared enough to carress. In spasms, her skull filled with the sensation of fingers; tremours of delicious, gluttonous touch. She let the feeling twist under her scalp, and careered her hair around the pillow, scratching itches that did not exist. Barney was happy, she could tell. 'What time do you call this, you lazy shite?' Amy stilled. At the sound of her mother, something in her froze, and some of her ran away. The teddy bear bunched with anger. 'How many times do I have to tell you to get up?' Her Mam was beside Amy's bed. She could move quickly, her Mam, even when she was drunk. Faster, when she was hungover. 'Shit and shite, girl, have you looked at this room? How many times have I told you to clear this up? It's disgusting. I can't take it anymore. I'm going to go through this pigsty today and throw away everything.' She clutched Amy by her wrist. 'Even your smelly bear. Especially that bloody bear. Let go of it ' right now - and get up!' Amy stood at the front of the house, in the tight, coffiny porch. The morning had been a series of Polaroid Stills. Clothing herself. Dressing Aidan. Putting poison in Aidan's cereal. Cleaning his teeth. Stay still. Smile. Please don't throw Barney away. Please don't throw my teddy bear away, Amy thought, but did not say. She smiled as her Mam looked down. 'Have you got clean tissues, love? Are they clean?' Her mother said, in the voice she used at school. Her Mam put on its sound", "label": 1}
{"text": "on grey black in the dark. 'You fixed me,' he said, and began to run. The Witch stood in the centre of the nursery. Angel hissed and inched closer, gripping his knife. Though the sand table was empty and upended, the Witch had sand on the end of her stilletos. Angel didn't know where it was from but, despite only coming up to her breast, height-wise, he wasn't staring at her feet, but at the little boy. She held a broom in her other hand, and Angel ignored this. The Witch grinned sweetly at him and, Amy's little brother hanging from the angle of her elbow to her wide hip, turned the key at the right of the wide window. The metal shutters on its other side jarred and rose upward. Behind Angel, there were the sounds of gorillas and teachers fighting, and the screams of small children. Ms Lydia lay - beaten by gorilla fists - 'guarding' the entrance to the quiet room. Inside, the remaining four year olds could be heard screaming or, where they had screamed themselves dry, hoarsely sobbing. Ms Lydia's mouth was open as though trying to join in. 'Let him go,' said the eleven year old boy. His teeth were gritted and felt as intransient as the serrations on the knife. Sweat buttered its grip. 'He's mine,' said the Witch. She held the azure-robed boy against the curve of his bosom. The child had gone quiet, his eyes wide and glinting as he eyed the Witch, then Angel. 'You won't take him,' said Angel and lunged. The Witch dropped the child and Angel's lunge went from his knife to his sight. The blade faltered as he watched the little boy plummet. Angel gasped. His left foot slipped to the side. There was a doughy crack as the small boy slapped against the tiles. He began to wail. Angel's thrust came up short and the Witch said, 'You made me do that.' Angel looked up, open mouthed as Ms Lydia would be from now onward. The Witch, as he gaped at her, swung her broom stick through the air, the shaft of it striking his right temple. There was a fizz like ginger ale inside his skull and he fell, as Amy's brother had, but when he hit the ground, he didn't scream, but passed out. He knew no more, the Witch using his knife to stab him in the throat. The boy, while unconscious, bled to death. . Aimee passed the staff room, her feet on their tiptoes from running flat out, her eyes straining down the corridor ahead of her. She saw Barnaby, caught amidst a tangle of gorillas in the dining hall, but didn't see several of the teaching staff as they fought a Russian Doll. She slammed through the door out of the canteen along one corridor, then through another. Unnoticed behind her, the Bear followed, nettled amid a melee of apes. The nursery loomed, both its safety rail and its entrance unlocked and wedged open, which it would never be, she thought. It was against Health and Safety, with small children. Someone could just walk right in and take one. When she raced into the nursery, she knew someone had. The door to the playground was adjar, the shutters up, and her brother was gone. There was a screech as a gorilla impacted against the laminated display behind her and to the right, and a scattering of construction bricks as it fitted on the floor, its spine severed. The bear roared as he mauled his way toward Aimee, but she heard neither this nor the screech, as she sank to sit, legs sideways, on the green, story-telling carpet. High in the glassy night were the stars. The Witch flew amongst them, casting a shadow as much upwards as down. Tell it, her mind said, as so often it did but, as ever, refused to go any further. 'Tell it,' she said. Up there, nothing heard her but the alien cold, and that wasn't telling. Her Dark Tower Block approached and inside, in her room, a cot waited. In her arms lay a toddler, seemingly asleep, but strangely listless. The Witch giggled. Her inner child wanted to play with it. Her adult wanted to join in. Part 3 Chapter 1 IN WHICH AMY SUFFERS FROM PSYCHOTIC EPISODES, MANIC-DEPRESSION, AND INSOMNIA The bear had fought like a wild animal; blood welting from his wounds to redden the mist of his rage. He had shanked to the right, the stench of his pelt following him, and thrashed his claws through the edge of the gorilla's wings. Thin, ethereal, they ripped, and the ape had bellowed, not bothering to strike at its chest as it drove at Barnaby, knocking the air from his gut, careening the brown bear back, against the wall of the school reception. There had been the intimate sound of glass smashing on his skull, and the clean, clinical crinkle of the exposed shards of it. The ape had grasped Barnaby's head, and the bear had chewed long gashes of grey and black - then red - flesh from its forearm. The Witch's minion hadn't let go, but had pushed the bear's right eye down toward the toothy grin of broken glass. From the corner of his sight, Barnaby saw a folder, and a sign on it reading, 'Visitors Sign In Here'. His eyes couldn't catch a glimpse of the broken glass, but Barnaby had known it was there, too close ' too fuzzy ' to properly see. It had been clear in the gorilla's eyes, as pure expectation. Reaching out, Barnaby had taken a fistful of the gorilla's faery wing and, with a final spin, brought its bulk down, via his flank, and onto what remained of the window. The ape's head had juddered, but not too much, as it was speared on the glass. The remaining wing had flapped all the more, making a sound more like a death", "label": 1}
{"text": "splutter, than a death rattle, and then, waspish, closed around the ape's body, as it stilled, and became a corpse. Barnaby hadn't stopped to feed, but had loped down the hallway that separated the reception from the dining room and, from there, the nursery. At that point, Aimee had run right past him. Aimee sank hollow-mouthed to the floor. There was nothing to say, not now, and no use in her having a tongue to say it. Even her sharp, raggedy breathing was nonsense to her, foreign as swearing in Finnish, 'I'm not going to see the wizard.' 'I'm not going to see the wizard.' Someone was saying. 'The wizard of oz.' She realised it was her, that she was singing, but brokenly as the garoyles' mouths, in the playground. The lantern lights caught her in their luminesence. She existed, the lights maintained, her and her shadow. The shadows had sharp edges. They were solid; they were sure. Aimee felt less so. The tables had snapped legs and bowed, dispirited. The sandpaper alphabet could be seen, strewn around. The 'z' had gone mssing along with a child. All Aimee could care about was Aiden, but, then, she had failed to care for him. The water table was overflowing with blood. The body of a snake had been dumped there. Too weak to rise, as it drowned. Its thrashing had sent splash marks to the ceiling. Aimee would have thought it was Angel's guardian, but her head was no place for thinking. A line of lava hung from the edge of the magma area, gunging up and down as it spewed onto the tiles. Aimee closed her eyes on her crying and her eyelids rapidly filled. Piglet ran a trotter through his curly hair. The bear lay slumped beside his ward. By the looks of the smashed cabinets and sharded shelving, he had used the nursery to fend off the attacks of the three gorillas that lay against the walls. One was still breathing and didn't look like it wanted to be. Barnaby had, Piglet assumed, inserted the Barbie doll into its ribcage. The small porcine creature wasn't related to the sidekick of Winnie the Poo. Firstly, he was rather different in appearance, wearing, as he did, a Hawaiian Shirt the hue of a Hawaiian Pizza that had been eaten, then vomitd. He also wore y-fronts, disconterningly stained yellow. Then there was, of course, his habits. Piglet ran his trotter through his hair, lit a cigarette and wondered what to do next. He was immensely strong, a trait he may or may not have shared with Milne's creation, as the earlier incarnation never had a fist fight on which to judge. Piglet had been involved in several, particularly when drunk. Less, when high. He dowsed the cigarette in a pool of blood, bent, grasped the bear's right, hind leg between his left trotter and his Hawaain shirt, and the girl's red-shoed limb between right trotter and the same shirt, and began to drag both out of the school. Though sweating, it was not lost on Piglet that his strength was quite supernatural. Considering this (and whether he should rename himself Superpiglet), he pulled the comatose human and the comatose bear down the steps from the nursery (the bear's head hitting those steps with a thunk) and decided this was down to his seven a day habit. All the masturbation must strengthen his muscles. It stood to reason. Piglet dragged the bear and girl through the Latter Wood until he reached the Christian's hut. He didn't know where else to take them, until they recovered. He had considered his own under-tree home, but it was an embarrassing mess, and not entirely suitable for a young girl, and, besides, the Christian had herbs and such-like, and these would help them heal. 'Bloody' hell.' Grunting and snorting, Piglet backed through the door of the hut, jamming it open on its hinges, with his hips. With some effort, he hefted the two unconscious creatures onto the table in the centre of the room. The Christian still lay on the floor with insence sticks in his eyes, and, caked in fleas and a growing clothing of larvae, was beginning to smell. 'Got to do something about that,' Piglet muttered to himself. He thought of how, bent and pulled the insence sticks from the corpse's eyes, re-inserted it the right way up, and lit them. 'Good thinking,' he said, with appreciation. Piglet surveyed the hut, hands linked in his y-fromts. He scratched his genitals and farted. This normally helped him to think and did the trick, this time. 'Ah,' he said, when he could be heard over the sound of flatulence. In a spot on the right of the toilet-curtain, there was a bluish white powder he'd seen the Christian use to cauterise Barnaby's wounds. Grasping a trotter full he approached the Bear. 'This should bring you round,' he said, and massaged it in, where the its pelt was torn. With a roar that rolled the bear's own eyes, Barnaby sat straight up on the table. His fangs bit into his lower lip as his skin began to steam. 'That worked well,' said Piglet. His jaunty tone was on a quite different pitch from the bear's scream. Barnaby turned to face the piglet. His eyes first filled with rage before they filled with vacancy, as he passed out once more, and fell back against the table. The hut juddered. 'Maybe not,' said Piglet, and decided to wait in the toilet. That way, if he thought a lot, he wouldn't make a mess. The cabin door reeled before him with a creak and swung back as Barnaby stumbled onto the porch. It ' the door ' looked drunk. The bear wiped the back of a paw across his forehead. Under the fur, he felt liquid. Sweat, he realised. On the porch's step sat a piglet who was smoking what looked and smelt to be a joint. The small", "label": 1}
{"text": "pig rolled its head back over its shoulders and stared up at the swaying bear and giggled. The piglet seemed to be high. 'Dear Witch, you look like you've been in a bee hive,' said Piglet. 'Shut up, or I'll step on your neck,' said Barnaby. Instead, he sat beside him on the step, which creaked. 'Oh, my head,' he added. Piglet took a draw and offered it to Barnaby, who shook his head. 'Don't like it,' he growled. 'Whitie much?' said Piglet. Barnaby shrugged, releasing an odour from his armpits which made him wish he'd said 'Whatever,' instead. The small pig smoked in silence before raising the tight knub of light into the night air. 'Have you ever connected all the dots in the sky,' he said, moving the joint erratically across the constellations above them. 'See what words it makes. Could be a message. God's shopping list, maybe' Maybe an apology.' Barnaby released a long breath. 'Nope,' he said, at the end of it. 'Don't believe in God.' Piglet took a puff. 'Doesn't say anything,' he said. 'Just meaningless scribbles.' He giggled, but the sound of it was forlorn. Barnaby felt like shrugging, but didn't, unsure if his head could take it. The bear sat and the piglet reclined in silence before Barnaby bent forward and rose. He staggered back throught he cabin door, and into the gloom that hung about Aimee. She didn't move. She wasn't asleep. He drew himself up to crouch beside her. He touched her forehead, a pale, small slab of meat in the half-light. It was pallid and moist. 'Aimee,' he said. 'Time to go home,' he said. His paw stroked down her shoulder to her arm but went no further. He couldn't send her back ' not like this. 'I'm sorry Aimee,' he said. He held her forearm, careful not to nick her with his claws. She didn't respond and, to fill the silence, he began to softly sing. It was, he knew, one of her favourite songs, and she had sung it before, many times, just holding Barney. 'Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high,' he sang, 'there's a land that I heard of, once in a lullaby. Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue, and the dreams that you dare to dream, really do come true.' He whistled once, as though a bird, and the hut fell again into silence. Barnaby found he couldn't finish the song and simply sat, holding her arm, instead. The rain had welled up outside until it was a downpour, the forest floor a frothing, rabid place where mud went to drown. Barnaby stood on the dead Christian's porch and watched the rain fall, staring across to the shadows under the Laburnum trees at the South end of the glade. There, in an unmarked grave, lay the Christian. Barnaby stared. The water fell infront of his face, and behind, through the leaks in a roof that had seen better days. Yesterday, thought Bear. It hadn't been raining yesterday. He turned (slow because he didn't want to turn) and opened the door to the shack, and entered the darkness. The dark dribbled, and Bear could see intermittent spots of light in the corners of the room. The leaks were winking and weeping. Where the rain came in, it quickly left, via cracks in the floorboards. The table had been made up into a bed, using shredded linen from the school nursery, and various articles of unwashed clothing from Piglet's hut. The air did not smell good, and Piglet's y-fronts probably didn't help, though Barnaby was unwilling to investigate. Aimee didn't seem to care. She shifted uneasily as Barnaby entered the room. She was awake. The little light that occupied the Christian's hut glowed in her eyes, as it would in a cat's. She was staring at the ceiling. Despite the holes, it was robed in shadow, though that didn't seem to bother Aimee's eyes, and she didn't appear to see what was before her eyes. Even here, even in an imaginary, world, she was off with the nymphs. She was off with the Witch. Or, more precisely, she was staring, staring, bending her entire sight to see the little boy who had been taken by then Witch, or so the Bear guessed. Her baby. 'How are you feeling?' said Barnaby. As ever, she didn't reply. He was only glad she still went to the toilet. 'Come on girl,' he had said, in the intervening time. 'Up and at them' You won't find your brother this way' You have to go back home, to your world' The human mind can't stand this much escapism; you'll go mad.' The words had done little, though, bar measuring out the elongating intervals of her disconnection. She had begun by saying 'no', over and over, before working up to a strange, ashamed, half choked moan, then to tense shifts of her abdomen, and finally to this - utter catatonia. Barnaby was scared her mind had broken. The darkness and the stench in the hut drew together, thickening like a sauce over heat. The raindrops kept falling, and the cracks in the roof got wider. After a moment, Barnaby could no longer stand in the hut, not even to cuddle her, not even to sing, and left, shutting the door behind him. 'Ah, this is the life,' said the Long Worm. 'Oh, Witch, yes, beautiful weather,' said the Notsolong Worm, squirming as he did so, happy as a pig in mud. 'Funny, you know, these storms coming.' 'Why?' said the Notsolong Worm, laying back. If he had arms to rest behind his head, he would have used them, and elbows to spread to the sides of its ears. 'Well, people say these storms are a bad omen. Like something bad is going to happen.' 'You're crazy, Long Worm.' The Long Worm didn't so much bristle as constrict and the Notsolong Worm remembered the pecking order of things; that worms should respect their", "label": 1}
{"text": "elders. After all, he had no way of knowing if he might be made from the tail of the Long Worm. That would be embarrassing, he thought. 'I'm sorry,' said the Notsolong Worm, after a pause. 'I mean ' storms are a good thing. Good things happen when storms happen. Like rain' and' more rain.' The Notsolong worm could have been smiling; it was difficult to tell, what with his segments. 'Yes,' said the Long Worm. 'But things aren't the way they used to be. Take birds, for instance. They don't know their place, anymore, you know ' in the natural scheme of things.' 'Peck you to death.' The Long Worm nodded absently. 'And things are just, you know, thinning.' The Nosolong Worm sat up, with a start. 'Yes! Yes! Just the other day I was tunnelling around, only a few feet down, under the Wood, and guess what...' '' You came through the other side.' 'Yep,' said the Notsolong Worm. 'The world just came to an end.' 'You know why'' said the Long Worm, in a tone that indicated he hoped he didn't. The Notsolong Worm shrugged with his lower body. 'Kids,' said the Long Worm. 'Yes! Pissing on the ground and pretending it's rain. Disgusting.' The Long Worm stared at him in disgust, his tail curling like a lip. 'What? Are you nuts? No! Kids don't have belief, these days. They don't believe in this world. It's all this liberal teaching, you know. Laisez Faire, and all that. Teaches them to think. I ask you ' who wants a thinking kid?' 'I don't even want a talking kid.' The Long Worm stared at him, in much the same way as he had before. 'They think. They doubt. They don't believe. Next thing that happens ' they get all depressed and start to figuring that this world doesn't exist at all. That there isn't that, you know, magic in the air. That worms don't talk.' 'That bears don't shit in the Wood.' The Long Worm ignored him. 'And when they don't believe. Well, let me tell you something about not believing. When you don't believe in something, that something Just Stops Working. You know?' The Notsolong Worm nodded although, really, he didn't. 'Enjoy the rain, I say'' said the Long Worm. '' while you can. Because it'll be sunny days from now onward. You mark my words. Endless, bloody sun.' People made the mistake of thinking the country a good place to live. Particularly human people. In reality, it was a rumour mill and, here, in the Latter Wood, it was doubly so. It ground its inhabitant into constituent parts, analysed them, and spat them out. Even the squirrels bitched about each other. Who had the most nuts. Who had the smallest. So it was that Piglet knew Bear was still at the Christian's hut. Not wanting to waste his remaining nicotine, Piglet circled the shack once, before knocking on its ashen door. Approaching this, he dropped the fag end in a hole that he quickly realised was a footprint. Piglet stared at it. The footprint didn't move. It sat still, drooling a little at the edges, where the rain had gotten in. 'Oh,' said Piglet. 'You're a footprint.' Perhaps it was the primordial dark, in the centre of the Latter Wood, but the print appeared to shrug. 'What of it?' Piglet said. 'Well' what, is the question, that made it, and what is what made it made of, is the other question.' Piglet did not like to ask himself this, and so didn't. It sounded complicated. He traced the footprints. Tracked, he would have said. 'Somebody is walking around The Christian's hut,' he said, to himself. He arrived back at the front door. He couldn't help but notice that he was sweating. A line of it ran into his eye, stinging him. The bees on his floral shirt looked frightened. Piglet clutched his penis, in order to steady the shaking of his fingers, as he knocked. 'Ho hum,' he hummed to himelf, and tried to think about buggery, but nothing came to mind. He knocked again, meaning to do so three times, but doing so seven times in a stutter of a tiny trotter, before the door stopped him, by moving. 'Oh, Bear,' said Piglet. He could have cried out with joy, and took the opportunity to do so. 'Oh, Bear!' 'What is it Piglet?' Barnaby sounded weary. 'Oh, Bear. There's a monster in the wood.' 'What kind of monter?' Bear's voice smelt of fish. 'I don't know.' He squinted up from between his sweaty, curly fringe. 'But it's got feet,' he whispered. 'And that type of monster is more dangerous than the ones without feet. Please help me, pleae,'said Piglet, trying to roll a roll up. He littered the doorstep with tiny, abandoned leaves. 'Okay,' said Barnaby. He ducked under the door's lintel and stepped out from the light. 'Look, look,' said Piglet. He lit his deflated roll up and proffered the light of it to the ground. The footprint took on a brimstone appearance. 'See' See?' The Bear did not reply. They circled the hut. 'Oh my God,' said Piglet. He stared at Barnaby. The cigarette shivered in his grip, making the light twitch. 'There's more of them. Another monster has come.' 'Mmmmm,' said Barnaby. He was smiling. Piglet could see long fangs. He didn't like them, or it, in general. 'So, let me get this straight,' said the Bear. 'You walked round the hut. Then, you noticed there were footprints going round the hut. And now, having walked round the hut again, you've spotted another pair of prints.' 'Yes,' Piglet could barely say it. But managed, and felt proud, so he did it again. 'Yes,' he said. 'Well, Piglet. I think I know exactly what the monster is.' 'Oh.' Piglet went quiet. His ears tried to draw in. They were open enough, though, to hear the spittle of a mouth trying to chew its own", "label": 1}
{"text": "chin- trying ever so hard, and then the parting of leaves. 'It's one of them,' Piglet said, pointing a trotter. 'It's a Russian Doll.' An aged lady stood where a parting of leaves had been. She went as far sideways as she did tallways, with a dress that was lilac or mauve. It was hard to tell, in the lack of light. Her hands, with fingers that seemed too wide for the knuckles, rested uneasily infront of her girth, as though longing to smoke a cigarette or pick at food. She wheezed at the Bear and the small pig, and stared through wide, thick glasses with rims the same dishwater colour as her hair. She had the look of a granny dragged backward through a bush. The thick lenses gave her the impression of teariness, but perhaps she was crying, thought Piglet, because her lower lip was hanging by a string of flesh. 'What's wrong with her mouth?' said Piglet. 'Don't speak,' said Bear. 'My mouth, dear?' The old lady's mouth sounded perfectly normal, for an old lady, despite the lip. She raised a clutch of the thick-girthed fingers up, and pushed the lip into the small, wet hole above it. 'Nothing wrong with my mouth, dear little pig, it tastes quite lovely.' She pulled what she had been chewing from between teeth. The canines were small but overly sharp. The lip had burst, like a salted slug. 'Would you like a nibble?' she said. 'No,' said Piglet, before he could think, Don't Say No. 'Stand behind me,' said Barnaby. While Piglet was still thinking 'say', the large,. brown bear thrusted his small, pink body to stand, shivering behind the crook of a shaggy right knee. Piglet peered around the leg. 'We haven't come for the girl, you know Bear, we've come for you.' Piglet could see her gum, now, as she spoke, she was still sucking on her lip and it was unravelling into her mouth as though the loose end of a sweater. The threads started to eat out her cheek, revealing the juncture of jaw beyond. The bear lowered for a fight, hunkering his abdomen down, his bottom pressing on Piglet's head. The pig shifted, but not far. 'You can't fight us, Bear. There's so many of us, in here, look.' The granny tore open her dress, then her bra, revealing large breasts that had thinned to insultion above her belly. Using fingers that were already moist from her mouth, she wormed the entire hand into the place where her sternum should have been. The violation made a suckling sound, entirely unlike bone being cracked, even as she jacked her ribcage apart. Inside her chest, Piglet saw faces. They were all grinning, and licking their lips. He didn't know how many faces, and didn't bother to count, as one of them ripped out its eyes, ate it, and revealed another eye, with another coloured iris, directly below. Now, Piglet could see why they were called Russian Dolls. Laughing, the granny said, 'I really like this bit. It tastes scrumptious,' while she ripped flaccid lines from her breast, and uncovered, as if by archaeology, a nose. It sniffed, and wrinkled around the nostrils, possibly in distaste. The little aged lady gave herself a mastectomy, and licked the area around where her lips had been. Her teeth looked sharp and longer, now. Barnaby said, 'I will fight.' 'Okay dear, if that's what you want.' She reached into the cave of her chest, much larger than a cavity had any right to be, and tore off a strip of male face inside. 'That's my daddy,' she said. As she ate his flesh, her teeth ground. 'He always was a bitter little man. Oh, don't fret, little pig. You should see what he did to my flesh, when I was little.' The Bear didn't reply. Piglet was backing away, through the puddles, leaving footprints of mud. They looked giilty and as teary as the granny's eyes. His heart was swelling with revulsion. Chewing nonchalantly, the little, old woman, who was now a little less chubby, launched at the bear. Barnaby leant to the side, his right paw branching back, brown and wet, and striking at her as she closed. There was the rip of dress and skin as his claws bit in. This didn't seem to help, as a set of arms birthed from the rended wounds. There was no blood, but the old woman was sprouting limbs, and they grappled around the bear's pelt. Roaring in pain, the bear started to do what the woman would not - to bleed. He went to the wet forest floor, sending out rainwater and blood in fronds. Neither made any sound. Piglet's feet were noisless in the footprints they made. He could hear his own breathing. He could hear the Bear's screaming. He could hear the sound of the granny chattering, like she was discussing the weather or Bingo, and more mouths clamped down on the bear, taking parts of him. Barnaby was losing, both his hide and the fight. His left arm flailed, and tore away an arm that had emerged from the overhang of the Doll's right flank. It was replaced by another - this one suited in black. A gentleman's pallid hand pinched at the bear. 'Don't worry, Daddy,' said the granny, reffering to the disconnected arm, or so Piglet supposed, 'I'll eat you later.' 'No,' said Piglet, forgetting his promise not to talk. He was trying to get to; this can't happen, but reached only, 'No', before he ran. He wheeled away and the water of the puddles cartheeled behind his trotters. He ran and, in running, his heart swelled and yammered until the organ felt not only bigger than his chest, but bigger than he deserved. He was a coward. On a rise, folded up from the forest floor, in between drifts of fallen Laburnum pods, Piglet fell. He crawled into the roots of an old tree. Piglet", "label": 1}
{"text": "did not know what to do, in which way to express his shock. He tried to maturbate with his right arm, to smoke with his left, but the cigarette wouldn't light and what little hard-on he could muster quickly went out. He opened his eyes, looking back to where the Christian's hut sat silent in the quiet of the Latter Wood. The animals and insects were too busy staring at him ' judgementally- to chirrup or cicada or even talk. Piglet closed his eyes. It seemed his only option. Shivering and weeping and changing the mud and rainwater and rotting vegetation not at all, the small pig rose into sleep, unconsciousness taking him up in mawkish, felt, black wings not unlike the colour of depression. Not long into the sensation of rising, Piglet dreampt a dream. It was of a little girl. Not very pretty, she looked as though she may have a slow mind. She had skin the colour of the mud he was lying in, and lips smeared with yellow, as though she had been chewing on the tree above Piglet. She was asleep. He wasn't alone. In the Latter Wood, not a leaf flapped, not a gust blew, not a squirrel scrabbled, not a worm turned. There are studies that show monkeys developing tool use, simultaneously on different islands, as though connected by an underlying consciouness. For a few moments, the Latter Wood breathed as if one body, and the breaths lengthened, and softened, and it began to snore. At just that moment, Mr Him woke. His arm rifled pain into his shoulder. He growled and rolled onto his side. His neck muscles clenched and sank nails of agony into is spine. 'Argggh, fuck,' said Mr Him, and rose to his knees. He didn't know how long he had been knocked out, by the blast, but his tongue was a landed fish that had swollen with rot. The disabled toilet, gaping before him, was thoroughly broken and Mr Him's body knew how it felt. He staggered to his feet and through its entrance. The back of the toilet had been exploded open, revealing a cave beyond and, at the edge of his sight, the gloaming of the cave's opening. Cussing, wiping a jacket arm that was whiter (with dust) than the cream it had been, Mr Him stumbled into the toilet and, from there, into the cave. If it hadn't been for the sound his swearing she wouldn't have woken. Even in the sleep of unconsciousness, the teacher in her kicked in, like a baby in the womb. 'How dare you,' Mrs Her croaked. 'Stand up, right now.' Her tongue cracked across its skin and felt as though it had been snapped in two. She shifted and half a toilet door slid from her prostrate form. Her hair, a tangle at the most combed of times, was now a cloth that had been used as a duster. Her beard had at least an additional days growth to it. Flattening her hand to the floor, and feeling loose pins and screws prick it, she pushed herself up. Unable to stop herself, Mrs Her coughed, hacked and spat on the floor, and stared at the gruel, then at her front. She found herself quite disagreeable. After this, she turned her head to stare between her fringe and the blasted jambs. There, in the distance, she saw the jacketed back of a man she found even less agreeable. She spat again, and followed Mr Him. Aimee was asleep. She was in the dark, and shadows made a deeper pitch in shards at the edge of her vision. She wasn't herself. Whoever and wherever she was, she was moving. Gradually, a faded, duskish mouth of grey appeared. There was a shadow shifting across it, and weaving, like a hairy tongue. Aimee realised she was following another person. The silhoutte stopped at the entrance to the cave and snuffled and ran its right arm across its nose. There was the sound of a slight slickage of mucus being wiped across satin. Mr Him, she thought, slow as treacle might think, if it were dreaming. The field of vision was still moving, though it wasn't a field but, rather, a cave. In the nooks and niches and darkest places of the cavern, arachnids could be heard, the hairy crackle, here and there, of a giant spider leaning forward, the chord of thick saliva drawn fang to fang. Aimee tried to ignore this and managed to do so, possibly because she wasn't her, and was, in the dreaming, somebody else entirely. She was taller, of that Aimee could be sure. And she had a beard. Mrs Her, she thought. Mr Him left the cavern, hunched as though against the sudden onset of wind. In the dream, Aimee followed. By the jagged lines of her strides, Mrs Her was very angry indeed. As she rose into the Latter Wood at the end of the cave, her vision blurred and Aimee woke up. On a table. Linen spread down from her chin. The smell of herself filled the hut. She had the aching, pressed cheek of being in the same position for a long time. The cramped fingers. The dessicated throat. The dried lines of mucus around her eyes, from where she had been crying in her sleep. The chapped, flaked nose, the caked lips. It was then she realised she was no longer asleep, no longer wearing her lilac dress, no longer pale-skined. 'Where am I?' she said. She lay on a table in the Christian's hut. In the silver plates he had offered to someone's ancestors, she saw herself. She didn't look like Aimee, anymore. She looked like Amy. In his dream a dark haired woman sat on the bed, pinning one of Piglet hands. Yes, he thought, hands. She had the look of the Witch, but skinnier. The beautiful woman methodically drew his pinned arm from the linen, as though drawing a tape-worm.", "label": 1}
{"text": "'Look,' the woman said, to somebody Piglet could not see. 'Look at the fingers. Yellow. Fucking yellow. She's been eating that poisonous tree. That's why she won't wake up.' From the side of the bed came a shifting sound of awkwardness, but silence from the mouth of the man who stood there. Piglet could tell it was a man, without looking. The woman gave him such a look of contempt. 'Cat got your tongue? Aye, useless bastard. That's the best thing you've said today.' 'Whatever.' The woman's eyes narrowed, concentrating their scorn, which seemed too much for the slits to hold, and escaped into a curling of her lips. This, thought Piglet, could be the Witch's twin. The woman's eyes wavered. 'Aye, and on her teeth. Look. Fucking look.' The plumage of the dream was fading, feather by feather, into the hues of the forest, and Piglet woke. A girl was walking toward him, up the folded curve of mud. At first, wiping his trotters across his eyes, Piglet thought it Aimee, but, in the next second, knew it was as different from her as the woman in the dream to the Witch. Which was to say - not much at all. The girl wore Aimee's dress but it was stained. It was green not lilac, now, and appeared to be cut from corduroy. Her stride, also, was not sprightly but now haphazard as a ghost that had forgotten, thanks to the intervening death, how its limbs were supposed to work. Aimee's skin tone, once pale as a princess in a fairy tale, was now beige, and had a touch of the gypsy. Morever, thought Piglet, mind as bleary as his eyes, Aimee was pretty. 'Piglet,' said the girl. At least she knows me, thought the little pig. 'She took bear. The Witch.' This didn't seem to be a question, and Piglet decided to stare at it and the girl until they both went away. 'We're going to get him back. Him and my baby. You don't need to worry, Piglet. The Witch won't hurt us. She can't. This world isn't real. And I'm not Aimee.' Piglet tried to voice a sentence but it stuck in his mouth. He hacked and spat a thin line of saliva into a handy puddle. 'Who are you?' he said. 'Amy,' the girl said. Piglet frowned but the girl walked past him, paying no attention to his facial expression she rose to the crest of the hillock. Piglet's elbows and shoulders creaked as he went to join her. He felt old. 'What do you mean, this world isn't real? Am I still dreaming?' The girl turned to stare at him. 'You knew?' she said. Piglet blinked. He opened his mouth but the girl put the twig of a tanned finger to her lips and pointed down into the dale below them. At its far side, a human scrambled up the bluff, sending out small exclamations of dirt and cussing insects. He stopped, snuffled, wiped his nose with the satined arm of his nicotine-hued jacket and, braced as though a gale were building continued to the peak of the next rise, before disappearing over it. Strangely, it wasn't windy in the least. 'Strange,' said Piglet. 'I was just dreaming about him' and him.' A giant of a red-bearded man followed, crouching and hustling from tree to tree, from bush to bush. 'That's a her,' said Amy. 'Mrs Her. Nothing is what it looks like it appears to be, and fewer things are what they seem,' she added in a whisper. With that, she followed them. Shrugging what little he had in the way of shoulders, Piglet followed the girl. Chapter 2 IN WHICH AMY RISES FROM HER BED, AND FALLS FROM THE GROUND They walked North and the Latter Wood, as woods do in this hemisphere, grew colder. Between the trees, when the land rose, could be seen the hills at the Northern rim of the world. The horizon. The hills were as big as mountains, but rolling, and under them, like a snowglass turned on its head, could be seen the Underhill. And in its darkness, hanging upside-down from the concave curve, was the Dark Tower Block where the Witch lived. Amy preferred it when the land was lower, or the trees tighter, or hanging with the yellow confetti of their pods, because the sight of the Witch's home, hanging, illogically as it did, from the inside of a hill, made her mind ache. They did not creep but they made no noise. There was no noise in this part of the forest to make. It was as frozen as a realm could be; from top to bottom. The trees were encrusted in so much rime every bough looked identical. The pods that hung in chadeliers could not so much as twinkle, so fixed with frost were they. Besides which, a piglet and a young girl - when they travel - travel quiet without trying. The fully grown teacher before them, shuffling along the path, made more sound than they did. So did Mrs Her, but Mr Him didn't notice. He seemed intent on the horizon, his feet in a hurry to get past each other, and he stumbled as he came close to a run. The path of the forest they followed bent and curved into a dale so that the Underhill was no longer visible, and they ' Mr Him, Mrs Her, Piglet and Amy ' tripped over small streams that had become popsicles of green, trip-trapped over wooden bridges and, eventually, walked along a road that seemed, in the twilight light, so sallow it was almost yellow. The light level, in the North of the Latter Wood, was always doing night. The road had sprung up in the northern eaves of the Latter Wood like, Amy could imagine Uncle Chris saying, a line of piss, and led to what seemed, from glances throught the flora, to be snow-laden rooves. Even below", "label": 1}
{"text": "the white and in the dusk, the tiles of the rooves were visible, like buried bodies; red and vibrant as blood and, as they came into view, the houses beneath them were built of mortar and brick as putrid as the colour of the road under their feet. 'The chocolate box village,' said Piglet, to himself, but a little too loud, so that it reached Amy. 'I know,' she said. 'I copied it from a box of cholcolates.' It wasn't only chocolate. The rooves, closer up, were sculpted of jelly and oscillated in a wind Amy could not feel. The walls were made of marcepan. The well at the village's centre was fudge cake. The trees that decorated it were Black Forest Gateau. From the well led a length of chain at the end of which was something that was not, by all measures, confectionary. A lump of pelted flesh, fur that scarcely covered its skin, and skin that didn't cover the wounds that had been dug in it. 'Bear,' said Amy, but Piglet grasped her hand. They held each other, fingers to trotter. There was a click and a catch of flame on wick and Mr Him hurried out into the village, bearing a lamp that swung as though excited. The way the lead lines of its box oscillated, it reminded Amy of a face that was licking its lips. In his other hand, Mr Him held a bell. He didn't so much smile ' the light from the lantern careening across his whiskers and his taut, grey mouth ' as grimace with expectation, as he rang it. As one, the houses in the village sang, 'Ding! Dong!' The male teacher laughed - short, guttural breathes floating away in clouds of grey. He rang again. 'Ding! Dong!' the houses in the village repeated and, like from a score of birthday cakes, children burst from their doors. They were singing. 'Ding, dong!' Then the other side of the village. 'Ding, dong!' Then, as one, 'Wake up your stupid head, Ding, dong, The bear is dead. Wake up your stupid head, The bastard bear is dead.' The bear, though, was not; not yet. Barnaby tried to rise, bloodied at the umbilical end of the chain, then collapsed back to earth. There was the splatter of loose fur falling with him. Mr Him rang the bell and the children danced. Even from the distance of the bluff behind which she and Piglet hid, Amy could tell their eyes were blank as glazing in the village windows, smiles as contorted as the melted treacle down the side of the door jambs. In one of the many books she had read, she remembered a breed of dogs called a Pavlov, who salivated when a bell was rung. Dogs that did whatever a scientist wanted them to do. These were Mr Him's dogs. 'Ding, dong, Wake up your stupid head, Ding dong, The bear is dead.' Piglet said, 'They're baiting him.' Amy didn't need to be told. The children were kicking and punching the broken-furred bear and then withdrawing as Barnaby slashed out with his claws. The bear was rapidly tiring. At their provocation, something other than his skin apperared to be tearing. Mr Him was giggling. Reddening, Amy rose with her blood. She couldn't see her bear suffer. Piglet dragged at her arm and she turned to throw him away from her. 'Look,' he said, pointing a trotter. Amy was not alone. Mrs Her had also risen, and was striding out across the first few tiffin cobbles of the village square. Her footsteps didn't appear to be stalking anymore. For some reason, Amy remembered Mr Him saying, 'The things you feel will one day lift houses off the ground. Whole houses clean off the ground.' 'Ding!' The bell faltered in Mr Him's hand. It clanked. 'Dang!' There was a crack, like the creak of a house in deep midwinter when frost works into the rendering, but deeper, more integral. Jelly took to the air, then marzipan, then chocolate, then the tiffin cobbles. One of the houses rose. Mrs Her fell to her right knee, cracking a perfectly good tiffin. Mr Him didn't so much speak as squeak and flung himself to the side, away from the bell. The airborn house spun, once, as though caught in a hurricane, and then shattered against the village square. The chocolate mortar was more substantial than it looked. Three children, who had been staring up at it, disappeared beneath its impact. 'What did you do to them?' Mrs Her could be heard shouting. 'You were their teacher.' Without the bell, the children did not dance. Mr Him did, dodging away as Mrs Her brought another house to the sky. Blood fell in lines from her bottom lip. She tried to shout and could not. From her books on anatomy, Amy thought, collapsed lung, and then stopped thinking and ran. She bore down the slope, with Piglet at her heels. She could hear his trotters. As she neared, there was a crack that wasn't made by shortbread crumbling, but came from the area of Mrs Her's spine. She collapsed as all the remaining houses were torn from their foundations of cake mix. A hurricane would have been proud. Amy crouched at Barnaby's side, pulling and tugging and hefting at the iron collar at his throat. 'No,' she said, desperately. She looked at the sky. Mr Him was doing the same. There was a score of houses flung high, but not for long. The village outskirts were too far away. Mr Him's eyes fell to the well. He lopped toward it, his satin jacket glistening as he dropped his lantern. The flames wafted and guttered as they burst on then burnt into the cobbles, charring the tiffins. A house smashed down two feet behind Amy's knees. Her and the Bear were covered in a thin filament of sugared dust. Mr Him jumped, looking for his all his whiskers and pale", "label": 1}
{"text": "skin like a rabbit about to enter its hole, and escape the fox. The moment ended abruptly when Piglet hit him from the side. 'Bear,' said Amy in a shout, 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry it took me so long to come. I was scraed. He looked up at her, his eyes darker than before with pain and shock and the abnegation of what had been done to him by children. She couldn't keep his eyes in her gaze and looked away. 'Quick,' she said. 'Into the well.' The children stood still, like little soldiers; falling one after another under the houses. Finally, Barnaby's snout moved. It may have been a nod, and it was enough. They jumped at the well, and, as the darkness of falling masonary impactetd about them, they entered the thin circle of its darkness. Piglet hung onto Mr Him's shirt tails. There was a rip but not long enough to sever the material. 'You- you-you,' Mr Him could be heard to say. He could not move. The Piglet was incredibly strong. 'Little Pig?' Piglet offered, though he knew he should never complete a stammerer's senetence. Looking up, Piglet said, 'Oh, you cun'' but the collapsing house ended his word, his sentence, him, and Mr Him all at once. The bricks of the well hared by and passed into the light above Amy. The light dwindled, and all the quicker because she couldn't help but look down. They fell improbably fast. Not at an impossible speed, of course, but only if you were a light ray. Everything was a blur, and that included her and the bear. They stretched out, spaghetti-ing, even their eyes. Amy was sure she could, at one point, see her irises. They plummeted straight down, then straight sideways, and then vertically once more, though Amy couldn't tell if this was down again. The well seemed to have no end until, abruptly, Barnaby came to a halt and Aimee slammed into his back. He shifted in a jolt. 'Wha..?' said Amy. 'I'm stuck,' growled the bear. Impercibly, like a trick of the light, the well shaft had narrowed and Barnaby was wedged within it. Amy twisted her head round and craned her neck. The grey gloaming far above appeared to wink. 'We'll climb back up,' said Amy. She didn't like the feel of where this hole was leading. There was a nasty smell rising from below her and it wasn't the bear, or not the bear alone. 'Okay,' said Barnaby, stretching his paw up toward a protruding brick. In a naueas, grinding moment the teeth in the gears of time seemed to stick then roll forward as the Bear resumed his downward slide. Screaming, Amy followed him, the chain between them stretching out until it became taut. Her screams ceased only as they hit water which enveloped both bear and little girl. She sputtered and gagged and spat into the mirk. The liquid tasted of urine and faeces and the rot that would congeal between both, if they were left together alone, and for long enough. The smell would have been appalling if there was room in the girl's mind to be appalled. As it was, she was drowning and the screaming had restarted, if only inside her mind. In the dark, she got turned around and couldn't locate which way was down and, more importantly, which way was up. She bumped against Barnaby and couldn't get by him. She felt sure he was blocking the passage to air. Her lungs shivered in the convulsions of the dying. The fits were spreading. Her chest, her arms, her hands. She clawed at the bear's back, forgetting that he was her friend. Searching, searching for what she had taken for granted. Air. Her lungs pancaked and burnt and separted into long grasping fingers. It was all she could do to keep her mouth closed. He throat paniced and tried to get through her lips. She broke the surface. She gasped and took in oxygen. The well was lighter than she had remembered and pained her eyes. Below her, the miasma of water was greyed by the imprint of the light source above. The sun. It shouldn't be- not above her, and not lit. It was the dusk and with the directions she had gone, in the well, that way couldn't be up. In her experience, everything was nonsense. She shook her head. In the liquid, she could see the bear desperately stretching. He was still stuck. In the water, as in a lens, his form was fattened. His black eyes bulged until they were wide as the eyes of a shark. The chain was still in her palm and she tightened her fingers and, pinioning her slight frame between the well's wet walls, pulled. Barnaby didn't move. Gritting her teeth on her bottom lip until it bled, she did this again and Barnaby's snout came through the liquid. He snuffed and sniffed. With another effort, she brought forth his head. The bear, though, would budge no further. 'I'm stuck again,' he said, unnecessarily. 'Yes, you are,' said Amy. She was breathing hard and dripping. 'I'm wet,' she added. Then, 'It smells like pee and poo in here.' After a moment, Barnaby said, 'We are in a toilet.' Amy stared at him then, shifting, she gazed up the well. Above her was the sun. It was hard and unblinking. Inbetween her and it, there was a bulge of white china, and the impression of a rim of black plastic. 'We are in a toilet,' said Amy. 'Climb up and flush it,' said Barnaby. 'I'll be able to get free. The wee is slippy.' Amy nodded. With an effort of cold and wet limbs, and gagging, puling lungs, she crabbed, feet on one wall, back on the other, up the shaft. Two lines of bricks up, and one slipping downward, she eventually made the shining white bowl. The toilet, thankfully, had no u-bend. She drew herself from the", "label": 1}
{"text": "toilet and out onto an encrusted, hard desert floor. Her mind swam and spun. For a moment, she felt as disorientated as she had been, below, in the latrine, before she realised that the toilet faced sideways, not up, and that where the sky should have been, there was a jagged landscape of broken mountains and spikes of leaf-shorn pines. The ground that she lay upon was concave and, she realised slowly, the ceiling of a giant cave. With a mental spasm, she said, 'I'm in the Underhill'. The sun she had seen was visible in the arch of sky between the hill's ceiling and floor. It was setting, though by this, Amy thought she meant it was reddening, as it didn't really have anywhere to set, and could onto stay framed in a bell curve of space, going gradually black. It was not alone. Also as dark as black could be, and still some way off, stood the Witch's home. The Dark Tower Block. As the sun went crimson from its setting, the tower block's electric-sallow lights were going on, one by one. Amy turned and puked on the cave's ceiling. Part of what forced it up was the smell on her skin, on her browned corduroy dreess. Part was the disorientation of the landscape. Mostly, what came up was pale water, with a little bile. 'Amy!' the toilet shouted. 'Bear,' said the girl, through beige lips, remembering. She crawled across to the sideways toilet, and yanked at its chain. The bear stood beside her, dribbling onto the brown lily pads of the caked desert floor. He sounded like the end of a shower, or the sputter of her mother peeing into the toilet next to a bath Amy was taking. Behind them, the latrine was broken, ruptured by the bear's passing out of it. 'This is the Witch's kingdom. The dolls must have brought the children here through that toilet and the well. It's good night is coming,' Bear said. 'It will be harder for the Witch's winged monkeys to see us.' 'For God's Sake. They aren't monkeys, they're bloody gorillas,' said Amy, surprising herself by how like her mother she sounded. It must be swallowing all that shit, thought Amy. Barnaby turned to look at the girl. Once, she would have been scared of him eating her. Now, she thought she was too bitter to swallow, and not just because of the faeces that coated her skin. At some point, she had forgotten how to care about anything but her baby. 'We're going there, you know,' said Barnaby. His voice was low and small, eroded as the dunes around them. Amy nodded and started to walk toward the Dark Tower Block. She could hear him following. Night turned to day and day turned to night and back again as though all the sun had to do was change its clothes. The cold then the sun beat down upon Amy and the bear and the space between the toilet and the tower block seemed to take on a dimension that was not entirely that of distance. Sweat washed Amy's forehead, and mingled with the odours in her armpits. There were times when she didn't know where she was and others when she wished she didn't. They hurried from sand ridge to sand dune, to compacted bluffs of hard, brown earth. From time to time, the cries of gorillas filled the Underhill, sounding for all this world like children tortured until they were mad. Then, Amy and the bear would crawl, or stop; cowering smudges of brown in a beige landscape. The gorrilas could not circle, though. The ones they saw flew lopsidedly, with tattered or thoroughly torn wings, and could barely manage an oval of flight before screaming, and retreating. They didn't seem able to face the bear again. At other times, dehydrated and exhausted, Amy thought she would fall, then looked up and, seeing the spined, jagged ceiling, wondered which way falling would be. This brought her round, and quickly. She stumbled, often at the end of the chain that was still attached to the bear as though a dog on his leash. She stumbled as though in a daze and' ' Amy opened her eyes. Her eyelids cleared, stretching several days of gunge between them. The blues and whites in her sight coalesced and she realised she was looking at her ceiling and walls in her bedroom at 4 Appleby Close. 'No,' she said, and squeezed her eyes shut and fell asleep again' ' 'I'm waking up,' she said to the Bear. Her lips were frazzled. She tried to scream and managed a whisper, 'I'm waking up.' Barnaby was holding her. 'Don't hold me, don't hold my hand.' 'You have to go now, but you'll come back to where I am. I'll make it for you. I'll reach the tower. I'll carry you.' Amy's voice cracked as though her throat had given up. 'LET GO OF MY HAND.'' ' Her feet scattered left and right as she went down the stairs. She reached the door and turned its handle, entering the porch. She reached its door and turned the handle. She was dressed only in the skin of her pyjamas and was bare footed. She walked out onto the path, then the pavement, then the road. No-one, it seemed, heard her go. 'No,' she said, to no-one inparticular. Perhaps to this world. 'Can't wake up.' She was walking the other way from her Day School, through a tight green-fenced walkway and across another road. A car's beep turned into a beeeeeeeeep and she didn't hear it. Her hand closed around the paw of teddy bear that was not there. She walked across grass. The thin green leaves of it plucked at the spaces between her toes and wiped moisture across her soles. The grass went away as she walked onto the squidgy black tarmacing of a children's play-area. As she approached the slide, she collapsed' '", "label": 1}
{"text": "with her make-up. 'Yes, Mam,' Amy said. She didn't move as her mother reached down. 'Let's see, love.' Her Mam's fingers burrowed into her pockets. Amy's mind went walkabout. Once, on a field trip, she had seen a dead rabbit by the road. Beyond a pastry of flies, the end of a worm had winked, pink-wet, from its ripped flesh. If the rabbit had been able to feel, the worm would have felt like Amy's Mam's fingers did now. Amy's mother pulled out a wrinkled line of white tissue, nettled with green. 'Why do you lie to me?' she asked. The words sounded hurt but not to Amy, who had blanked out the sound of the sentence, and couldn't respond. She knew what was coming. Not words, but actions, and all the clearer for it. Her mother's hand whipped up and to the right, drawn to the corner of the porch. It stayed, perhaps sensing that this was a School Day. The nails were red, but were tinged with pink, as the rabbit's bowels had been. In the light from the faux stained-glass-window, her mother's palm appeared to be green. She stared at Amy with icy, chipped-out eyes. They didn't seem interested in undressing her. Jerk by jerk, the hand climbed back down, like a gheko. 'And have you got tissues, pet?' her Mam said, turning to Aidan. Amy twisted down and round, her hand whisking into Aidan's pocket. She took out the tissue Amy had given him, earlier, in the bathroom, made of toilet paper. It was a folded square; a tiny flag. Amy waved it, not in surrender, but in a stand above the boy's head. 'Fine, let's go.' Her Mam held out a hand to the little boy. Amy took it. They had walked some way from Appleby Close, through the B roads, and were into the C roads, closing in on the school. C did not stand for Close, nor for having an ocean view, but was so named because the blocks across from the North Road were ordered alphabetically. This helped, being by the school, the children to learn their ABC's, though their education finished at F. The roads after F were private, and could afford their own Capital Letters. The houses they passed were, like Amy's, dark grey; the candour of corpses that had dug themselves out of the grave. The inhabitants were a paler shade. Their front windows were lidded and suspicious. In the late summer afternoons, the occasional barbecue would be struck up, and celebrated long into the night. The occasion would be apropos of nothing more than there being sunshine and, of course, Stella. Children emerged from alleys like small, silent ghosts, passing the green electricity boxes on which they would usually sit and swear and spit. The pavements were land-mined by chewing gum. Apart from the odd gobbing, the sporadic catcall, the children were now too sleepy to be anything other than social. After a day of school they would up the ante. It wasn't uncommon for twelve-year-olds to joyride these streets. Behind the houses were garages. There were holes in the garage walls. In the holes; plastic bags. In the bags; marihuana. Amy had seen teenagers take out Wilkinson carriers, their hoods up, shoulders closed in. She saw them from her bedroom window, along with that time a flat was arsoned. She had watched it burn, flames licking around the edges of its brick wall, smoke hungrily lapping around the edges of the blaze. She didn't know who called the fire brigade. The Day School gates emerged from the C roads and they, Amy and Aidan and Mam, walked toward their green metal, across a broken concrete patch. The weeds had been ground down underfoot. Mam's walk was brisk as ever, demanding adult motions from Amy's legs. The girl stumbled, eyeing the faded white and yellow lines of the common land. Mam stopped, abruptly. She didn't like to wait before the gates but had little choice, as a family pushed in before them. Amy had seen the family's mother in a front garden, in the F roads, all slapped-pink flesh, short hair and a waist that went on forever. Fishwife, her Mam had called her. She looked more like a Whalewife, thought Amy, not altogether maliciously. She liked whales. 'Get a move on, pet,' her Mam said, twisting Amy's fingers. Forced to move, the girl was buffeted by another family. 'Say excuse me!' her Mam said to Amy, smiling at the adult. 'Bairns, eh?' She laughed, but the smile didn't reach the top half of her face. Her eyes killed it as it crossed her cheeks. 'Bye, then, pet,' said her Mam, in the Day School voice, when they were through. She bent and kissed Amy's cheek. Amy felt herself receding, as she did when Barney squeezed her hand, but there was no world to slip into, and she returned as her Mam petted Aidan, her hands on his small, shaven head, on his bare elbows. Amy knew the raggedly bitten tips of those fingers and the little girl's toes rubbed against each other, itching to run into the school reception. She was rooted, though, as much as the Laburnum tree at the bottom of their garden. She couldn't break free. To move would have taken a Herculean Feat, as her Night School teachers would say. Amy had seen a picture of Hercules and she didn't have one foot that was as strong as his, let alone two. Not in this world. Not without red shoes. Her Mam let go of Aidan and Amy finally walked into the Day School. She didn't take the boy's hand, but he followed, as though there was something between them, something invisible, something secret. A black bin bag had been through Amy's room and taken the one thing she cared about. The Care Bears, also, were gone, as were several books and three coloured-in drawings. Barney was a hole in the duvet that", "label": 1}
{"text": "She looked sideways, which was the natural way for her to look, given that she was lying on her side. Hardbaked sand nibbled at her cheeks. The sun was a basketball of orange repeatedly bounced into her eyes. 'Leave, girl, you cannot walk. You can hear me. Leave. Wake up in your world. I'm not at the tower yet. Wake up!' She did' ' She was in male arms. The groove of poorly formed biceps was unmistakable. Sometimes on the way home from her Mam's pub Uncle Chris would carry her from the car. Then, the sound was the same. Feet heavier than they were used to being, on gravel. This time, though, there was no turning of a key in the door, but a pressing on a doorbell that did not work, followed by a knocking. The door opened. 'Amy,' said her Mam. 'I found her in the park.' Her Mam grabbed her from the stranger's arms. The man continued, 'She'd collapsed. Right by the slide, love.' 'What the Hell were you doing there? Stupid bairn!' said her Mam. Shock made her sound younger than she was. The same age as the woman in the sepia photograph when Amy was wearing her Christening dress. 'Is she alright?' said the stranger-man. His voice was an unrecognisable blur not unlike his face. 'She looks ill. Her lips are yellow.' 'Aye,' her mother sounded older. The words were shorter. Bent out of shape. 'She's fine.' 'Does she need to see a doctor, love?' 'Mind yer own,' said her Mam. Amy could have told him to stop there. To stand very still. To avoid eye contact. To nod when necessary, but not too much. Amy could have been full of useful advice. The man, however, said, 'Look, do you want me to call a doctor? The bairn looks really ill.' Her Mam; 'What's it to you,. eh? What were you doing hanging around the park, anyways? Looking at little girls? What are you, a paedo?' 'Okay, love, okay...' 'Don't you fucking 'love' me. You fucking paedo.' He was backing away. Amy could almost hear him glancing at the other houses in the street. 'Okay, okay,' he said, though the tone in his words said it wasn't. Her Mam slammed the door and threw Amy against the stairs. Through the fog of her body, pain reverbated, like the echo of a yell. Her Mam was standing over her, slapping her. Something was digging into her cheek. It may have been a step. It may have been her Mam's nails. She was swearing but the world was whining like a bomb about to go off. Her Mam was dragging her up the stairs. Amy thought of Winnie the Poo, at least until the jolting of her head against the steps made her lose consciousness. She came round infront of the Dark Tower Block. It was dusk. They arrived, in a shortish time, at a door with a gate in it, and an intercom on that. Barnaby pressed the button labelled 'in'in Orange and taped on with sellotape that had long since gone beige in the middle, and brown at its tattered edges. The gate and the door and the intercom were all graffiteed with synonyms for 'whore', and one line that read; 'Needless to say I hate you'. There was a scrawl, on the door, which said, 'If there are any problems with vandals please call 078837384992 and she'll give you good head, the dirty bitch'. 'Yes'' said a voice from the intercom. It was shot through with static, or with bile, Amy couldn't tell. 'I need to come in,' said Barnaby. 'No.' 'I have a little girl with me.' Barnaby raised his chain to the door's window and, by extension, Amy. A pause, in the background of which Amy thought she heard screaming. It couldn't possibly be, of course; it went on for far too long. Above the door, the Dark Tower Block loomed and beyond it the sun, under the hill. The sunset had almost set. The sky was turning necrotic and bits of it had the look of wanting to fall off. 'Yes,' said the intercom. The door opened. Within its foyer, the Dark Tower Block was, incongruously, well lit. Under the bare electric lights that went up the stairwell, the floortiles of the Dark Tower Block were not black and white but black and blue, and shiny as shiners. There was blood in puddles around the blues, and the blacks seemed slightly swollen. The lights fizzled, but did so slow. Amy followed Barnaby. Her skin shivered in lumps, and tried to migrate around to her back. All of the doors to the flats on the ground floor were open. There were too many of them for the floorplan and each held the sound of fingers on keyboards, incessant as rabbits on their greens. Once, she saw a figure hunched over a screen. He was malnourished, more wraith than human, and whatever he watched was doing the screaming she had heard earlier. Somehow, the sound had not yet stopped. Three bottles of unlabelled pop stood opened by its chair. The pop was a dark, rusted yellow. Amy thought she saw children in the computer screens. There was a click and the monitors switched off. The inhabitants of the flats began to scream in chorus. The one she could see turned. His eyes were big and square and vacant as the screen haloing them. His cheeks were bones, his fingers seemed to hang from his knuckles. He was naked. The door, modestly, swung shut, clipping his scream as if a belt around the ear. All the other doors did the same. 'This doesn't look good,' said the Bear. He looked at Amy. There was a patch of dessication in the wetness of his gaze. Whatever was the opposite of a glint, she thought. The lights fizzled out and all the squares went black. Then all white, as the electricity came back on. 'Oh,'", "label": 1}
{"text": "said Barnaby. 'Hello little girl, have you got a smile for your Granny?' There was a grinding creak as the Russian Doll bent down, as though ligaments knashed within her knees. 'Oh, you smell nice, little fart. I bet you'd be good for the eating.' There was a moan, despairing and low. It didn't, though, come from Amy's oesaphagus, but from the bear's. 'Oh, dear, the bear knows he can't save you.' The Doll wasn't looking at Barnaby, but at Amy. Her puffy flesh moved and shifted and wrinkled like a pie made from game that were still up for a fight. 'The last time we met in a knock down scrap, I knocked him out. The Witch told me to knock him out, you know. Then, you know what she said, she said eat him. Teddy bears taste yummy, she told me. But I prefer little girls. They are lip-smackingly good.' The Doll illustrated her words. A slight line of spittle landed on Amy's chest. The gunge was thick and lime green and reminded her of a Witch's finger. She couldn't move, to wipe it off, and it lay there, cold as her Mam's skin at night. 'Really,' said the bear. 'How do you know what bear flesh tastes like? It might taste better.' Barnaby held up his right arm, its pelt blistered by the sun. He put one of his claws in a wound. He ripped it open and staggered, his face mesmerised by the pain, to the edge of the foyer. A blue, electric light hissed and fizzled next to his head. By Amy's cheek, the bent Doll made the same sound. It seemed to smell things the girl could not. Bear-blood wet the floor tiles, coloured pink on the blacks, and crimson on the whites. It sprayed as Barnaby punched the light's housing. In a cackle of cracking glass, like the Witch's laughter, the light fell in smithereens. The wiring hissed and sparked by the bear's ear. 'What is it doing?' said the Doll. In it's abdomen, Amy could hear the question repeated. The dolls inside were becoming curious. There was a ripping sound as one of them put its nose through the Granny's solar plexus. Barnaby put his bleeding, pussing right arm into the electric wiring, and his bulk jerked. He was lifted onto the claws of his feet. There was a scorched aroma of charcoaling bear flesh, misting into the foyer. Amy could hear Barnaby's fangs clenching, chattering. He couldn't let go. The Doll licked its teeth, and more molars appeared through its cheek, nibbling in an ectasy of hunger at its flesh. Saliva dribbled around the edges of the Doll's chin. 'Oh, that smells so good. So very good.' It smelt to Amy like gamon frying. The Granny brushed past her. Amy retched but could not open her mouth. (A head that had emerged from its torso snapped, trying to taste her, but missed.) The Doll had reached the bear and sunk several of its sets of teeth in. Half a doll had emerged from its belly, and did the same to Barnaby's thigh. As contact was made the Doll jerked and writhed against Barnaby's pelt. That didn't stop a ripping sound as more of the teeth joining in. Amy ran to the stairs. Amy fell. Her skin barked on the lip of a step. The concrete felt like a long tooth. Blood seeped onto the step, across it, then up the next, and along that. Abruptly, the cut began to drip upward, falling up the stair's shaft and disappearing intio darkness beyond the electric lights. Amy's eyes followed it, her head tilting upward. With her teeth, she ripped off a line of her cordoroy sleeves. She spat it out before her, across the beginnings of the stairs. Soft as feather, it began to float upward, with the blood. She stretched out her hand and it twisted the same way, as though gravity had been reversed. Her mind hurt more than her shin. Somewhere up above she heard a child's cry. 'Aidan,' she said. She couldn't step onto the stairs. 'Shut it, you little brat,' the Witch shouted, above her in the darkness. There was the slamming of a door, and Aidan shut up. Amy ran around the base of the stairs. She stared at the space under the steps. With a stretch of legs like a gymnast, she strode out onto the underneath of the stairs. She stood there, bent, foetal so she could fit. Above her, now were the black and white tiles. Upside down, she ascended, walking round and round the central shaft, on the underneath of the steps. Amy, standing on the ceiling of the landing, had to jump to reach the button of the lift. It lit as she hit it but, instead of the rumble of the gear mechanism and shafts spinning into action, there was only a sound of laughter that rumbled. The sound surrounded her, behind the wall not only of the lift doors, but also that of the central shaft of the stairwell, as though Amy stood in the lung of a ho-ho-hoing giant. Her chest ached, though that may not have been her exhaustion, but the sound of the bear being electrocuted below her' or above, she thought. 'Well,' she said. 'I guess I'll have to climb.' It hurt to talk ' her lips were cracked from her passage across the Underhill - so she stopped. Instead, she clamboured onto the top of the window and, using its bars, shimmied up to the lip of what would have been its ledge, if this world were not upside- down. She did not look out of the window, let alone down, her mind felt vertiginous from all that had happened to her. She couldn't risk seeing the fall. Amy then leapt, catching the first black, cane-like railing of the next flight of stairs, hoisting herself to stand under its step, and restarted her climb, on", "label": 1}
{"text": "the underside of the concrete staircase. The eyehole in the door was more an eye than a hole. It winked at Amy, then closed. It was rimmed by eyelashes. 'Knock, knock,' said the door. Amy stared at it. 'You say 'Who's there?',' said the door. 'What?' said Amy. 'You say 'Who's there?',' said the door, sounding peevish. 'Who's there?' said Amy. 'A door,' said the door. 'A door who?' said Amy, catching on with all the quickness of a child. 'Adore the witch,' said the door, 'or she'll fucking kill you.' The door opened. Inside the penthouse suite lay the lounge of 4 Appleby Close. The dimensions though, had warped. The T.V set was bigger than the sofa. The fireplace was smaller than one of the postcards on its mantle. Everything was upside down and stuck to the ceiling. Looking made Amy's mind swell. 'Come in, pet,' said a voice from above. Amy nodded to herself. The action of it felt older than her skull. She entered. The carpet at her feet was soft as ever. It didn't take a downward to glance to know this was due to the floral print having grown out with mould, mound and swirls of it like a green brain. She looked up. Between the artex fins of the ceiling stood the Witch. She was breastfeeding Aiden, despite his age. Her breast was blue, and her nipple, large and flaccid, looked as though it had been pressed to something cold. Aiden coughed, and she forced him back on, his legs struggling against her hips. 'What are you looking at, you little pervert?' the Witch said. 'Give him to me,' said Amy. 'He's my baby, not yours.' The Witch laughed hard as the artexing. 'You're a little confused, aren't you, mite? He's mine, not yours. You're not old enough to have children.' The Witch took to the air. Her tight black dress exposing curves that turned to bulges, lifting at the hem. 'You did bad things to him,' said Amy. 'You're not his Mam anymore. You're not my Mam anymore.' 'It's my baby, and I'll do with it as I please. Just like I did with you, pet. You're mine.' Her upper lip curled. The Witch turned, becoming her way up. She held Aiden up and out. His arm hung oddly, as though he had been dropped. Her hand held him by the throat. His lips went as blue, as pendulous, as her hanging, wide tit. Where her grip tightened he went purple as a newborn's skin. The Witch's cackle had slid down into a moist smile. 'Let him go,' said Amy. The Witch reached up to Aiden's body, with her free hand. Her talons caressed his skin. 'No,' Amy said. She couldn't see her own face. If she had, she would see her eyes milking over. Not white, but like a chocolate milkshake. Going brown and blank and deep and thick. If she had looked down, she would have seen her clothes begin to fray at their edges, to rise up, to make the smallest of fingers of the cotton, whispering lips of the hems. There was a sound like the rumour of a storm. The Witch giggled. 'He's mine. No-one can take him away from me.' Outside the lounge window, there was the roaring of a building wind. It had the look of a tornado being born. If it was screaming, Amy could understand. The Witch's fingers stopped moving, relaxed, and the little boy cried. The coffee table, on the ceiling, took off and shattered against the mantle piece, sending cards clattering across the artex. The television fell off its stand and broke into fragments of moving pictures. They set to whirling. The Witch was shouting, making herself heard above the tempest in Amy's ears. 'Think about it girl. Think about it, eh? Do you really think anything you do here does anything in the real world? Anything at all? Do you think any of this is really happening? Haven't you noticed you look the same as you always did? Haven't you noticed you're just as ugly as you always were? You're away with the bloody faeries, you little shite! How many times do you have to be told?' A window exploded, the bits of it fell outward and, in a swirl, the moving pictures of what was left of the T.V. set joined them. It looked, as it whirled past, like Eastenders. 'You've been reading too many fucking books! I can't be killed. Only I or my minions do the killing, here.' 'Witch,' shouted Aimee. 'Do you know the last thing to go through your mind when you die from falling? I read it in a book.' She didn't wait for an answer. 'Your spine ' so you will kill you.' The Dark Tower Block shifted and made a cracking sound. There was a wrench and the floor felt free. The Witch reached out to her. 'You will stop this nonsense right now! I and my line will never die and never end! Who do you think you are, Alice in Bloody Wonderland?'' CRACK. CRACKLE The electricity went out as the Dark Tower Block detached itself from its power grid. Barnaby and what was left of the Doll fell to the chequered floor. What was left of the Doll was her skin, like popped balloons at the aftermath of a children's party. Dozens of smaller figures, draped with her organs and dunked in her blood, turned away from the Bear and stared up the stairs. In an eager rush of limbs and grinding maws, they ascended, taking the stairs from underneath and swarming toward the Witch's penthouse. Barnaby stepped from a black to a white tile ' to follow them ' but paused. Through the latice-worked security doors to the foyer, he saw the world begin to move, not away, but downward, as though it hid, crouching like a toddler, from his sight. He knew what the girl had done. Barnaby smield", "label": 1}
{"text": "and looked up after her and said, 'Well done, Amy.' He ran and, not bothering to stop for the large, square disabled button on the door's right, he shattered through the glass. Arms raised above his head as though a samurai without a sword, Barnaby leapt from the concrete step to the barren, desert earth that was receding away from the Tower, as it dropped into the Underhill. With a crunch of sand and a roll, he made it. 'This is my house, young lady, and while you are under my roof you will do as I say.' The roof is under us, thought Amy. There was the CR' of a crack, then silence, as there was nothing left to rend. The Dark Tower Block, hanging upside down in the underhill, had fallen off its foundations. Outside, in the windows, the rest of the world was going up. The Witch turned to look. Hand falling open as her mouth did, she let go of Aiden, who was near enough, now, for Amy to catch him. Outside the door, a horde of footsteps and screams could be heard, if Amy had been listening. The little girl hugged the boy, and looked down. His cries stifled, and he looked at her, eyes round as a world or two. 'I brought down the tower,' she said, to him. He didn't respond. Unseen by Amy, the Witch continued to stare out of the window as the Dark Tower Block hit the ground. There was a flash of white light, as pure as fire, then darkness that looked an awful lot like a dreamless sleep, or so Amy imagined. The CRACKING sound flooded out across the Latter Wood. Above it, a crevasse appeared through the centre of the Witch's moon, which gradually, before the eyes of birds and small creatures and the trees, became a Half Moon. 'Hear that?' said the Longworm, who had not been watching, on account of having no eyes. 'Aye,' said the Notsolongworm. 'The Witch is dead.' He stretched and yawned. 'Do you think that means this world will fade away?' 'Fade away! Why?' 'The girl is finished here. She won't come back.' The Longworm turned, increduality showing up in the curl of every section of his body. 'You young idiot! Don't you think other children will need to come here? This world doesn't revolve around you, and it didn't revolve around her!' The Notsolongworm struck the earth with his tail. 'Stop calling me an idiot, you stupid old sod. You don't know anything - I could get more wisdom from squeezing a slug!' The Longworm settled back. It wasn't visible, but he was smiling. He liked it when the young were cheeky to him, even if they weren't supposed to have cheeks at all. The corridors and classrooms of the Night School were empty and silent. The carpets had been deep-cleaned, the displays stripped from the walls, the toilets fixed and cleaned. The Night School was ready for the next year of entrants, and always would be. Outside, in the Latter Wood, as dawn made a misty soup inbetween the trees, a lilac dressed figure could be seen dancing. Her face was hidden in the mist, her arms were outsteched and delicate, seeming to thin at their ends, like clay worked on a wheel, tapering as she span. Her mousy hair bunched and jumped as she sang 'Somewhere Over The Rainbow'. To her side, unseen by her, on the blind side of a bough, a heart and a scratched 'Aimee' faded from view, as though the tree's bark was healing a wound. Amy woke, her arms around Barney. The bear's head was wet. He had been crying, or she had been, in her sleep. She shivered in the way of skin telling the body good news. The Witch was dead. Goosebumps rang out like church bells. Ding. Dong. Amy smiled and gripped the bear. 'Thank you, thank you,' she said, low, into his ear. 'You're always there for me.' He felt weary to her, as tired as she felt, but he lived. Deep in his innards, the warmth of a heart beat. Sequestered in her dreams, in some bower, or below a holly bush, or in the roots of a tree, he would be hunkered, recovering. How many times had he sacrificed himself for her? Never before had there been such an old, battered bear. Amy felt, like him, exhausted to the core. She closed her eyes and slept, a smile shafting sunnily across her mouth. Aidan was safe. She had saved him. Her dreams were empty and black, like arms pulling a face into a bosom, a maternal breast, a heart that pulsed with love. Healing spread, passage by passage, through her veins and arteries. This deep in slumber, she did not dream that she could ever awake again, but wake she did' ' To the sound of Aidan's door opening. Then, she could hear Aidan's door closing. It moved across the ill-fitted, cheap carpet in hitches, like an asthmatic's death rattle. They were in Aidan's room. They were Mam and Uncle Chris. Amy was standing on the landing without realising she had risen. Barney was not in her arms. Amy walked to Aiden's door, and fell, softly, to her knees. They wouldn't hear her. They were talking. Aiden cried out. 'Put a bloody pillow over him. Don't want to wake the bloody neighbours.' Mam's voice was fast as excited blood. 'Aye,' said Chris. 'Aye, aye, aye aye.' Aiden's cry increased then ended. Amy made a patch of deeper dark on the carpet as her she lay on her side. She reached toward the door and touched it with her fingertips, but she could as much open it as she could save her baby, in the real world. 'You fucking little bastard, you fucking little bastard,' Uncle Chris was saying, in rhythm. Amy got up, then, and walked down the stairs. She walked through the lounge, then the kitchen", "label": 1}
{"text": "and, after taking the key beside the cooker, the patio doors. She strode down the garden path to the Laburnum tree that overhung the gate. As she walked she sang, softly, Somewhere Over The Rainbow. In the streetlights the pods were yellowy orange and fluorescent as two-penny sweets. 'Birds fly over the rainbow,' she whispered, 'why - oh why - can't I?' She reached and took clumps of the seeds, and ate. They tasted of cloying, of being trapped. Fingerfulls became fistfuls but they, sappy and mulched, would not gulp down her throat. She retched up over the roots, and her snot and tears joined the dark splatters on its bough. Amy tried to eat again, but the pods wouldn't go down. Something in her throat was closed to her fingers. She rose and, still bent, walked back up to the patio doors, locked them, put the keys in the bin, and returned to her room. In the bed, lay Barney. She picked him up, and with a malicious twist of her wrist, threw him at the bookshelf. What was left of Winne the Poo scattered. The adults in the house were too busy, it seemed, to notice. Barney lay in the dark, his head unseen. 'I hate you.' Amy said. 'I should have left you in the bin.' A pause, then, 'Look at me, Aimee.' It was hard, through the tears, but she tried. 'I'm not real, Aimee. I tricked you. You tricked you. None of it was real. Your mother is right. It was all in your mind. You're even imagining this. I'm only a teddy bear ' I can't speak.' 'No,' Amy gripped her duvet and squeezed, but no wind came. She couldn't bring this house down. 'The only thing here that's real, is you.' In the shadows, as a wriggling of the dark, she saw the teddy bear smile. 'I love you Aimee, and I always will.' Amy shook her head in motions as small as her tears. 'whyareyoulyingtome?.. whyareyoulyingtome?..' she mumbled, but she knew why. 'You know what to do. I'm proud of you. You are my little Aimee.' Around the agony in her head, she managed not only nod, but also to stand. Her Mam and Chris had gone to bed. Their sleeping heads and shoulders and hands were upturned amongst the brown linen like scattered white pebbles on a river bed. In her right fist Amy gripped the front door key. This will stay down, she thought. She put it to her lips, then her tongue. It was cold as a small, dead fish. She swallowed it. Downstairs, in the kitchen, the gas hobs were on but had not yet been lit. She held her Mam's lighter in her left hand. Before swallowing the key, she had taken Aiden from his crib, cuddled him, kissed him, wrote a message in crayon and strung it around his neck. He had been bleeding slightly, and that was why he hadn't woken, she remembered thinking. Why he didn't cry, at least. He knows what happens when you cry out, she had thought. He played dead. She then took him down the stairs, through the door, and placed him, wrapped in his Spiderman duvet, on the doorstep next door. He wouldn't be there long. Her home smelt of gas. Amy walked along the space between her Mam's bed and the mirrors. The Russian Doll was an egg of shadow, in its place on the dresser. Amy prodded Uncle Chris. 'Man, what?' he said. 'Daddy, can I sleep with you?' 'Aye,' he said it without thinking, without being awake, almost. She got into bed. She didn't cuddle Uncle Chris and she didn't cuddle Barney, because he sat on the doorstep next door, with Aidan, pelt as cold in the night as potato before it's cooked. Amy had read, as she had many things, about Hiroshima. She knew about the silhouettes burnt onto walls and wondered how Uncle Chris would look. She traced the outline of his nose. On her wallpaper, in the shadows, in her dreams, it was longer ' and stronger ' than Chris'. 'You never came for me,' she said, but not to him. Unconscious, fully now, he didn't reply. 'My name's Aimee,' she said. The smell of gas was making her feel dizzy. She lit the lighter. Everything became light. It shouldn't be day There but for her, perhaps, it always would be. Motes drifted along and through slants of sunlight that came down angling through the canopy of the Latter Wood. They drifted thick, glutiness enough to be Laburnum pods, but they were not. Wearing her lilac dress, Aimee spun amongst them, as slow as their progress, and as ethereal, as though - between the sunbeams - she did not exist at all. She danced, and the sun touched her bare, translucent shoulders. Mrs Riley of number 6 woke with a BANG. 'George,' she shouted. They were both up; out of bed before realising they had been asleep. 'Earthquake,' her husband shouted back. 'Fire,' she screamed, in return. Somewhere, a child joined in. There had always been strange noises from number 4, but nothing like this. This was hard to ignore. The next moments passed as if Mrs Riley hadn't woken. She ran out of the bedroom. Downstairs. The little boy on the front steps. The beige, battered teddy bear next to it. The boy, quick as maternal instinct, was in her arms. Equally quickly, she picked up the teddy and pressed it to his grip. George was banging on their door. No response. The roof was caved in, the upper storey collapsed like a disapproving frown. Someone shouted 999. The street was gathering. Everyone moved to its end. Men took charge. Number 4's downstairs window exploded like a smoker's cough. Blue lights and crimson fire engines. Mrs Riley looked down at the little boy. He had red marks around its throat and down his chest, which were both exposed. Hung around the pinkened", "label": 1}
{"text": "skin was a piece of paper on a line of string. On the sheaf, in crayon and in a child's hand, were written the words, 'Do Not Touch'. The boy was cuddling the teddy bear and twitched, as though dreaming. Mrs Riley didn't know how he could sleep through this. The Half Moon was rising through the arbor of the Latter Wood's canopy. The Witch's Moon would not, at least for now, and the wood was darker than it had been, for a long time. The Laburnum pods responded to the moon by a slight shaking, as though stretching off the long, hard day that had gone before. Aidan stared up between the curled fingers of wood at snatches of white, distant, cross-hatched moon. He squinted. There was a movement in the shadowed undergrowth but Aidan did not dare look. He did his best to scrunch up his hands and his resolve and not darken the azure robes he wore. It was the Bear. He was scared of the Bear. 'Come on,' said Barnaby, reaching out with a paw. Aidan would not yet take it, and it would be several weeks before he would, but he followed the Bear through the wood. 'It's time to go to school,' said Barnaby. Part 4 Chapter 1 IN WHICH THE WITCH IS DEAD Aidan stared down the bed at his daughter, Amy. She was already asleep, having been read Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone. Aidan had read her favourite chapter; 'The Boy That Lived' J.K. Rowling's book hadn't been around when Aidan was small though the teddy bear had been, and a school, and a vast, dark wood. It felt like he had dreamed the latter. (He hadn't needed to go to the Night School for long, before the dreams of it faded. Even before this, the memory of his real parents had done so, though never the memory of Amy.) Aidan smiled and ran his hand down the bristles on his chin. His daughter's bedroom was warm and cosy and the soft smile on her shadow-vague face spoke of a happiness like that his childhood held, for as long as he could remember. He didn't close the door, as he went to his room and his wife, but left a shaft of the landing-light on the white cupboard. Despite this, he didn't see that the teddy bear's smile was widening. Decades later, he was still alive to see little Amy, when she grew up, hand on Barney to his grandson, but died before Barney was passed from that generation to the next, or to generation that followed. Barney's smile never lost so much as a stitch, and he never needed to be Barnaby again.", "label": 1}
{"text": "the little girl sank her head into. To Amy, this was when she was at her best looking. Small children have a manner of lying; head down, arms gated, bottom in the air. Amy did not lie this way, but lay on her side, back against the wallpaper, head twisted and forced into the duvet cover. Her fingers held her ribcage as though restraining the ache within it. She had wondered how they felt, in Alien. She wrapped her palms around the outside of her arms and felt the fine, pre-pubecent, blonde hairs there. They were insubtantial, ghosts rubbed up the wrong way but unable to take revenge. Unlike them, Amy felt entirely present, and no longer able to leave. Her chest and throat burnt and her hands twisted, becoming rigid; grasping an outline that had gone. Amy did not cry but gunge collected in her nostrils and ran down onto her upper lip. The spume collected like rain in the mossed gutter at the back of the house. It overflowed. CRACK. Her head righted itself, and the crack of her neck, loud to her bones as a house torn off its foundations, brought Amy back to herelf. Pain swirled around her nape and into her skull, clawing at her scalp, and seeming to scratch up the bedroom wall, the Argos cupboard, the blonde brothers on the Bros poster, all from the darkness in her eyes. The third member of the band was too dark to yet be visible. Momentarily, Amy wished she hadn't moved. She liked being vacant. When her Mam wasn't watching Coronation Street, or Neighbours, or Eastenders, Amy would watch BBC2. She liked programs about outer space. The motion of the stars, constellation playing hide-and-seek with constellation, out through the coldness of time, never getting close enough to tig each other. Amy blinked and wiped her nose on her forearm. The hairs plastered to her skin. She turned, opened her door and tipped forward onto her toes, to stare down over the bannister at the bottom of the stairs. She could hear laughter. As always, in her house, it was the T.V. In his room, she could hear Aidan playing with something unidentified, and plastic. He was growling. Amy descended the steps singly, toes curled around the blunt edges of the carpet, nails presed into the forest-canopy-colouring of its weave. She moved as they did in The Evil Dead, careful not to snap any twigs, in case a tree snapped them back. She stood at the door to the lounge. 'Yeah, right,' her mother said. 'Idiot.' Amy stilled. Her Mam didn't move, facing the television screen. Its glow embalmed her features. 'You're just a useless dosser.' The Television said something and her Mam snorted. Amy walked by, behind the settee. If she saw Amy, her Mam would ask for a cuddle. Amy knew what a cuddle led to. She tiptoed, careful to look like she wasn't creeping. Her Mam did not turn round, and Amy's toes touched lino as she made the kitchen. She turned right, past the round, faux-pine table. The patio-door key hung on a mahogany rack behind and to the right of the cooker. 'You little shiiiite,' said her mother. Amy's blood did not freeze, but condensed to her cheeks, where it scalded as it settled. 'What do you know?' The Television didn't answer back. That was sensible. Amy took the keys. She walked to the patio door, inserted them, turned the lock, slid it open, and eased out. The patio slabs were cold and tugged at the skin of her feet. At the bottom of the garden, before the fence by the road, stood a laburnum tree, wizened by too many summers. The chains of its pods were burnished, rusted by spots of rot. 'Symtoms of laburnum poisoning may include intense sleepiness, vomiting, convulsive movements, coma, slight frothing at the mouth and unequally dilated pupils,' it said in her Flora and Fauna book. It'll be saying that to a bin-bag, now, thought Amy. At the corner of the house was the bin, its lid tilted open, an arm of creamy beige hanging out like when Mam had a bath. She could not see Barney's face. For the first time, Amy felt anxious. She could tell, because her feet twitched, her heels coming together as though she were Dorothy. Got to be quick, she thought. Or; hurry up you useless little brat. It was difficult to tell who speaking inside her head. Sometimes her own voice, on the inside, sounded like her Mam. She stretched, reaching for and past the bear's brown patch of paw. Her finger bushed his bumpy, rough, eczemic skin. Too many children had cried on him. The paw was warm. She couldn't grasp its blunt width, or she would leave this world and this body behind, and she couldn't physically reach beyond it, nor just jump and pull. The bin would fall, with a corrugated, metallic crash that would carry into the fragile, egg-like air of her home. Tears pulled down the corner of Amy's eyes, curtaining her sight. She jiggled back and forth and stubbed her shin on a bin bag. She hissed. The black, inscrutable plastic was hard, full of books and their sharp spines. (It couldn't be Winnie the Pooh; Barnaby said he didn't have a spine. Besides which, Winnie was one of the few reference books left in her bookcase. Maybe because it was a gift from Granny.) Grasping and bent to her hips, she pulled the bag close to the bin, climbed on top of the Flora and Fauna cover she could see through a noose of bag, opened the bin-lid, and pulled Barney out by his right shoulder. He had a piece of cotton on his nose. It was damp and going mouldy and looked like a bogie. Amy didn't care and didn't move, holding Barney for several seconds, pressing his scalp to her chin and up to the peak of her nose, taking", "label": 1}
{"text": "him in. He still smelt of her. Amy remade her footsteps to the patio doors. In reverse, she slid through the glass panes, closed and locked them, and replaced the keys. She walked behind the sofa. When her mother wanted to ignore her, she really could ignore her, and had done so for days, at times, hours lying end on end like fallen dominoes. Amy continued up the stairs that led back to her bedroom. Aidan's door was open a crack and the little girl let her sight fall into it. On the wall, lit by the diminishing light, was a monster in shadows - eight armed and hunchbacked. Aidan had changed from his school uniform into his spider costume. It had six felt arms and all of them clawed as two moved. Aidan was hidden behind the door. 'Buzz, buzz,' said her baby brother. 'I'm gonna eat you up, Fly-bot-tron. I'm Manspider and I'm gonna eat eat eat you up, yum, yum, yah.' The velvet limbs raised a plastic-etched shadow across the Spiderman wallpaper. Amy shifted so she could watch him. Surrounded as it was by the think, hairy face of his spider costume, his mouth was a stormcloud within cutouts of darkness. 'Fly in my spider belly. The Mummy eats me. Spider in the mummy's belly, fly in the spider's belly. Mam'Mam- me.' Amy walked toward him. The carpet crinkled under her tread. Barney was limp in her arms. Aidan scissored the spider toy in his hand. She could see it now; a Wooloworth's bin-gift, tattoed with stickers, moulded in gaudy purple and tawdry grey. Aidan bit the air. His voice changed. 'Buzz, buzz, you can't eat me. I'm Fly-bot-tron. I knew you were going to be-a-tray me. But you can't be a tray! You're a spider!' 'Aidan?' said Amy. She held Barney toward him. It wasn't the first time she had done so, and Aidan ignored her. She always took the bear back at night, while he slept. 'Aidan,' she repeated. 'Yum. Yar.' 'You need him,' Amy said, 'to stop her doing it to you.' She pushed him against the 'skin' of his spider arm. 'Take him to bed. It will stop her,' she said, pushing the teddy. Aidan shied back and away. 'Silly bear,' said the little boy, 'silly stinking bear.' 'SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU STUPID LITTLE SHIT.' The words had left Amy before she realised they were behind her lips. For a moment, she thought someone else had shouted them. Aidan crinkled. He opened his human mouth, surrounded by silhouttes of spider-black felt, and wailed. 'Maaaaammmmm.' 'I'm sorry,' said Amy. She wrapped Barney back up against her chest. 'Maaammmmm.' 'Shut up, both of you, or I'll knock your stupid heads together.' Their Mam's voice came from below. Though she was shouting, they sounded less loud than Mam did in Amy's brain. Amy ran along the landing to her bedroom. She shut the door and crawled under her bed, into the shadows in the far corner, depositing Barney. She wiggled back out, then tugged the bed by degrees away from the wallpapered wall. Amy rolled over the linen, reached down between bed and wall, grasped Barney' paw and wedged it into the gap. She rolled back, and pushed the bed flush to the wallpaper, Barney's paw protruding, unseen, beneath the duvet. It would give her something to hang onto, when she needed to let go. Chapter 2 IN WHICH AMY DOES SOME POISONING, SOME DETECTIVING, AND AIMEE DOES SOME MAGIC They walked to school in silence, a human hand in a bear's paw. Around them could be heard the pitter patter of little laburnum pods. The Latter Wood was a random eco-system, weather-wise, and tonight it was doing Autumn. To the North, it was forever winter. Aimee did not go there, and nor did any school trips. Health and Safety would never have allowed it. That was the realm of the Witch. Aimee and the bear trudged past a tree she knew well, even in the shadows. On the other side of its bough was a carving of a large heart, in which had been etched the name 'Aimee', with a smaller heart to dot the head of the 'i', and an accent over the final 'e'. At its end was the kiss of an 'x'. On her first trip here, Amy had carved it, and had transformed, from the clean brown curl of her hair to the toes of her red shoes. Abruptly, there was a whispered sound different from that of the falling seeds only in that it went on for longer. There was no wind. The bear stopped and the skin at the back of its right paw bristled against her arm. Aimee turned, staring behind and through their connection into a gloom seeded by yellow pods bleached to white by the lack of light. The scene had switched to the look of a blizzard, a snow globe upturned and returned. At first, her eyes refused to see it, as they did from time to time, but soon its pale form wisped between two trees. She had seen them before. The form was half a head taller than Aimee, with skin pallid as a child's teeth. 'Is that a boy?' she said. The Bear muttered in reply, almost to himself; 'Nothing is what it looks like it appears to be, and fewer things are what they seem.' 'Eh?' The bear pulled her forward, Barnaby's muscles bristling as his pelt had above them. 'I've told you not to stare, girl,' he said. Aimee, however, continued to do so, having as little control of her eyes as she had over the motion of her feet. 'It's another child,' said the gargoyle. 'Really, dear Witch, what is a child doing here?' said the gargoyle perched on the other end of the gates. 'This is a school.' 'Oh, that's why they all come,' the second gargoyle attempted to turn. He winced, the scales around his lizardine", "label": 1}
{"text": "Cereal Killers The legs of Loopy the Bee burred in his sleep. The bee dreamt of walking, as he had since being a larva. Abruptly, in Loopy's dream, he fell upwards and screamed. Loopy woke vertiginous, room-spinning, wrapped in a hive of Louis Vuitton linen, his air sacs aching, his mandibles dewed by sweat. The dream always ended this way; high in the sky and rising. There was a dim buzz in Loopy's apartment and he went to look for it, crawling out from the silk linen, and into the conditioned seventeen-degree air. Through the vents in the external wall, a swarm of bees filled the room. In the dark, they had the thick look of smoke from a warning fire. Loopy understood what they had to say; not by their sound but by their motion. These bees may have moved in different social circles but they were still his family. He knew where they lived and who owned them. They were the Honey Monster's. The bees entered his suite, forming line after line into a dance as complicated as a page of text. Anger made winter-twigs of Loopy's mandibles; loyalty was important to a bee. Get Tony. The swarm wrote across the hexagonally tiled wall. He's killing me. 'I'm coming,' whispered Loopy. He put on his helmet (Gucci) and his red cape (Armani), and looped-the-loop out of the window. 'Great,' said Tony. The tiger smoked Superkings but they seemed to do nothing to satisfy him. 'Just fucking great.' The window before them looked surprised, but not so open-mouthed as the Honey Monster would have been, when he went through it. His body made a hairy, blonde exclamation mark on the pavement below. 'He sent his bees to get me,' said Loopy the Bee. 'He told me to get you, too. He loved those bees.' On the street several storeys below, people crossed over, ignoring the body. This was no quarter for Good Samaritans, or for any other foreigner. In the financial winter of the recession, swastikas right-angled up the brickwork like the cracks in the government's budget. Shop fronts starred glassy eyed and broken as the vagrants, across at the Honey Monster. Restaurant chains took each other over, merely to survive. Pizza Hut was a burnt out shell. Burger King was dead. Only McDonalds seemed as long-lived as ever. The economy had not so much double-dipped as drowned. 'But you were already here,' Loopy said and twitched. His buzz sounded as though it had missed a beat. 'It would have taken more than one person to throw the Honey Monster out that window. He was big. Big. It would have taken two.' Loopy had a highly-strung imagination. This put him at odds with being a worker bee. He saw himself catching the killers, as Superman would. 'Yeah, it takes two,' said Tony. 'Especially to ruin his room like this.' Tony's hood eclipsed his eyes. The tiger wore it whenever he wasn't filming. Fame and money had come hard to the tiger, he had once told Loopy. They didn't deserve it, Tony had said. Not now ordinary people could afford nothing but value food. Now the family staple was cereal and they (Tony and Loopy and the Honey Monster) had become as important, as representative, to their companies as footballers to their clubs. They were the Cereal Celebs. Nobody could afford football, anymore. The tiger walked to the window. He limped. Stunt doubles played ice hockey or caught Frisbees in his adverts. He picked his way across the carpet, where cut-outs of glass winked at the walls, which responded by waving in strips of shredded wallpaper. The room was an expensive mess. The bijou wood panelling was deforested, the wall crumbling. One brick hid behind the fifty inch plasma T.V. A red lipstick smile had been daubed on the Honey Monster's family photo. 'Who do you think did it, Tony?' asked Loopy. 'The bees said 'He'.' Tony opened his lips but didn't answer, flicking his Superking out of the window. It flared before the light disappeared as the stub fell. 'Like Icarus, we do it to ourselves,' said Tony. He said this kind of thing a lot, these days, and Loopy ignored him. Before the recession, Kellogg deemed Tony a retail dinosaur, and had pulled him from the shelves. Now the tiger was a Cereal Celeb, he couldn't shake the anger at this betrayal, or the guilt at his wealth, and the feelings ate at him. They had gutted Tony from the inside to the out, until they were visible in his clothes, in his chain-smoking, in his gait. Even in his snarled, 'Great'. Loopy the Bee, however, had bigger things on his mind, though they were shadowy. Two things. 'We've got to catch them,' he said. Crackle's skateboard rattled across the mahogany boards, passing door after door of his lakeside home. Snap, Crackle and Pop had joined finances to buy the mansion, and lived together, along with fast cars, skunk, and the occasional, midget prostitute (the occasions being birthdays and advertising awards). As he rolled over the flooring, Crackle's bones rattled and not, he hoped, for the last time that night. Later, he would hook up with his celebrity friend, Coco the Monkey, and ride the strip, windows down, playing Big Pimpin' by Jay-Z. He'd pick up some girls and drive with a manicured, pink-nailed hand massaging his lap and a thick cushion under it, so he could see over the wheel. Gonna get my bones jumped, thought Crackle. Oh yeah. He rattled toward the stairs, humming Big Pimping. 'Wow,' said Crackle, interrupting himself. 'Oh, yeah, wow.' He launched his skateboard onto the wooden banister of the main staircase, grinding the curve. 'Yeah, own the spot, man.' He ran his hand through his blonde curls. 'Yeah.' The mahogany moaned as though it knew what was coming. If it did, it would have worried about getting the stains out. Crackle did not, and was unprepared for the chainsaw that opened", "label": 1}
{"text": "up his belly. It caught on his spine, as the skateboard skittered on alone. Crackle attempted to scream and would have been successful, but for the blood that spurted up his windpipe. He fell sideways. Without the skateboard, and dissected across the midriff, he was shorter than he recalled, and found himself staring up at a clown's face. It was smiling. While the face, to Crackle's failing sight, seemed to have little choice in the smile, its eyes were laughing. 'I'm enjoying this,' said the clown. Snap jumped at the snapping sound. He would have decided it had been the wind or a flapping blind, and sunk back into the haze of skunk, and into the sofa that supported him, but for the gnashing of a chainsaw's teeth. Breaking bones, Snap thought and rose. The marijuana haze was congealing into a mire. His preferred method of transport, off screen, was his pogo-stick. His fingers spidered across the settee cushions, seeking it as a blind man would his cane. The lounge door opened. It didn't have the good grace to creak, but Snap could feel the swell of new air. It felt like his bowels opening. At three foot seven, Snap was too short to see over the settee, even if he could force himself to look. Despite his height, his head and body were in perfect proportion, with exceptionally photogenic cheeks, but his fear was not. His fear was built like a brick shit house. 'Sausages,' someone said. Snap was sure it wasn't Crackle, or Pop, who shared the mansion with him. 'You're lots of sausages.' 'I'm not.' Snap swooned, swaying on the spot, unsure if he was running. He meant to be. He spotted his pogo-stick in the corner of the room, leaning against the drinks cabinet. Drunk, he thought. 'But I've got money. I'm rich. I could pay you not to' I could pay you'' 'Rich sausages' Fatty,' the voice said. 'I really do like the taste of them.' Giggle. Perhaps it was the skunk, but a yellow-dungareed clown with red hair, red shoes, and red lips stood beside the sofa's arm. The cushions seemed to recoil from the clown's chainsaw, which was also crimson. It turned laconically, its teeth spotted with blood and smeared with rust, and wonky as those of a sugar-addicted child. The chainsaw looked like it had been gnawing on dense, integral bones. 'Do I know you?' said Snap. Pop's heart sprinted as he stared at the phone. He wished he had stayed in the washing machine, as he had for the last hour, exercising his love of pornography and trying not to stain his velvet, blue jacket. The washing machine was his happy place. Elsewhere, he felt unclean when he masturbated. While Crackle and Snap were butchered, Pop learnt all about Fania Rustoff's love of cream, muttering 'put that on your rice krispies, put that on your rice krispies,' as he did so. He hadn't heard the chainsaw, not until he slid out of the washing machine and into the kitchen. Now, instead of naked women, Pop gazed longingly at the phone by the rotisserie. He reached out. His first thought, at least beyond I'm going to die, I'm going to die, was not of the police. The force was stretched, these austere days, as thin as skimmed milk over cereal. No, only one man was big, strong, and hairy enough to save Pop. The receiver creaked as Pop picked it up, as if a floorboard in a horror movie. He dialled. 'Hello,' said the phone, in his ear. 'Honey Monster?' whispered Pop. 'No, it's Tony,' said the phone. The world darkened. The light scattered and hid in its niches. 'Is something trying to kill you?' said Tony. 'Yes,' said Pop, quick, but not quickly enough to stop the tears. 'I'm coming.' Pop hung up. He could no longer hear the chainsaw. The phone rang. Pop jumped. Pop clutched at it, knocking the receiver onto the floor. The floor boards creaked as he reached, as they did in horror movies. He couldn't stop thinking about horror movies. 'Yes?' It was Tony. 'Stay away from the phone. The murderer knows you'll call for help.' 'Thanks, Tony,' said Pop. The tears were more availing, now. He was bent double and at this height - about one foot eight inches - he could stare at the clown's long red shoes. He wondered how the clown kept them so clean and shiny, what with all the blood. Pop's nose was sharp; his eyes had sunk, the temples fallen in about them. The skin of his face had faded to a dusk where shadows gathered in the hollows. His stomach was empty, cut below the ribcage and down to the hip-bone. Beside his corpse, in equal rows, lay sausages, made, it seemed, from every morsel of bone and flesh. They didn't look altogether wholesome. Bent over Pop was Tony. The tiger's hood circled his ears in a shadow of anti-halo. Tony picked up the phone in his right paw. The receiver was patted with blood. Loopy the Bee flew from one end of the hall to the other, hearing only the sound of his own buzzing. The noise crawled in his head as if it were a hive about to swarm. 'I'm going to find the murderer. He won't be able to catch me. He won't be able to kill me,' said Loopy the Bee. He flew so fast his buzzing sounded as though it were chasing him, from hall, to lounge, to billiard room, to pool, to the garage where Snap, Crackle and Pop kept their Ferraris and old Aston Martins. He saw the body of Snap, and of Crackle, and the sausages beside both, thin and wet and red as any herrings. Loopy's body curled into a fist of gold rings and shadowed black stripes, yearning for someone to hit. His sting was ready. Then, Loopy saw the murderer; the clown. Before the killer; he saw", "label": 1}
{"text": "Tony. They stood close to each other in the hall, and they were talking. 'Those people only care if you're famous,' Tony the Tiger was saying. 'They only care if you're on T.V.' The tiger was sneering. Loopy, as though in a dream, saw more than what was before him. He saw Tony already at the Honey Monster's apartment, before Loopy flew there. He saw the message from the Honey Monster; Get Tony. He's killing me. It wasn't a cry for help; it was a call for revenge. Get Tony ' he's killing me. His imagination was big, for a bee, and he could see the clown throwing the Honey Monster out of a window. The clown and Tony. He saw the killers. 'He told me and I didn't want to believe,' said Loopy, to himself. It sounded like a growl. 'What?' Tony turned from the clown. The clown smiled at them both. 'It's not the kind of thing a bee would believe.' 'I don't under'' 'But I'm more than any old bee, you bastard.' Loopy flew, enveloped by his buzz, spinning up like an upper cut into Tony's eye. His stinger dug in. Tony screamed and fell to the floorboards. Loopy fell also, spent. The bile was gone. He stared lopsidedly as the clown walked over to the tiger. 'You Cereal Celebs,' said the clown. 'Ronald doesn't care about fame, only demographic penetration.' His chainsaw started then went round and round. 'Grrreeeeeaaaat, isn't it?' He pushed it into Tony. The chainsaw caught on the tiger's blue, pneumonic-looking nose, making it red in a splurge. Tooth by tooth, the metal rounded Tony's oblique face and hollowed his eye, as if scooping butter and raisin ice-cream. It wasn't the eye Loopy had stung, but the other one. The bee could see bone and, momentarily, the tiger's eye-socket seemed to be chewing on the weapon. The clown giggled ' at the absurdity of it all, the bee supposed. Tony reached up, claws fanging out, pawing at the blade. The chainsaw took off his nails, then his fingers and, before Tony gave up, his wrist. The stump made potato prints on the metal. Ronald McDonald placed his right, long, red shoe on the tiger's shoulder and pulled out the chainsaw. It chortled in the air; the teeth free once more. Tony the tiger, meanwhile, edged away, no longer limping but crawling across the floor. 'Animal slaughter!' giggled Ronald and brought the chainsaw down on his spine. Lumbar and metal gnashed at each other like an awkward kiss, and then the metal was through, emptying the big cat's guts on the floor, first in worming lines, then in a mound. Funny, thought Loopy as he watched, but this wasn't how I imagined justice would look. He looked away. The lights of Loopy the Bee's life were going out one by one. His Armani cape shrouded his body. It felt as though his skin were trembling, until he realised it was the floor, and somebody walked toward him. Loopy stared out through the lack of light in his eyes, and saw the Honey Monster. The monster shook the clown's hand. 'Funny, he, he, hee ' smashing flat, bricking window, lying on pavement ' look what it do. He, he, hee,' said the Honey Monster. 'And stupid bee, honey, honey, honey.' The clown's cheeks were red, as was the rest of his face. His dungarees were smeared. The clown spoke in a low, raspy voice. 'Yes, you fulfilled your contract. Sugar Puffs will be sold in our branches.' 'You talked to tiger. What he say?' said the Honey Monster. 'He said I was only a plastic toy. He said people didn't care about me because I'm not on T.V. He said people couldn't remember my name. He was upset. I smiled to keep him speaking, until the bee returned, as we agreed.' The Honey Monster stared down at Loopy. 'Little bee hard to catch. Him kill himself. Only way, he, he, he,' said the Honey Monster. Loopy felt wizened as an insect on a windowsill in November, hanging close by the light and the warmth, looking in. His sight had gone. His hearing thought about going after it. 'Yes, I see.' The clown's rasp was clipped. 'Mr Monster?' 'Uh-Huh?' 'Do you really think we'd sell your cereal in our branches? No. We'll sell own brand Sugar Puffs. I don't want your leftovers. I want the full breakfast. And you're right; it is funny where lying gets you, especially to your friends.' The chainsaw made a hacking sound as it started, as if clearing its throat to speak. Loopy didn't hear what came next. The bee swelled once more and stilled, as his heart froze. 'Mr' Phileas' Fogg?' 'Yes,' Coco the Monkey said and scratched his tail against the inside of his striped shirt, where the tail was hidden. He felt eyes on the back of his head, as sharp as the teeth of a chainsaw. He didn't dare turn to look. The passport official, metal-straight but curved at the shoulders from a career of peering, had the look of a paperclip on too thick a ream. His eyes bulged at the passport, then at Coco. 'You have a lot of stamps, Mr' Fogg,' he said. 'Yes,' Coco said. The monkey fidgeted and, by way of his sleeve, steadied his arm with his tail. 'Well, this all seems to be in order,' said the official. Coco smiled. The passport was the best fake that money could buy. It had taken him from country to country, until he was no longer sure where he was. It was Namibia, or Ghana, or somewhere or other in Africa. He hadn't been on the run for long, but he had been sprinting. The monkey left the airport, passing luggage collection and, via the car park and taxi ranks, walked into the street. He had brought nothing of his old life. No possessions, no name, no baggage. All his old friends had", "label": 1}
{"text": "been killed. 'Killed,' he repeated to himself, lighting a cigarette with fingers that would not still. Smoke rose past his eyes and nicotine rode his brain. It was a recent habit, begun on the day the newspapers had headlined CEREAL-CELEB SUICIDE PACT and peppered the article with the words: Fame, Riches, Shame, and Sausages. Tony the tiger, now there was somebody who could top themselves, who could fall on their own chainsaw, thought Coco. But not Snap, Crackle, or Pop. Not The Honey Monster and especially not Loopy. He wouldn't commit suicide. Coco, the last of the Cereal Celebs, walked out into the crowd, thinking as he did that someone, somewhere, was getting away with murder. Whoever it was, thought Coco, wouldn't get him. The monkey smoked and walked briskly. At a distance behind him, in the gaps between the crowded humans, flitted a cheek of pale skin, curls of red hair, and a mouth curled by red lipstick. 4", "label": 1}

Those same people say there should be Her-Story; history without so much of the he/him. What I know is that there is a whiff-story, and it is powerful, and hangs around in the air while all of the otherwise important parts of history/her-story happened. We don\u2019t talk about it; the farts. We don\u2019t mention the farts that were there when Henry VIII\u2019s wives were divorced, died, or (for the final wife) survived. But, looking at Henry VIII (and considering all the meat wrapped in pastry he ate) , those farts were there, and his last one was, I suppose, vile enough to make the last wife wish she hadn\u2019t. There\u2019s a saying in sport: \u2018squeaky bum time\u2019. It means when players, managers and fans feel most anxious or otherwise afraid of losing. But there was never a collection of bottoms squeakier then those of the men who went over the top of the trenches in World War I. Those scared and so brave souls were no doubt cooking up their own nerve gas and whistling it out of buttocks that sounded like incoming bombs. The diets of rats and cockroaches and the occasional messenger bird they pretended hadn\u2019t reached them (but had reached their stomachs) would have made the smell of that gas about as off-putting as running into a hail of bullets.

The Grimoire of Farts The Maturing Fart [picture of a bottle of wine and a slice of cheese, both steaming with stink] Old people have sayings like: \u2018you can do that when you\u2019re older\u2019, and \u2018good things come to those who wait\u2019, and \u2018it gets better with age, like a fine wine\u2019. All of these sound worse the more they are said but they are all true of farts. In the beginning, as a baby, farts are as unformed as those chubby little baby faces. As babies more-or-less look just like any other baby, so their farts have yet to take on their own personality. The older the belly the more pungent and powerful the guff or puff that comes out of the bottom. You know this is true. Whose farts are worst? Just by sniffing the farts of your father, you know they are the whiffier. Please don\u2019t try this at home: pick a windswept moor where your dad\u2019s bottom-wind will whisk away like a genie after the final wish, leaving just a whiff. And please note: never sample your grandfather\u2019s farts, no matter the weather. So it was, like me, that my farts grew up, got stronger, and gained their own individual character. But even at first you could tell that my farts, while maybe not unique; were special. Even as a baby all alone in a broken home, I could knock down and send to sleep a fully grown man. \u2026 and, still as that baby that could knock down men, I could lift myself off the ground\u2026 \u2018What is that noise?\u2019 asked the Major. He tilted his head and screwed up his eyelids as if trying to listen to an insect\u2019s whisper. Outside the lounge window there was a farting sound. The Major walked to the wall to the right of the window and shimmied along it. He ducked behind one large, green, upholstered armchair, before rolling past a settee and commando crawling toward the bay windows. The Major\u2019s full name was Major Private. He was an army man, through and through. He walked \u2013 when he wasn\u2019t shimmying, or rolling, or commando crawling- with a limp. \u2018What is that I can see? Is it a baby? Is it a baby that is flying?\u2019 It was. The baby was naked. The", "label": 1}
{"text": "all the farts you could produce, but it has an earthy grittiness that says \u2018job well done\u2019, like building a good, solid wall. It\u2019s the kind of fart, in short, that makes you want to pat yourself on the back and go about your business feeling like a proud, upstanding farter. Slowly \u2013 as he read - Seb drifted off to sleep, with his Grimoire of Farts under his face. Later, because he would be asleep, he wouldn\u2019t hear the slam of the door above as the Major went out for what he normally called \u2018A Spot of War\u2019. If he hadn\u2019t been asleep, and if he had of heard, the sound of it wouldn\u2019t have surprised Seb at all. That Night The Next Morning Sebastian left the bottom floor flat and made sure the door was locked, as Major Private was still out at War. Seb trudged up from the bottom of the hill to the bus stop at its top. On his back he carried his school rucksack. The bag was heavy with library books and so Sebastian didn\u2019t have the energy for anything other than lifting and stepping and wondering. Wondering why bus journeys were always walking/bus/walking journeys. Why buses couldn't stop outside your home. And why they were always busy when he rode on them, and quiet when he didn't, like that one day he was late for school and there was only an old, strange man on board, who shouted, 'Service!', 'Drinks!' and 'Stewardess!' at the otherwise empty bus. With all this walking and wondering, he had nothing left over for noticing. He didn't notice the hooded figure who had followed him up to the bus stop. There \u2013 at the stop - Sebastian stood. Seb waited. On the bus stop was a Missing Cat poster. This, for some reason, he noticed. He stared at it. Sebastian thought, Why call your cat Matt? Why give your cat a surname? Why give your cat a surname which is the sound you make after stepping in dog poo? And Seb was about to think finally, just; Why? when the bus drew up and he had no time for thinking. He hadn't even gotten out his fifty pence piece. He didn\u2019t like to do this on the bus, in front of all the passengers, because he could always feel them staring and tutting at how long he was taking. An impatient passenger pushed by, all swishes of cloth and odours of rotted then overcooked food. Seb went red from his hairline downward and fished with a wriggling, worming finger in his pocket, and went redder, and found the money, and pushed the coin toward the bus driver, who said, \u2018You're going to school. It\u2019s free. Sit down, please.\u2019 \u2018But it\u2019s always fifty p,\u2019 said Sebastian. \u2018Sit down,\u2019 said the bus driver. \u2018It\u2019s time to go to school.\u2019 A passenger tutted. It may have been the glass window behind which the man was sat, but the driver's eyes appeared glassy and far away. \u2018Okay,\u2019 said Sebastian and sat on the first seat he could find, next to an old lady who was reading a newspaper. Her eyes, grey in the way of a t-shirt that had been washed too many times, stared over the top of the newspaper at Sebastian. Her hands on the edge of the newspaper dented the page, and were as grey as her eyes, like the claws of long dead crabs. Seb didn\u2019t take off his rucksack but sat on the bus as he always did, leaning forward, the bag pressed to the seat behind him. Normally he looked only straight ahead or out of the window at the local bike shops but today he could not help but stare at the story on the newspaper's front page. 'BREAKING AND ANT-TERING,' it read in letters thick and black. The picture below the headline looked like a swarm of ants carrying away an ancient treasure chest. Below the picture, Seb managed to read the words, 'Strange ant-ics last night as ants appeared to carry out a daring raid on the treasures of the Vatic-ant City. They carried many priceless relics and ant-tiques into the catacombs below the Pope's home. It remains to be seen what \u2013 or who- is making these ants act this way...'' The old lady suddenly said, \u2018Are you going to school?\u2019 Sebastian jumped on his seat as though the bus had driven over a bump in the road. He glanced nervously at the old woman. She had white hair above the white eyes and white hands, and thin, bloodless lips. Seb gulped. He nodded. \u2018Good,\u2019 said the old lady. \u2018It\u2019s about time.\u2019 Sebastian nodded again. Either it was her glasses, or her eyes looked strangely glassy and far away. Seb was beginning to think it wasn\u2019t her glasses. Just as he was beginning to think this, the bus turned onto the main street leading out of town, and headed toward his stop. Thank God, he thought, and got up. The old lady, as he did so, made a grab for him with a hand that was \u2013 as it made contact- as hard as that dead crab\u2019s claw. \u2018It\u2019s the next stop,\u2019 she hissed, holding him. The doors were open and only three people were getting off. Sebastian squirmed and \u2013 almost instinctively- gave off what he called his Emergency Fart. As Paddington always kept a marmalade sandwich under his felt hat for times of emergency, Sebastian kept a bottom burp just inside his butt cheeks. This was just one of those times. His fart was just as fruity. It propelled him out of the old lady\u2019s crab hand and down the aisle of the bus and out of the bus doors as they were closing. As he left the bus, the driver shouted, 'It\u2019s the next stop!\u2019 and braked the bus to a halt. He jabbed at his buttons, opening the doors again and pointed for Sebastian to get back on.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Sebastian stared incredulously as several of the passengers of the bus stood and pressed themselves \u2013 pale and desperate as zombies - against the glass of the window before him. They all pressed their lips against the pane and smeared drool as they said, as one, 'It's time to go to school'. Seb shook his head. It had been a head shaking kind of morning. The next stop was opposite the library where he would go and wait at the end of the school day. He didn\u2019t want to go there, now. Not yet. It's time to go to school, he thought. 'Yes,' he said and turned and walked that way, and away from the strange bus and its weirder passengers. School Time Seb walked down the main street. He turned right past the bank on the corner and down the road to Tricksy Pork Primary School. He crossed the road because they were building on the left hand side and the builders would leer at Seb and push him out of the way of the white vans they ahd parked there, up on the pavement. He walked past the park and the shops, and turned right down an alley that led to the gates of the school. At the gates stood Miss Pellen. She was staring at him. Or perhaps, thought Seb, through him. \u2018This isn't your school anymore,\u2019 Miss Pellen said. \u2018It's time to go to your school.\u2019 \u2018Um,\u2019 said Sebastian. \u2018But\u2026\u2019 Miss Pellen pointed back toward the alley. \u2018You can't pass. It\u2019s time to go to school.\u2019 \u2018Look,\u2019 tried Sebastian. 'I\u2019m sorry I talk in your lessons. I keep trying to remember not to. I'm sorry I cheated in your spelling test... even if you didn't know I did that... I keep doing things I know I'm not supposed to do, I know. But it's only to make people laugh. please let me come in. This is my school. I want to stay.\u2019 Suddenly Miss Pellen shouted. \u2018THIS ISN'T YOUR SCHOOL ANYMORE. IT'S TIME TO GO TO SCHOOL.\u2019 She was pointing, still, and whitening with rage and walking toward him; growing in his sight; the ghost of a giant now. Sebastian backed away, and continued stumbling backward until he reached the alleyway, the end of which Miss Pellen now blocked. Her shouted words had merged together until they become one long, loud, warbling, inchoate scream. In the wind the scream created, Miss Pellen\u2019s bogie-sail tremored once then flew off. It landed in a broken bottle. Shaking his head and balling his fists so that he did not weep- keeping his eyes pinned wide open - Sebastian stumbled back up the alley, took a right past the shops, walked by the park, crossed the road, and took a left past the bank, and onto the pavement of the high street. All this he did without blinking, all without realising he was walking at all. It was up the hill from here to his bus stop and he was halfway to this before he realised where he was. He blinked. His eyes felt heavy but not as heavy as his brain, which was weighed down with questions. Some, like, Why do people keep saying it\u2019s time for school? And, What is wrong with people\u2019s eyes this morning? Were new questions. Some of the questions, though, were as old as Seb and were always there, underneath whatever other questions he happened to be thinking, Tricksy Pork Library His bus stop was in front of the library but on the other side of the road. At the end of the school day, Seb would wait in the library and watch for his bus from the library window. He felt safe in the library. Sometimes, he would miss two or three buses just to stay in the quiet, and under the books. He often felt they glowed, that they might give him a sun-tan, pale as he was. Whenever an adult asked him what Seb would do when he's older, Seb would firstly think; well, I'll be older in a minute's time, and I'll probably still be answering questions about what I'll do when I'm older, then. Then, he would think; well, I'd like to be a librarian. They always said that books could take you to far-away places so Seb thought librarians must travel all the time, and have very exciting lives. At the very least, all that travelling would make him forget his questions, for a while. Now, in the door to the library, there was another missing pet poster, with another question. (Have you seen this cat? His name is Mat.) Seb pushed open the door, walked past the poster, staring at it as he passed. For some reason, it made his mind repeat the question, 'What happened to them?' Fully inside the library, he breathed in and out one long, contented sigh. It was met with a 'shush!'. Seb thought; Sophia. The librarian. Despite the brilliance of her job, Sophia the Librarian spent most of her working hours. 1- shushing. 2- screaming if there were any loud sounds 3- shushing herself when she heard herself scream. Or 4 - locked in the room behind the front desk that time somebody had laughed out loud whilst reading. (The book had said, in speech marks on the front cover, \u2018Laugh out loud funny\u2019. After that 'Happy Incident', Sophia had locked the book \u2013 and any other books with the same quote- away in the room behind the main desk, and labelled its door with; \u2018Dangerous Books\u2019.) Sophia was dressed entirely in black, as if she were as against loud colours as she was against loudness. Dark trousers, black high heels, a blouse the colour of a moonless night in the countryside. Her nails wouldn't have looked out of place in a beetle line-dance. Her hair was just the right colour for a raven, if a raven ever needed a wig to wear to a fancy do... a do such as", "label": 1}
{"text": "a beetle-line-dance. Sophia was currently staring at Seb, a thin, admonishing finger in front of her lips. \u2018Shuuuuuush,\u2019 said Sophia. It was her way of saying, 'Welcome to Tricksy Pork Library'. Seb walked between the shelves until nobody could see him. He unhitched his rucksack and put it down. He plucked a book from a shelf, looked at the blurb on the back, flicked through, and read some pages. He smiled. This as much as his Godfather\u2019s flat (and the bunker beneath it) was home. He looked up, through the shelves, over Sophia, and at the clock on the wall. It was a digital clock. Sophia did not approve of analogue clocks. Too much ticking; not to mention the tocking. It read, 9.30. Sebastian's smile flat-lined and he pushed his hand into his pocket. Underneath a tissue, he found the library card he had been given by the School Insector, and retrieved it. [picture of card] It was 9.31. Seb put back the book and walked to the desk. Sophia turned to him with the wide, apprehensive eyes of somebody who wasn\u2019t a fan of footsteps. \u2018I\u2019d like to\u2026\u2019 said Seb. \u2018Shussssshhhh,\u2019 said Sophia. The librarian pointed at a sign. [sign- Absolutely no talking unless there's a fire, a flood, or a zombie. In all other cases, please write me a note. Note- if there is a zombie and they have not yet noticed me, please do not pass me any notes. Signed- 'Sophia the Librarian.\u2019] Seb pulled the books out of his school bag, placed them on the counter, and put the library card on the top book. Sophia picked up the library card. Sophia stared at it. It was 9.32. Sophia lent forward over a pile of post-it notes. She picked up a pen and wrote. She handed the paper to Seb. [note- Do you have any idea how heavy that ebook is? It isn't a tablet! It's a table!!! And just when my shift was nearly over!] Seb took the pen and wrote, [same as above, in pen, SORRY!!!] Sophia turned the paper around, yelped, put her fingers to her lips and wrote \u2018Do not use capital letters on the notes!\u2019. Seb wrote, sorry. Sophia wiped a trickle of sweat from her forehead, sighed and turned around, walking into the room labelled 'Dangerous Books' behind the front desk. There was a loud BANG followed by the sound of Sophia screaming followed by the sound of Sophia shushing. She tottered back into sight carrying the largest ebook Sebastian had ever seen. Gritting her teeth, Sophia managed to lower the book onto the counter without a sound. Slowly, carefully, the librarian turned the book over and pointed at the warning on the book\u2019s back cover. Warning; do not open in confined spaces. Sophia nodded at Seb, although agreeing with something obvious they had been discussing, and Seb nodded back. He was unsure why. He picked up the ebook and staggered side-to-side as step-by-step he walked toward the children's reading room. On the third step, Sophia yelled. \u2018Out! Get out!\u2019 Seb had never heard the librarian shout. He imagined the words as if she had written them on her post-it notes. Each letter would have needed its own note. Seb didn\u2019t like to think who she was shouting so loudly at, or, as Miss Pellen would annoyingly say, at whom (or, even worse, at what) and so tottered toward the doors at the back that led to the stairs to the reading room. [strip of Seb haphazardly descending the stairs. Caption- 'The stairs were dark. Grimed over windows. Somewhere, a pipe dripped. By his inching feet, spiders scuttled, and other insects scuttle in front of them, but faster.' Panel of following. Caption- 'The sign to the Children's Reading Room hung in tattered bits, the last letters only still hanging because they were stuck on with spider webs.' Panel shows 'Child d oom'.] With a shudder, Seb lowered the ebook to the carpet. The carpet squelched. Seb breathed. Breathed again. Then did some more heavy breathing. He didn't hear the door to the main library opening, above. Seb ignored the shelves on his left. They were filled with pink and books about fairies and angels and more of the colour pink. He knew some girls who only liked pink at school and they were always the most dangerous. Seb didn\u2019t notice the end of a cloak at the top of the stairs, and a foot with skin the consistency of baked beans. He didn\u2019t hear the puckered, soft-oozing of its slow steps. Instead Seb bent and read the book\u2019s blurb. It said, simply, [in blurb, Do not open in confined spaces. On opening, try not to panic.] Under and above this were quotes from people Sebastian did not recognise. StrongBigGreenMan said, \u2018The kind of book you could lose yourself in.\u2019 FlyingLazerEyesStrongMan said, \u2018Pure escapism.\u2019 SwingingBetweenBuildingsMan said, \u2018This book is a door, a door to other worlds!\u2019 PredictTheFutureMan said, \u2018This book will get right to your core.\u2019 Seb ignored these and turned the ebook back over so that its front cover faced the ceiling. It was heavy and had a musty whiff, as Seb imagined a coffin would, or its contents. He swung the cover of the ebook open. With a soft velvet clunk, like the flap of a bat\u2019s wing\u2026 if that bat was the size of a bear... the protective material flapped to the floor. Inside, the screen turned on, and on the screen was a contents page. [Forenames of children on each page number. Sebastian is on p. 7. 'White Hat Hacker' is third. 'The Gatekeeper' is last. All the other children are written in the blue colour of links that have been clicked.] For some reason, Seb felt he shouldn\u2019t select the pages for the other children and carefully touched his own link with the tip of his finger. The names disappeared. Then, there was a loading circle in the centre of the screen which seemed to get", "label": 1}
{"text": "wider and bigger as does the swirl on a snail's shell, until Seb realised it wasn't a loading circle or a snail. It was a worm. The worm dug its way out of the screen of the ebook, pixels bulging, then cracking. Then, one or two pixels fell like clots of soil, onto the library carpet, where they shimmered green, red, blue. 'Ello,' said the worm, in a voice warm and dirty as soil in the sunshine. 'Um,' said Seb. 'Did you just say hello?' 'No, I said, 'Ello',' said the worm. After this, it said, 'Well, are you coming in?' Seb frowned. Seb stuck his finger into the air as if trying to pin down what he was thinking. It was still there- the air- and Seb found that the finger steadied the rest of his body, and his thoughts. 'Um,' he repeated. 'What are you?' 'Why, I'm a bookworm. An ebook-worm.' 'What's that?' Seb asked of the hole behind it. 'Ain't it obvious? It's me wormhole.' Seb didn't reply. It was the worm's turn to repeat himself. He sounded irritated. 'Are you coming in?' \u2018YOU\u2019RE NOT ALLOWED DOWN THERE. YOU\u2019RE NOT A CHILD!!!\u2019 The worm didn't say this. Seb didn\u2019t say this. Sophia the librarian had shouted it; the shout echoing down the stairwell. Seb picked up one of the fallen pixels of dirt. It still glowed red, green, blue. It felt gritty between his fingertips. Real. Seb didn't look up. He stared at the ebook worm, then under it, at the ebook. He bent and lifted this... ('ere, said the worm, what ya think yer doing?) \u2026 and underneath the carpet of the Children's Reading Room felt just as damp and thread-bare and like it smelt as it always did. He put the ebook back down, wiped his hand on his school trousers, and stared at the ebook-wormhole. It wasn't the size of a hole fit for a worm. It wasn't the size of a hole fit for a rabbit. It would fit a boy, nearly exactly, a boy with big, ginger hair. He knew he shouldn't do it. But he liked doing things he shouldn't do. Like cheating at tests. Like talking in class. Like farting. The hooded figure he hadn\u2019t seen earlier reached the bottom step. Seb bit his lip, but didn't feel it. He rose over the book. The door to the children\u2019s reading room opened, opened by a hand that was both adult and not human. 'I'm going in,' Seb said. The figure at the children\u2019s reading room door hissed, or its hand did, its skin slithering as it pushed the door open. It left - behind it - a trace of red; blood maybe; possibly tomato sauce. The worm shrugged, 'Welcome to me wormhole, then,' it said, then burrowed back down, reversing the circle it had made when the ebook had loaded up. \u200b Sebastian jumped after it.\u200b Into the darkness. Unsurprisingly, it was the darkness of a hole. Surprisingly, the hole got smaller and smaller as Seb fell into it, narrowing around him. Shockingly, so did Seb, shrinking, until he fell down as the hole turned into a niche and then a crack, squeezing through each, until he popped out. When he popped out, he was full-sized and lying on a concrete step. the grimoire of farts the emergency fart Appearance: Small and green like a pea, but wrinkled as well, and fluffy, like a pea that had rolled under the freezer several months ago. Taste: It doesn\u2019t, however, taste like a pea, but more like a poo; a small poo swallowed at speed. Quick but yuk. Preparation: The Emergency Fart is a side-product of all food types. Small wafts of rot build up in the intestines and gather near to the hole of the bottom. As the fart moves so quickly, it is not known if it retains any of the characteristics of the food behind it, if for instance the Emergency Fart of a pizza lover smells of cheese, or if the Emergency Fart of a fisherman smells of off cod... Farting technique: the emergency fart is available in any body position. You don\u2019t even need to point your bottom. Texture: see above. (The swallowing a bit of poo part.) Effectiveness: low, but surprising. Like a goldfish reaching out of its bowl and poking you in the eye; they can\u2019t do much damage, but the shock of it leaves you reeling for several seconds. \u2018Ouch,\u2019 Seb said as he hit the first concrete step. It felt real. Far too real. \u2018Ouch,\u2019 Sebastian repeated, several times, on several steps, until he came to a rest. The steps were dark but their edges were lit as a pumpkin's grin is lit- jagged and ominous- by a fire deep down below. From below came a rumbling sound, like that of Sebastian's stomach, a sound which always sent his godfather \u2013 the Major- running for his gas mask. Seb looked back up. Not far that way was a concrete wall. It swirled ceaselessly and crazily and gloopily as if cheap jelly spooned by a toddler. From that way came the voice of the ebook-worm, a voice as thin and straining as the voice you imagine a worm would talk in, \u2018Enjoy your first day at school!\u2019 It said. Because of the steps, Sebastion couldn\u2019t see the worm and then - with the sucking sound of a muddy worm-hole closing over - its voice was gone, also. No way back, thought Seb. He gulped. Seb stood and began - trembling - to walk downward until the concrete walls came to a crumbling end. Here were hung a pair of gas masks, like the one in his nappy bag when he was a toddler. Above these were the words 'Please wear while waiting,' and above this sign were larger words. S T O P U B Bus Stop? Seb thought, picking up and putting on one of the gas masks. He looked through the gas", "label": 1}
{"text": "mask's visor. There wasn't a bus stop sign, or a shelter. Instead, beyond the crumbled wall and at the bottom of the remaining steps was a long, underground lake. A lake of lava, from which came the rumbling. It smelt of eggs and heat, like his bottom after a curry. '\u2026 as a handbag of a dog...' Said Seb, to himself. The day felt just as mad as that. the grimoire of farts The flammable fart Appearance: Often fiery and red, but for some especially talented people, fiery and blue. Smell: Like a fart slathered in dripping, surrounded by roast potatoes, and roasted in the oven. Preparation: For the flammable fart it is best to eat meat, beans, cabbage and eggs. This has led to my culinary invention, the bean/egg/cabbage/roast chicken roulade. This is beans shoved into a boiled egg, which is buried in a cabbage. The cabbage is then inserted up a chicken\u2019s bottom, all of which are then roasted in the oven at 180 degrees for one hour and a half (add half an hour if it\u2019s a big bird, but not if it\u2019s a big cabbage.) Execution: As it is necessary to light the farts as soon as they leave the bottom-hole, it would be best to wear some pants, and to force the fart through its material. If these precautions are not followed there is a risk of burning the bottom hole. For best results, may I recommend my invention; the fart lamp, which safely stores the farts whilst they are being lit, and stops the bottom getting blisters. Note \u2013 This is not the same as farting around fire. This is firing around a fart. NEVER FART NEAR FIRE. The Lava Lake Seb watched the boat draw in, and moor, at the lake-edge. The rower rose, placed the oars inside the rowing boat, picked up a briefcase from where it had been hidden by the bow of the boat, and placed it on the edge of the lava lake. His face was pale and weary with hair that was so dull it managed to bore the eyes. He wore a black suit of straight, heavy lines, and a tie that hung in a line like a pendulum on a clock that always, always worked. That, and just as black; he wore a small, bowler hat. It was, thought Seb, as if he had been drawn only in pencil, like this. Those eyes of his were narrow and sidled from side to side as if convinced that the artist that had drawn him might attempt a little colour, and he better not try it, Sonny Jim. No. The rower wasn't for colour, or ornament, or jewellery. No indeed. He carried only a black, leather briefcase with a gold, tumbler lock that was set to unlocked (on zero-zero-zero-zero) as though the rower knew no one would bother to steal the contents of the case. Too boring. Probably lists of numbers. The rower tied the rowing boat to a stalagmite, picked up his briefcase and stood beside Seb by the side of the lake, avoiding eye contact and staring out over the flames. He didn't seem to need a mask. Seb wasn't used to this. It was usually the other person wearing the gas mask, and staring nervously out through the eye-pieces. Seb tried not to look at the man directly. They waited. Seb concentrated on holding his bottom hole firmly shut, like the mouth of a displeased pensioner. Any escaping whiff-gas, now, would ignite on the top of the lava lake, and turn the entire cave into a flammable fart. The lava frothed in front of them. They waited. Waited. After awhile there was the rumbling sound from below the surface of the long lava lake. The rumbling sound was now louder. 'Stick your arm out,' said the black-suited rower, in an upper class accent that sounded like the queen if she was a man, and if he were annoyed. The voice penetrated Seb's gas mask, and echoed around inside his skull. 'Pardon?' said Seb. If the rower had not sounded posh, Seb would have said 'What?' or maybe even, 'Eh?' The man tutted. 'Put you arm in the air or the driver won't see we are waiting for the sub!' 'Do-do you mean bus?' asked Seb. The eye-glass of his gas mask misted as he spoke, and fogged up as the man's next shout made him blush. 'NO!' Seb stuck his hand out, palm down, as high over the lava lake as he could reach. Like a yo-yo, a submarine rose below his hand. Well, thought Seb, not quite like a yo-yo, in that is was the size of a sideways building, it was made of some kind of crystal, and it was... well... a submarine. The submarine caught and reflected and refracted the light from the lake. The sub's surface was flawless and mammoth and multifaceted. There was a crack and a drawbridge fell from the sub's top to the lake's edge. It hit the rocky bank of the underground lake, denting the door not at all, but leaving a thin fissure in the rock. Hardest substance in the world, Seb thought. Must be made of diamond. The man from the rowing boat walked across the ramp, up to and along the crest of the submarine, to a porthole at its top. Humming loudly to himself, he went down what must, from the shape of his body, have been a ladder. After he had disappeared, Seb looked left and right. There was nothing else, only fire. Seb walked to the submarine, up the ramp, and climbed down the ladder. At its bottom, there were white suits hanging beside the door, white but covered in flaky scales like the suits of astronauts with dandruff. Beside these were a clutch of gas masks. Seb removed his and placed it amongst them. Before Seb was row upon row of seats. Above him, the diamond submarine made a creaking", "label": 1}
{"text": "then cracking sound and the porthole down which he had climbed sealed itself, as though it were frosting over. The seats were covered in seatbelts and above them hung a metal beam on which what was a metal hat, hanging just over where he would be seated. Seb sat. The black suited rower was the only other passenger. He leant out as far into the aisle as he could, and shouted, \u2018SERVICE!\u2019 then, on hearing no reply, \u2018TYPICAL!\u2019 He bent to his briefcase, unclicked it, took out a newspaper, and, unfolding it, began to read. Seb could see 'Notices', 'Advertisements' and long lists of numbers. Seb wasn\u2019t sure who the man was shouting at. The hat above Seb's head smelt, if he were honest, vaguely of vomit. There was a creeping, splintering sound, like that of hundreds of cockroachy feet, and the crystal-white walls of the submarine darkened above him in lines. A crack resounded, and a square of ceiling unsealed itself and hinged downward, revealing a T.V. screen. The screen turned itself on. The was a low thrum, like a thousand computers loading and the submarine began to move. Slowly, the colour of the walls went from diamond to ruby. It took seven minutes of screaming before Seb was sick into the bucket. He pressed his bottom cheeks together to stopper any shocked farts. The last thing he wanted was to foo his pants. the grimoire of farts The Dreaded Foo Appearance: Horrible\u2026 If it\u2019s somewhere between a Fart and a Poo; it\u2019s a foo you\u2019re looking at. I would stop looking. Smell: Like somebody has just melted your favourite toy\u2026 if your favourite toy is your nose... Preparation: You don\u2019t prepare for The Dreaded Foo; you spend the rest of your life trying to get over it. Execution: The Dreaded Foo is the death of my superpower. A leech of poo let loose in a marsh of fart. The slug of bottom matter sits in the seat of my pants and throbs like an evil crystal that steals all my power, leaving me weak and drained. Like that time in church when I was five. I become dizzy and sink to the floor and the school bullies make up poems about how I\u2019m a ginger stinker for the rest of my school days. I was only five! And I really hate poetry.

{"text": "baby was hovering, The baby had a shock of red hair. Shocked, thought the Major, by the stink coming out of the other end of its body. The baby bobbed outside the bay windows above the begonia bushes that grew there. The bush grew before a short wall, beyond which the curve of the street rose to become a hill. Major Private lived at the bottom of the hill, in the bottom floor flat and was surrounded by the smell of a bottom. \u2018What is that?\u2019 There was no reply. If the Major was talking to something, it was not apparent what. \u2018Oh my God, what is it?\u2019 he repeated. It didn\u2019t smell, it didn\u2019t even stink. It, if anything, stenched, and even through the closed window. Still, Major Private had been in the war, you know, and wasn\u2019t about the be put off, even by a smell that smelt like a large poo had grown its own bottom and was farting out of it. The Major opened the window. In - on one of its own farts - floated the naked baby. On the baby\u2019s naked buttock cheek was a post it note, flapping urgently in the passing wind. Holding his breath and using his battle-honed combat skills, the Major jabbed a knife-edged hand out and plucked the note right off its skin. It read, \u2018Your Godson. Parents gone. Look after him. \u2026 Please.\u2019 His Godson farted again and rose gently into the air of the lounge. He was asleep, his baby face calm and peaceful and innocent. The Major made the mistake of breathing a sigh of relief. The Major clutched his nose, his face, then his throat. \u2018Oh, what is that burning sensation on my face? Oh, why can I taste it?\u2019 If the Major hadn't have been choking, it would have been a scream. The Major collapsed on the floor. In front of his bulging eyes, the baby's fart fizzled out, lowering his Godson gracefully onto the floor, where he began to snore. \u2026 and, a year later, as the farts matured within my growing, rounding baby-belly, my nappy-routine would require a changing bag that came with a gas-mask and a power-drill\u2026. Sebastian stared straight ahead. \u2018It\u2019s the light isn\u2019t it, old boy?\u2019 said Major Private to the one-year-old, gesturing to the painting. \u2018Beautiful, what? Peace before the storm of War and all, eh?\u2019 Sebastian groaned as he seemed to focus. \u2018Grizzle,\u2019 he said, green eyes shying. Major Private bent down, peering inside the buggy. The Major realised Sebastian wasn\u2019t trying to focus. \u2018Oh no!\u2019 he shouted into the hushed Art Gallery. Suddenly, it felt like the cracked eyes in the old portraits had turned to stare at him. \u2018Oh no!\u2019 he whispered this time, his tone of horror exactly the same. \u2018\u2026 not the fart face.\u2019 Major Private ran, rushing the baby-buggy to the lifts. There were baby-changing rooms on every level of the Art Gallery, but only one that wasn\u2019t in a Ladies Toilet. That one was upstairs. Major Private jabbed the lift button with a sweaty finger. He glanced at the baby as he might glance at an unexploded grenade, before staring straight ahead and running like the wind. Wind, he thought, and shivered. He jabbed at the lift. Jab, jab, jab. Finally, the lift doors opened with a Ping! A group of women appeared, several pushing their own buggies. The Major said, \u2018After you, after you\u2019. Without looking at the Major, they said \u2018thank you, thank you\u2019. The lift was full. The lift doors closed - with its Ping! - just as the Major whispered: \u2018Thanks a\u2026\u2019 Ping! \u2018\u2026 lot.\u2019 He wheeled the buggy to the stairs. He lifted the buggy onto his back, like a rucksack. He ran up the stairs to the changing room, the lift rising next to him. Wheezing, he beat it to the top. He saw the changing room was free just as the lift arrived behind him. He went in. He locked the changing room door behind him and in front of the arriving women. He fiddled with the buggy\u2019s clasps. He unstrapped Seb, and one handedly threw open changing table. He pinned the baby on to the table. Strapped the baby down. Seb wriggled out. With one hand, the Major pinned the baby down again and got (from a poppy-covered changing bag that made the Major think of the countless, nameless dead of the War) a nappy, a thin, plastic nappy-bag, wipes, and a gas-mask. The baby was straining. Major Private screamed in terror, and threw on the gas mask just as the baby farted. He was blown back against the changing room wall, snapping off a clothing hook, then cracking several tiles. One tile fell and shattered on the floor. The baby, now alone on a cliff-edge of plastic, teetered above the fall from the changing table. The Major crawled through green bottom-fog to below the baby just as Seb fell. He caught the child, raising him back up. Rising himself, he unbuttoned the baby-onesie as he did so, flipped open the nappy, wiped the baby\u2019s bottom, dropped the now-brown wipes into the old nappy (which sat curled open like the poo that filled it, but white and frilly-edged), closed and bagged the old nappy, pulled a drill out of the changing bag, drilled, replaced the clothing hook, pulled a grouting-gun out, grouted. The Major put the baby on the floor, keeping him away from the broken tile with his booted foot, then picked up the tile\u2019s fragments, jigsaw-ing them into the grouted hole. As the Major flapped his forearm over the eye-pieces of the gas-mask (trying futilely to wipe the sweat out of his stinging eyes) Sebastian pulled the red, emergency chord that hung in the corner of the changing room. An alarm sounded. Red lights flashed. Major Private screamed. The Major grabbed the baby up, buttoned the baby\u2019s onesie, packed the changing bag, strapped the baby back in the buggy and left", "label": 1}

{"text": "quickly, just before the staff arrived. \u2018Somebody screamed in there,\u2019 he said to the first staff member. His voice sounded muffled, and he realised this was because he was still wearing the gas-mask. He kept going, regardless, and as he passed the now-queuing women from the lift, he said - the eyelids around his red eyes sweatily twitching - \u2018I\u2019d leave it a minute, if I were you\u2026\u2019 \u2026 Baby group sing-alongs were all about the timing\u2026 \u2026 the first public events I could remember were filled with the funk of embarrassment\u2026 and screaming\u2026 Sebastian\u2019s first time in church he would remember for the rest of his life. It was the first time he realised how powerful his farts could be. \u2026 As the smallest child, he was sat at the front, right next to the organist\u2026 \u2026 and my birthday parties, as my farts and I grew years older, required their own, specialised party hats\u2026 \u2026 by the age of 8 I could have a playground all to myself\u2026 \u2026 it was then that my bottom, and I, came into our own\u2026 \u2018Aw, that\u2019s yuk,\u2019 said Victoria. Richard chortled. Benedict said, \u2018Aww, did you fart?\u2019 Benedict always realised things last. They \u2013 Victoria, Richard, and Benedict- were sat at the back of the coach, in the middle seats. They didn\u2019t let anybody sit in the seats by the windows. Not even the Teaching Assistant. They were thick as thieves, thought Sebastian. Especially Benedict, he was really stupid. \u2018Here\u2019s mine,\u2019 laughed Victoria. She twisted her bottom forward, lifting herself up in the pose of somebody who had realised they were sitting on a bug. Phhhaeeeeert, went her bottom. \u2018Urrrgggh,\u2019 said a girl in the seats in front of them. \u2018That\u2019s disgusting.\u2019 Benedict went next, his fart taking a good minute to winkle out, like he was trying to scoop a single, small chocolate-chip out of caramel ice cream. It squeaked when it came, and Benedict jumped, perhaps forgetting- by then- that he was waiting for it. It stank worse than the other two. \u2018Dares the ginger stinker to fart!\u2019 shouted Richard up the middle of coach. Seb had been waiting for this. \u2018Ginger stinker, ginger stinker,\u2019 said Victoria and Benedict. Benedict, of course, was the echo. \u2018Dares you to stinker, ginger.\u2019 Hamza looked at Seb. They were sat next to each other on the journey to the Bio Mass Centre with Tricksy Pork Primary School. Hamza was Seb\u2019s best friend. He never talked about what had happened in church. Seb had let Hamza have the window seat. Richard farted again. \u2018Stop it!\u2019 said the girl in front of him, then, \u2018Miss, miss! Richard keeps farting.\u2019 \u2018Ginger stinker,\u2019 shouted Benedict suddenly, as if forgetting if he\u2019d said it last time, when he was meant to. \u2018Dares you!!!\u2019 Seb shook his head, bent over and retrieved two things from his rucksack. They were: His lunch, and A gas mask. He put the first on his lap and passed the latter to Hamza. \u2018For me?\u2019 asked Hamza. Seb nodded. Hamza put it on. Seb farted. The girl in the seats in front of Richard began to scream. Richard stopped farting, put his hands over his nose, then over his mouth, then tried to cover his watering eyes. Victoria swooned. As yet, Benedict hadn\u2019t reacted. Richard suddenly vomited into \u2013 and through- his fingers. His puke looked weirdly white, like he had been scooping up porridge made with too much milk. Benedict screamed. Higher-pitched than the girls. The Teaching Assistant stood up with a bin-bag and a pack of wet-wipes. She was ready for this. As she rose, she shouted, \u2018We\u2019ve got a puker!\u2019 up the central aisle of the coach, and, in formation, a teacher and another teaching assistant rose, also with bin-bags and cleaning cloths. They all rose into Sebastian\u2019s farts, which had drifted, slightly pea green, into the air of the coach, and clouded just below the roof. \u2018Puker,\u2019 one teacher said. \u2018Confirmed,\u2019 replied the other. As they spoke to each other they realised they had opened their mouths into stink and they bent double. One vomited straight away - the Teaching Assistant. A nearby child lost their breakfast, Seb didn\u2019t see who as he wasn\u2019t looking. He had started to eat the sandwich in his lunch-box (baked beans in pulped Brussel Sprout). The vomiting then went, like wet dominoes falling, forward along the coach toward its driver. Puke\u2026 Vomit\u2026 Puke. The teaching staff tried, as they themselves vomited, to crawl from child to child and clean them up. Often, all they did was add to the mess by puking on the child, too. All along the coach, there was a lot of screaming, and a lot of screams cut short by vomit. A baked bean fell into Seb\u2019s lap. He wrinkled his nose and scrubbed the red stain off his trousers. That could have been embarrassing, he thought. Next to him, Hamza breathed like Darth Vader. After he had finished his sandwich, and as the coach skidded to a stop in the Bio Mass Centre\u2019s car park - the driver rushing out to gulp down huge mouthfuls of air - Seb turned to Hamza. \u2018I have a secret to tell you,\u2019 he said to his best friend. \u2018A secret I\u2019ve never told anybody. You know that time in church. I have a secret power\u2026 well, my bottom does\u2026\u2019 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Sebastian didn't fidget. By habit, Sebastian stayed as still as a glass over a trapped spider. As with a glass over a spider, he moved backward and forward and side to side but was very careful not to tilt, or to lean, or to rise and let the spider out. It wasn't a spider that Sebastian was scared of; it was the farts in his bottom. He had been building them up for several hours and he knew, if he leaned over onto one buttock or another, the farts would come scuttling out. Instead, he kept", "label": 1}

{"text": "both of his buttocks firmly pressed to his chair, and the bottom burps (*please see Glossary) inside bubbled about and whirled around his bottom-hole. But they didn't escape. In this way, Sebastian prepared his gas weapon; the fart that would knock out his entire class for one, whole lesson. He had been gathering his farts, in between his butt cheeks, all morning, especially for Lesson Three. The Spelling Test. He had begun with breakfast. A Breakfast for the Best Farts Today, Sebastian's pants were made out of metal. With the cotton-shredding strength of his farts, they had to be. It was Superhero Day at Tricksy Pork Primary School. Sebastian ('Seb' to his friends, 'Why you \u2026' to his teachers, and \u2018Poo in his Pants\u2019, or 'Soggy Bottom' to his enemy, Richard) was wearing a Metal Man costume. The head of his Metal Man costume was made out of plastic, the body of his Metal Man costume was made out of fabric, but the bottom of his Metal Man costume was made out of iron. All the better for keeping the stink in. He sat next his friend Hamza, who was painted green and dressed as the Big Green Monster Hero, complete with clothes that had been ripped by his huge, green, polystyrene muscles. \u2018Shhhh,\u2019 said Hamza. \u2018She\u2019s talking.\u2019 \u2018Alright,' said Seb. \u2018Keep your shirt on.\u2019 Miss Pellen was staring at him. Sebastian was freckle faced with a wild frond of red hair, the vibrant deep red of poisonous frogs, or of viper\u2019s tongues, or warning lights that flash and say \u2018WARNING WARNING WARNING!!!!\u2019 Miss Pellen's eyes held their own warning. Because of Sebastian's Metal Man mask, Miss Pellen couldn\u2019t see his face, or his hair, but she could hear his mouth, or what was coming out of it. She stared and sighed. There was -as often there was- a bogie in the end of her nostril, which flapped on her sigh like a sail in the wind. Apart from breathing, the teacher had the looks and temper of an ogre\u2019s ghost. Sebastian gulped. Sebastian shushed. \u2018As I was saying,\u2019 said Miss Pellen. \u2018Today we will have a very special visitor, so I want you all to be on your best behaviour.\u2019 It was never, thought Seb, a completely average, boring visitor. And she never wanted the class to be a bit badly behaved, like they were every, other day. \u2018He is a School Inspector, but I don\u2019t want you to be worried, he\u2019s going to be watching me, not you.\u2019 The teacher looked worried. She looked, also, like she was tired, like she could do with a good sleep. If she knew what was brewing in Seb\u2019s iron pants, she would have been looking forward to the third lesson. 'He should be here during lesson three, during the spelling test,\u2019 continued the teacher, 'so I hope you all...' Here, she looked at Sebastian. '...have learnt the words I gave you.' \u2018I hate spelling tests,\u2019 growled Hamza under his breath. \u2018Big Green Monster Hero angry,\u2019 whispered Seb, in reply. Hamza giggled. \u2018WHAT WAS THAT?\u2019 said Miss Pellen. She was breathing heavily and turning increasingly pale, except for the end of her nostril, which was flapping green/black/green. \u2018Big Green Monster angry..?\u2019 The class held their breath. Miss Pellen breathed. Miss Pellen blinked. \u2018What did I say?\u2019 asked the teacher. She answered herself. 'Best behaviour.\u2019 She nodded approvingly as though her answer were exactly correct. \u2018That\u2019s right,' she confirmed. 'Best behaviour, especially in lesson three.\u2019 The spelling test. Seb also hated spelling tests. The teacher would put crosses beside his incorrect spellings and write \u2018No Sebastian! That\u2019s wrong\u2026 Misspelling, again!\u2019 next to each, which confused Sebastian. He would have thought Miss Pellen could spell her own name. Seb farted into his pants. He couldn't help it. His bottom was bubbling over. The rear pop (*see Glossary) made a tinny, clanging sound, like hitting a metal drum with a tea-spoon. Hamza turned to look at Sebastian in disgust. Hamza looked a little green. Inside his plastic Metal Man mask, Seb smiled; his plans were brewing, and \u2013 in his pants- they were coming to a fruity kind of fruition. He was ready to blow. In the end, it would all have gone well, if it hadn\u2019t been for Richard. Breaktime Squirt. It was difficult to pee without farting. Hard to open your bladder but keep your butt firmly shut when farts had been building up all morning, building to a head between your bottom cheeks. So it was for Seb. He bit his lip, scrunched up his right eye until he was winking at the cistern above the toilet, made an 'o' with his lips like he was trying to eat an orange whole, and tried to close his bum while letting out little dribbles of wee, one careful dribble at a time. It worked. Squirt. It had to. Squirt. It was either wee or fart but not both. He couldn't fart outside his iron pants because the stink from his bottom gas would have sent anybody who walked into the toilets to sleep. He couldn't fart into his iron pants (which he had lowered until they landed with a clunk on the toilet floor and now circled his ankles like leg-irons). If he had, he was sure to pee and then his iron pants would have sloshed when he walked and, later, begun to rust. So it was this; the only way: scrunching and gaping and squinting and winking at the cistern. And squirting. He couldn't even sit down as, as anybody knows, the seated position only cracks open the bum-tunnel and would have let his poot toot (*Glossary) whistle out; with the jaunty whistling sound of seven dwarves leaving their mine. As he peed, Sebastian listed these: 1) Smelly, 2) Whiffy, 3) Stinky, 4) Stenchy, 5) Wetly, 6) Silent-but-deadly-ly, and 7) Oh my God you need to see a Doc.

{"text": "the BANG! of the main toilet doors opening. A long squirt rushed out and very nearly a squeaking, fast moving mouse of a fart. Sebastian gritted his teeth and turned on his toes and looked at the lock on the inside of the cubicle door. His little box of toilet was still locked. He would have breathed easier, if he hadn't then recognised the voices of the three people who had entered the boys' toilets. He would have relaxed, even, if it had been three boys who had entered the boys' toilets. But one voice was that of a girl, and where Victoria went, so did Richard and- a few, scurrying seconds later - Benedict. 'Ginger stinker?' Seb felt the sinking feeling of recognising what they were chanting. 'Ginger stinker,' they sang. 'Ginger stinker. Where are you ginger stinker?' Seb flushed as red with anger as the ginger in their singing. The farts in his bottom rumbled ominously. They were \u2013 Victoria, Richard, and Benedict- all of them cruel-faced, nasty-eyed and annoying, but Richard was the smallest of the three and for some reason that meant he was more. More cruel, more nasty, and moreover the most annoying. His high pitched, churchyard-wind voice whistled around his wonky gravestone teeth and the sound of it left Seb feeling the chill of a cold rage. Meanwhile, Seb's wind was pressing up against his bottom like a balloon trying desperately to reach the sky. The three bullies were pushing open each of the other cubicle doors, which swung with the same high pitched creak as Richard's singing. They must have looked for him on the playground, as they often did, and realised he was in here, and were now bang-bang-banging on his door to the rhythm of their rudeness. \u2018Poo pants farts in Class, Poo pants farts in Church, The wind from his bum, Makes old men scream.\u2019 This, like the bullies, was annoying for three reasons: 1) It didn\u2019t rhyme. 2) It was true, but from four years ago. 3) And, most importantly, they meant it to be annoying. Which only made it more so, because it was. Annoying, that is. Why did bullies never forget the embarrassing things? He had been five years old, a time before he could control the power of his bottom. Back then, his arse couldn't knock out a class for an hour (as he planned for the spelling test), but even when he was in nappies, his Godfather wore a gas mask while changing him. That day was his first in church and he was sat with the smallest school-children, sat at the front; right beside Mr Mulwary. Mr Mulwary was playing the church organ. Mr Mulwary; the old man with the scream. \u2018Poo pants farts in Class, Poo pants farts in Church, The wind from his bum, Makes old men scream.\u2019 \u2018Why won\u2019t you shut up about that?\u2019 snarled Seb. The three laughed. \u2018He's ginger, He\u2019s a stinker,\u2019 they sang, Benedict always one word behind the other bullies. It didn\u2019t help when it rhymed. '\u2026 stinker,' finished Benedict. Seb flipped open the lock on the cubicle door. The door swung ajar, revealing Richard and Victoria and then \u2013 further back- Benedict, all leaning in, mouths aghast but laughing, the same shape and leer as the mouths of Pumpkins at Halloween. If there was something wrong about a girl being in the boys' toilet, there was something wronger about Victoria's face (with her long, sharp nose and wide cheeks and round body, like somebody had pinched her nostrils together, pulled hard, then blown air through her mouth so that the rest of her inflated), but the wrongest thing of all was the smell brewing in Seb's bottom. Seb bent over in front of them until his bottom-hole was in the air, and farted. Several farts shot out quick and small and green. Seb called this sort of fart; The Goblin. These Goblins scattered across the cubicle walls, leaving powder puffs of green and skid marks of rot. Some fluffed out of existence on the ceiling, but three scurried right into the fleshy, pumpkin-mouths of the bullies. They - all three of the bullies- were blown backwards against the toilet sinks. Clunk. They flapped to the floor. Slap. Slap. Slap. The sound of fish landing on a concrete quay. They flapped once, their arms, then their legs, then their fingers and finally, unseen, their toes. Seb had seen the effect of The Goblin before, and knew their internal organs would be doing the same flap-flip-flop. The Goblin was stunning. Richard, Benedict and Victoria were unconscious. Whistling, Seb pulled his iron pants carefully back up, slowly slid open the hatch that would let his farts into the pant's storage unit, then walked to the bullies, leant over them, and said, \u2018I\u2019m not a ginger. I\u2019m the ginger.\u2019 He washed his hands. He dried them on Richard\u2019s shirt, and walked out of the boys' toilets. On the way out of the door, the biggest year six boys were about to come in. \u2018Wouldn\u2019t go in there,\u2019 said Seb. They glowered at him. \u2018Richard just farted,\u2019 added Seb. \u2018And boy: was it a whopper\u2026\u2019 As he walked away, he heard the creak of the toilet door opening, then the screeching of one of the year sixes, and the sound of another screaming, 'Oh My God; the air is green!' And then, higher-pitched, 'Oh my God; there's a girl in here!' Line-up Time 'Line up time!' Seb moved. His leg tickled through his Lycra, and he gently brushed off an ant that had been clambering there. Seb stared down. He'd been sitting on an ant's nest. That hadn't been a pain in his bum, though. No, there wasn't a pain in his bum \u2013 no farts straining to get out like children at the lunch bell. That was what pained Sebastian. He stared morosely down the biggest, craggiest hole of the ant's nest. He'd have to take the spelling test because", "label": 1}

{"text": "he'd used up all of his extra farts on the bullies' faces. Still staring, Seb wondered if there was an ant, right at the bottom of its nest, staring down another, smaller crack; an ant wondering where it all ended. Seb felt the same way about school. 'LINE UP TIME!' There were farts stored, roiling and swirling, in his metal pants, but Sebastian knew they wouldn\u2019t be enough to knock out the class for a whole hour. Half that time, maybe, but no more. If I had a bad belly, I could make more farts, he thought. If only I'd eaten more beans. \u2018You okay?\u2019 Seb looked up. It was Hamza. \u2018Don't have a bad stomach,\u2019 said Seb. 'Want a bad stomach,' he added longingly. Hamza frowned. \u2018Oh, you wanna get out of spellings,' he said, after a moment. Seb nodded miserably. 'I go cross and couldn't stop myself... Let off some green ones.' Hamza nodded quickly, as if he'd seen a cross Sebastain many times before. He said, '... We should line up before that bit of bogie flies out of her nose.\u2019 'LINE UP TIME!!!' Miss Pellen was going white with rage, except at the end of one nostril, which had the look of a tiny green flag, like that an army ant might wave. An angry army ant. The more she raged the more it waved. Seb nodded. Tried to fart one more time, but managed only a half-hearted wheeze. His pants didn't even jolt. Hamza didn\u2019t seem to notice. He was staring beyond Seb at the fence behind him. If anything, he looked more green, as though Big Green Monster Hero was the one who felt sick. Seb turned. At the high, spike-topped fence posts stood a hooded man. The figure reached through the fence posts toward Seb and Hamza, and said, \u2018I love the sun.\u2019 His skin didn\u2019t seem to agree with him. Where it poked out from his dirtied, grey robes, it was blistered and red and raw, and mouldy blue in the places it bubbled up. Like baked beans that had long past their sell by date and were then microwaved beyond the cooking instructions. \u2018Love the sun.\u2019 \u2018Sack of drunken monkeys,\u2019 said Seb. 'Noooo,' said Hamza, blowing out his lips and shaking his head. 'Water bottle of electric eels. At least.' Seb nodded. Crazy, they had long since decided, came in five levels of strange animals in different containers. Each item on the list began with the unsaid words, 'Mad as a...' and were as follows; The Five Levels of Crazy \u201cAs mad as a\u2026\u201d Level 1 \u201c\u2026 cardboard box of\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026 tortoises.\u201d (Not mad at all.) Level 2 \u201c\u2026 backpack of\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026 relaxed hamsters.\u201d (Strange, yes, but harmless.) Level 3 \u201c\u2026 sack of\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026 drunken monkeys.\u201d (Often completely crazy. Sometimes, they\u2019re just asleep.) Level 4 \u201c\u2026 waterbottle of\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026 electric eels.\u201d (Shockingly mad.) Level 5 \u201c\u2026 handbag of\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026 a dog.\u201d (Utterly unexplainable.) Sebastian walked with Hamza to the centre of the playground- far from the metal fence, and when they turned again, the figure had gone. They quickly forgot about him as Miss Pellen shouted, \u2018Quiet! Line up quietly!\u2019 And, \u2018How many times do I have to tell you? How many? You\u2019re not in Nursery anymore. Grow up! Just grow up!\u2019 The line was silent and straight but short. \u2018Where\u2019s Richard, Benedict and Victoria?\u2019 asked Miss Pellen. She looked toward the main building. As she did so, the boys and girl emerged, one behind the other, as though doing the conga but forgetting to hold onto each other. Groggily, stumbling, they snaked their way toward the end of the class-line. Benedict, in particular, looked as though he had gone Big Green Monster Hero green. Victoria\u2019s right eye was crossed and bulging, as though trying to reach the end of her long nose, and Richard didn\u2019t seem able to stand still in the line, staggering into the child in front who shouted, \u2018Miss! Miss! Richard\u2019s pushing me.\u2019 \u2018You boys! You boys! And... You! Girl!\u2019 Victoria fell on her bottom, got up, and poked a finger into her right eye, as though to stop it crossing. She yelped as she did so. The Spelling Test Miss Pellen walked to the end of the line. The bright sunlight seemed to pass entirely through her. After several minutes of shouting, during which the three bullies swayed on their respective spots, the class went into their classroom. \u2018Right , Nafeesa and Casandra,\u2019 said Miss Pellen. \u2018... hand out the spelling books, please.\u2019 The good girls, thought Seb. As they did so, Seb thought about his best friend, Hamza. He knew he would be as much knocked out as all the other children in the class- when he let loose the contents of his bottom - and Sebastian felt bad. I\u2019ll get the spellings and write them in his book, he thought. Just as Cassandra had finished and had sat down, Seb reached behind him and unhitched the back of his metal pants. There was a hissing sound but beyond this his fart-gas moved silently. Silent but deadly. Or, at least, silent but knock-out-edly. Seb put his had out to catch Hamza as his friend slumped against the desk. He lowered Hamza carefully against the brown, fake-wood top. Around Seb, there were the louder thumps of children collapsing, and then a Bang as Miss Pellen did the same, onto the teacher\u2019s desk. Thunk... thunk... thunk. That wasn\u2019t pupils collapsing, thought Seb. He looked up. Thunk. There was Richard, holding his nose and running around his desk and into the window. Each time he circled he hit the window pane with a hard thunking sound (Seb thought, Oh that's why it's called a pane) and reached out with his left arm but couldn\u2019t reach the window-latch. Going a funny shade of greeny red (like an embarrassed frog) he ran for the door, but he must have held his breath for too long, because he ran straight into", "label": 1}

{"text": "it, and collapsed back from it, flat on his back on the carpet. Oops, thought Seb, as Richard lay entirely still except for the blood running from his nose. Quickly, Seb rose and grabbed hold of his enemy. Grunting he carried him back to his chair, sat him in, and lay him on the desk, blood seeping onto the red cover of Richard\u2019s small spelling book. Seb rolled his eyes and reached into the boy\u2019s right pocket. He found a tissue sprinkled with the occasional boogie, and hurriedly stuffed it up Richard\u2019s nostril. It huffed back out on one of the boy's breaths. Seb took Richard's finger and stuffed the tissue back up there, the finger with it, pinning it in, stoppering the blood. Richard whimpered once, as his finger went in. \u2018That'll do,\u2019 Seb whispered. In the next seat, Richard\u2019s best friend, Benedict, sobbed in his sleep. Sebastian shook his head and looked at the clock. Five minutes gone, already. He looked from the clock to Miss Pellen\u2019s desk, and closed his pants, again. All the gas he had been carefully cultivating in his underwear was out now and floating around the classroom in a green cloud. The Goblin Horde, Seb called it, in his Grimoire of Farts. He had named his Grimoire of Farts after the Grimoire of Monsters Sebastian had once found (and many-times read) in Tricksy Pork Library. The Grimoire of Monsters had looked like this\u2026 the grimoire of Monsters Goblin \u2026 with quite a lot of that\u2026 M i n o t a u r \u2026 and some extra other\u2026 Hydra Seb knew that monsters were generally bad but he kind of liked them anyway, and despite all evidence of horns and fire-breath and evil souls, felt he would be happy spending some time in their company. Seb felt much the same way about his farts- who doesn't like the smell of their own farts, no matter how monstrous and green they really are? \u2013 and so had named his Grimoire after theirs. (It was either that or 'A Wikipedia of My Wicked Rear'). He kept the book at home, under his bed, which was in the bunker under the Bottom Floor flat where his Godfather lived. Seb sniffed the green air, delicately. Tasted it, even. A good, spicy one - he nodded slowly, approvingly - with undertones of... what was that, he wondered, daisy? Dandelion? Hibiscus? Yes, he was proud of his whiff. No, not as proud as a parent at their child's first piano recital, not brought to tears of pride, no, not quite. But the feeling filled chest with a warm glow of having made something worthwhile, something useful , and that was something, by any reckoning. Still- he shook himself from day-dreaming about his buttucky whiffs(*), and shook the small smile from his lips - the stench had only enough power, enough depth, to keep the class and Miss Pellen snoring for so long. Got to get her spelling book, thought Seb of Miss Pellen and of his plan. He would rush to her desk, get the book of Spelling, return to his desk, copy the list down on his piece of paper, copy that onto Hamza's piece of paper, put his arm over his own work, let the rest of the class wake up, and then go over each word in fresh ink to make it look like he was writing it out there and then. Hamza was stupid, thought Seb, he always made the right decisions, he never did the wrong thing (like Seb always did, or so he was told) but maybe he would this time, if Seb winked at him enough. Seb rose. Walked to Miss Pellen's desk. He passed Richard, who was face down on his spelling book. Amid the pea-green fog of Seb\u2019s Goblin Horde, Richard was runner bean green. He looked ill. There was only so much fart a face could take and, what with the Goblin at breaktime (and with the nose-bleed after break), Richard's blood looked like it had run as far as it could away from the stink in his nostrils. As far as it could with a finger in the way. Seb continued walking to Miss Pellen\u2019s desk. On it, rested Miss Pellen\u2019s spelling answers. On Miss Pellen\u2019s spelling answers rested Miss Pellen\u2019s head. Her head was snoring. In the green mist that had come from Sebastian\u2019s bottom, she looked less like an Ogre\u2019s ghost, and more like an Ogre. Don\u2019t wake the Ogre, thought Seb, as he bent and stared around her cheeks and tried to read spelling number three: \u2018murderous\u2019. Seb shook his head ruefully. 'I would have forgotten the 'o'...' he admitted to himself. As he did so, he started as he heard a voice. \u2018Sebastion?' It said. Nobody called him this, not teachers, not friends, not enemies. It felt strange to hear it. Stranger was the way in which it was said, in parts, as though it had more syllables than it did, like the speaker was trying to fit in another name, after the 'Seb', and in between the 'as' and the 'tion'. Sebastion turned, bottom pressing against Miss Pellen\u2019s desk. She snored loudly and if there were any butt trumps (Glossary) left inside Sebastian\u2019s bottom, he would have farted them then, in shock. Unfortunately, there wasn't. There was man in the classroom, tall and stick-thin with eyes that seemed to be on the wrong way round, that didn't run from left to right, like everyday eyes, but from top to down. On top of this, they were dark, and had- so far as Seb could see- no whites at all. Overall, the stranger's face seemed to be made up of several parts. Seb didn't know the word 'mandibles' but, had he, would have thought of it when looking at the stranger's cheeks. The man wore a starch-straight thick-black jacket and trousers so straight and dark the legs could have been every other line on", "label": 1}
{"text": "a pedestrian crossing. The shirt above them was white, and seemed to be painted on, just as thick as the black, with a thin black tie running down it\u2019s centre. The man walked toward him. 'Sebastian,\u2019 he repeated. 'I am the School Insector.\u2019 \u2018The School Inspector?\u2019 Seb managed to say. \u2018Insector,\u2019 repeated the man. Seb blinked. It sounded like a spelling mistake. 'And the Assist Ant Head,\u2019 the man added. Miss Pellen stirred in her sleep, slurred 'Why yoooouuu,' then went back to snoring. Seb ignored her. 'Why aren't you...' started Seb. His words failed. His gaze fell to the floor. 'Lying down asleep?\u2019 asked the Insector. 'Ants don't mind your stench, Sebastian. We talk to each other by smell. Stink is our thing.\u2019 Seb didn\u2019t look at the him, still, but now not because of embarrassment. The content of the Insector\u2019s words were confident, but he was not. There was something as off about the Insector as there was about his name. As with its spelling, it felt as if somebody was taking the \u2018p\u2019 and the Insector couldn\u2019t quite figure out whom. It put all of the man on edge, his fingers flicking and recoiling like the limbs of a dying wasp on a frying pan, his tongue flicking out to wet the bottom of his segmented lips, and his thorax gulping as if he could suck the wetness back in. Children could smell fear in an adult as sharks could blood in water, or wolves could little girls alone in the woods. Seb could- even over his own fart- and it worried him. The Insector took a chair, walked past the whiteboard, placed the chair beside Miss Pellen\u2019s desk, and sat. In all of this, the School Insector shook slightly, as did his voice as he said, \u2018Sebastion, I'm pleased to meet you. As part of looking around schools, the Insectors always meet with pupils and ask them some questions about how they feel about their learning, how comfortable they are in school. That kind of thing. Absolutely nothing to worry about. Would you like a seat?\u2019 Seb looked around the classroom of snoring, unconscious children, green mist swirling gently up to desk-height, and slowly shook his head. There were no free seats. \u2018I must admit, I\u2019d feel more comfortable if you sat down, Sebastion. It isn\u2019t right for you to have stand through this interview. Not right at all.\u2019 The School Insector rose, walked to Richard, pushed him brusquely off his chair and onto the floor (thunk! he went, not for the first time), and brought the now free chair over to Miss Pellen\u2019s desk. \u2018There, have a seat.\u2019 Seb sat. \u2018So. How long have you been at Tricksy Pork Primary School?\u2019 \u2018Um, since nursery.\u2019 Seb counted on his fingers. \u2018Seven years...\u2019 he said. '\u2026 and two months.' \u2018Do you feel comfortable here? By that, Sebastion, I mean; when you come in in the morning, do you worry about anything, or do you feel safe?\u2019 \u2018Um\u2026 safe.\u2019 \u2018Now, do you feel the school work is easy, or a little bit hard sometimes, of hard, or very hard.\u2019 Seb shrugged. \u2018Kinda easy,\u2019 he said. The School Insector smiled. The grin only seed to be happening in the bottom half of his face, the top half seemed to be sniffing, \u2018Does the school ever talk to you about what you\u2019re good at? Do the teachers ever ask you do extra work on things you are best at, better maybe than other children in your class.' Seb didn\u2019t feel like he was good at English, or Maths... or Topic. Seb said, 'Um, what kind of thing do you mean?\u2019 \u2018Your superpower,\u2019 said the School Inspector. 'Sorry?\u2019 said Seb. \u2018Your farting,' said the school inspector. Seb gulped. \u2018You know about that?' he whispered. The School Insector looked slowly around the classroom. Victoria giggled in her sleep. \u2018Um, yes.\u2019 The School Insector said. 'Bit hard to miss the green bottom-fog, wouldn't you say?' \u2018It\u2019s a bit embarrassing,\u2019 said Seb. \u2018I don\u2019t like to talk about it.\u2019 \u2018Oh,\u2019 said the Insector. 'Well, I don\u2019t want to make you feel uncomfortable.\u2019 At the back of the class, Hamza snorted, and rolled over and half-opened his eyes. Most of the green Goblin Horde had gone, now. Hamza blinked. \u2018Listen, take our school's card\u2019 said the School Insector. He handed Seb what looked like a library card. \u2018I don\u2019t give them to everybody, you know. Everybody is unique, but some are uniquer than the other, and you are among the uniqu-est\u2026 We're a school for superheroes and it\u2019s time to go to school.\u2019 Miss Pellen snorted halfway through a snore and opened her eyes. They were brown and looked \u2013 in her white face- like coals on a snowman. They stared. They glowered. They burnt into Seb. He frowned. It's time to go to school? he thought. The School Insector rose as Miss Pellen pulled her head up. Her hair stood up on the left of her head like it was the antennae of an ant. The School Insector shook her hand and said, \u2018Well, thank you for your class\u2019s time, Miss Pellen, I think I have everything I need.\u2019 Miss Pellen stared at her hand as if she wasn't aware she had one (let alone a choice of two) to shake it with and watched as the School Insector let go of her fingers, turned around and walked toward the door. He stopped at Seb's desk and stared down at Hamza's book. He flicked through the spellings and looked perplexed for a moment. Hamza woke fully and stared blearily up at him. The Insector smiled, said 'Very good. That's the right one,' and tapped the page of the book before walking out of the classroom door. Inside, Seb panicked for the first time. Right one? He hoped he'd copied them all down correctly. Hamza was always ten out of ten. The class was now fully awake, heads turning this way and that, eyes rolling", "label": 1}
{"text": "up and down. \u2018He talked to you?\u2019 Miss Pellen hissed the last word. \u2018Yes, Miss,' said Seb, who got up and returned to his seat at the back of the classroom next to Hamza. In his hand, he hid the card the School Insector had given him. Half way up the carpeted aisle in the centre of the class, Richard moaned and said, thickly, 'Why am I on the floor?\u2019 As the class turned to look at Richard, Seb turned the card in his hand so that he could see it. 'Why am I lying in blood?' Richard then shouted, 'Why am I picking my nose?!' The card read, [Tricksy pork library Reserved book for one week. Reserved For Sebastion. Title of Book, A Book For When Things get Weird on a Tuesday Morning. Subtitle of Book, (at 9.32 am).] That Evening\u2026 The ant landed on the card. Seb wafted it to shake off the insect. He didn\u2019t see where it fell. It \u2013 the card, not the ant - reminded Seb of the library book he hadn\u2019t taken back for weeks. At home, the book was always near him, nearly always open. Miss Pellen would have been shocked to learn how often he read, how often he was at the local library, when he wasn\u2019t at school. Seb wasn\u2019t sure if shock could turn Miss Pellen any whiter. He turned to the book. the grimoire of Monsters \u2018You\u2019re welcome,\u2019 said the Major, taking the napalm cannister off his back, and hefting it into the corner of their kitchen. Sebastian blew on his Steakburger to put out the fire and stared at the Major. The Major\u2019s peak of hair was missing. In its stead was a browny-black-crimson area of red raw skin and scorch marks. In the centre of the Major\u2019s burnt forehead was another flying ant, burnt into a crash site on the human skin. Sebastian could only guess that the Major must have pointed the canned flamethrower directly at his own face. He saw now that the Major didn\u2019t have any remaining eyelashes. A long curl of hair (the only follicle he had left) was a fuse on the top of his head, alight and burning, smouldering out smoke, hissing down toward the Major\u2019s scalp. \u2018Um,\u2019 said Sebastian, beginning to point. He was unsure which area to point at, and so the finger rose as if in an exclamation mark. \u2018Um\u2026 your hair is on fire.\u2019 \u2018Oh\u2026 where?\u2019 asked the Major, patting at the bald skin that was now his head. \u2018The hair.\u2019 The Major found the one remaining curl and huffed out its flame with the flat of his hand. \u2018Thanks.\u2019 He grinned. \u2018Lot of flying ants about,\u2019 Seb said, staring at the centre of the Major\u2019s forehead. \u2018Yes.\u2019 The grin was gone. The Major stared out of the kitchen window and into a storm. \u2018There\u2019s a war going on...\u2019 said Major. He was always off fighting his War. The Major stared into the mid-distance. '\u2026 And it's going on in our own backyard.' Lighting painted the flat\u2019s shared gardens white and red, and the thunder came not long after it. White and red? thought Sebastian. Major Pane saw his look of confusion and explained. 'Yip. A war. Bally armies and all. Own back yard, etc...' The explanation didn't help. He nodded but not in the direction of Sebastian, but slightly to the side, as though somebody were standing next to him. \u2018It\u2019s turning nasty, eh Antonia?\u2019 There was a small explosion and the gnome by the pond lost his face. There it was- red and cheery as he went about his fishing- then a blank, vacant expression as the cheeks and nose and eyes were blown off and the emptiness within was left exposed, open, and, soon, wetted by the rain. It must be hard, Seb couldn't help but think, to look for your face, once you'd lost it. The Major lent over and closed the blinds. 'They're getting closer,' he explained again. 'Best not to stand in a lit window when the bombs are falling. Blitz spirit and all, eh?' Seb blinked, wondered if he should reply, and thought better of it, picking up his library card, studying it, instead. \u2018Look,' said the Major. 'It\u2019s been a long day. I\u2019ll do the washing up.\u2019 He picked up the plates as he rose. \u2018Get some sleep. You\u2019ll need it. Early bus in the morning.\u2019 'Wish I could get a bike,' muttered Seb, The Major either ignored this or couldn't hear it through his bandaging and walked - whistling to himself - toward the kitchen sink, adding, \u2018Sleep tight, and don\u2019t let the bed bugs bite\u2026\u2019 he turned and, using Seb's steak-knife, made a cutting action across his throat. \u2018\u2026or kidnap you, or make you do things you don't want to do\u2026\u2019 \u2018Night\u2019 said Seb. Blinking, and not only from his weariness, he walked to the lounge, lifted up the rug in its centre, lifted up his trapdoor, and went downstairs to his bed, to read. the grimoire of farts The Goblin/Goblin Horde Appearance: fast-moving green mist. Preparation: all standard fart-inducing foods, but eaten in a cabbage or broccoli soup. Farting technique: bend over to shoot fart out of bottom.

Smell: like having a spiky stick shoved up and down your nostrils, if that stick had previously been used to clean a troll\u2019s toilet. Texture: that of swallowing a used, bogie filled tissue. Effectiveness: fast and numerous so not especially smelly, and not powerful enough to achieve lift off. Useful against multiple opponents, or against surprise attacks. Personal experience: for the farter, the green goblin is a satisfying sort of fart but short. It\u2019s the kind of fart that makes you say, \u2018Better out than in\u2019.

[Underlined three times in my text] Seymour watched as Jack Gittes yawned and turned to the farmer on his right. The farmer ignored Gittes, staring straight ahead at the man speaking on the dais. The speaker on the dais said, 'Remember we live next to an ocean but we also live on the edge of a desert...' He levered his forearms on each of the words, as though his swarthy, pallid, sausage-skin fingers were on the pump that would save the city from its drought. '' Los Angeles is a desert community'' He paused mid-pump and stared at his audience. Two benches ahead, an elderly human looked down and opened the comic page of his Post Record. The bench was across a space in the brown tiled floor and so all Seymour could see of the strip was the word 'welcome' in large bold font. The gap between Seymour and humanity was wider even than his considerable corpulence, further even than his radius of faint sweat and unmissable fish. The pew to either side of Seymour was empty, and the one behind. The speaker continued, 'Beneath this building, beneath our streets, is desert.' As he spoke, his moustache bristled stand-offishly and white, like the hairs of a cactus. 'I respectfully suggest that eight and one half million dollars is a fair price to keep the desert from our streets, and not on top of them.' Another functionary rose to the dais, brown from hair to trouser hem, deep, tanned lines a dried out delta from the corners of his eyes. 'I suppose,' he drawled into the plastic webbing of a microphone. 'We better hear from Water and Power first. Mr Mulwray.' The human and the microphone both stood under a large photograph of Roosevelt. FD' not T' R. Seymour was glad it was Freddie and not Teddy. The latter had a moustache just as angry as the previous speaker, and in photographs always wore the expression Seymour imagined a disappointed father would wear. Seymour didn't know his father from Adam (or, more likely; Cain) but was keenly aware of what disappointment looked like. Around Roosevelt was a dark wood frame and beyond this a ripple of green tiles, the deep algae-green of the sea off New England. Of home. Seymour stared at the colours of his childhood and his eyes began to water. They watered, however, almost all of the time, along with his sweat glands and the ill-formed gills hidden by the greasy hair that cascaded over what little ears he had. In other spots he was already bald and the pallid skin there looked like rocks washed white by shadowed waters. As Hollis Mulwray walked up the steps to the dais and placed several sheaves of paperwork on the large, mahogany desk there, two men unfurled a map on the board behind him. Seymour opened his Los Angeles Post Record and looked down. Hollis Mulwray. He was the human Seymour had come to watch but Mr Mulwray was also in the newspaper, at least; in name only. [Crossword boxes vertically, 2 down: Mulwray.] Seymour stared at the crossword. It had names written into the answer boxes. Seymour thought of it as the Word of Cross. This was where Seymour wrote the names of the humans Noah Cross desired dead. His cryptic hit list. Seymour wrote them down in black and white because he didn't want to make any mistakes. Not again. The clue to 2 down was 'Old water feature cracks, at cost' (7). A keen reader of The Puzzle Section, Seymour knew the answer to be 'Damages'. Instead, Seymour had written 'MULWRAY'. At the end of the boxes, written where it shouldn't be, was scribed an 'H'. Hollis Mulwray. In front of a map marked 'Proposed Alto Vallejo Dam and Reservoir' Hollis Mulwray, chief engineer of Water and Power, was saying, 'In case you have forgotten gentlemen five hundred lives were lost when the Van Der Lip dam gave way.' Hollis Mulwray himself looked like an old owl that had seen too much. Grey suit like faded plumage. Round, thick rimmed glasses. Unblinking eyes. Sunken, pallid cheeks and a gulping Adam's apple as if he'd recently been tricked into swallowing a whole hook, line and sinker. His throat bobbed as he spoke. 'Core samples have shown that beneath this bedrock is shale similar to the permeable shale in the Van Der Lip disaster.' Mulwray wore the style of the day; the style of High Sumer 1937; the style of Jack Gittes. Neck wear in red, contrasting to the greyness of the suit. But, whilst Gittes' tie was a wolf-in-lamb's-throat red, Mulwray sported a bow tie in coagulated crimson. A red so dull it co no longer be bothered even to run. 'It could not withstand that", "label": 1}
{"text": "said. 'A head hunter?' 'Well, yes' uh' I hunt all of them, really.' Carnegie laughed as though one of them had told a good joke. Seymour stared. Carnegie nodded his appreciation, as if the joke had been told by Seymour. Seymour gulped. 'Well...' Dale Carnegie scrawled. 'To the Hitter of Targets...', then said, '' if you stay for the second half, this attribution will be perfect for you, I promise.' Carnegie looked Seymour up and down as though searching for something positive and sincere to add. His forehead creased as an easy, instinctive action jittered and seemed - as a baseball hitter would have it - to catch the yips. 'You're... you're quite tall,' he said, then quickly wrote this and signed below it. 'Would you, ah, sign this too?' Seymour proffered a second copy of How to Win Friends and Influence People. He had a green as well as an orange (a second as well as first edition) as though covering both ends of the rot-spectrum. 'Sure,' said Carnegie. He signed but did not add a personalised inscription. Carnegie's kindness had been exhausted, it seemed. 'Thank you,' said Seymour. He couldn't remember when anybody had been so nice to him. As he left the table he looked at the door, then back to his seat, which, after several moments' consideration, he went back to, and sat upon. There would always be tomorrow to end August's life. Whilst he waited for Carnegie to finish signing, he withdrew his pen from beside his Smile. He opened a page at random. It fell on nine ways to get the most out of the book. He crossed out the last word of the first point and scrawled four stars at the end of the fourth. Later he would write in the time and the date and beside both add, 'This is the moment I knew who I wanted to be'. For the first time, it was a 'who' and not a what. 'How to Win Friends and Influence People,' was a book he could not only live by, he felt, but kill by too. He turned to the first chapter, picked a line halfway through and read, '' constantly reminding yourself how important these principles are to you. Picture to yourself how their mastery will aid you in leading a richer, fuller, happier and more fulfilling life. Say to yourself over and over: \"My popularity, my happiness and sense of worth depend to no small extent upon my skill in dealing with humans.'' Seymour said this. The woman in off-white didn't return to her seat and Seymour placed his increasing pile of texts ' two books and an annotated newspaper - on its cushion. Staring at it, he thought; I need to buy a valise. Jack Gittes looks at photographs of Noah Cross and Hollis Mulwray. The photographs are in a developing tray and submerged in developing solution. Gittes: This? Walsh: Well they got into a terrific argument outside the Pig and Whistle. Gittes: What about? Walsh: I don't know. The traffic was pretty bad. I heard one thing, though... apple-core. Gittes: Apple-core? Walsh: Yeah. 2 - The Big Secret Of Dealing With People Seymour read, as he had all night, whispering the words as his fingers traced them, as a five year old would if they were an excitable five year old. 'There is only one way under high heaven to get anybody to do anything. Did you ever stop to think of that? Yes, just one way. And that is by making the other person want to do it. Remember, there is no other way.' 'Well, whatch ya having?' Seymour closed How to Win Friends and Influence People. He looked at the valise he had bought; on the ground beside him, but did not return his book to it. As he looked at it, as he always did, he thought reflexively; a valise makes a man almost impossible to kill. Though he was both half man and half fish, and ' both paradoxically and unnaturally- more than three quarters demon, he hoped the aphorism also applied to him. 'Well..?' The barman. The barman smelt of sweat and smoking, as though, like many of the cars on the street, the heat had made him blow a gasket. He wasn't looking straight at Seymour, but over his shoulder at that street. 'You've worked here awhile,' Seymour said, mimicking Carnegie's accent, leaning into the r's as though he were starting the propeller of a rotary engine. 'I can tell.' He wiped his chin and a wet patch on the bar with his sleeve. Mid-western made him dribble, apparently. Or; dribble more. Now the barman looked at Seymour, his brow wrinkling it, forming a weary, cynical 'u' on his forehead. As in, not you again, thought Seymour. He had been here several times, watching the street, or watching the other side of the street, the alley, the entrance beside the Chinese laundry. No matter the shift, the barman had the look of somebody about to put a swear word in front of the 'u'. The barman said, leaning as heavily into the bar as he sighed into his words, 'Yeah, you've been in for several weeks.' Seymour nodded. 'Exactly.' If there was something fishy about Seymour's looks, then the barman could be described as meaty, not in the 'all humans are lambs to the slaughter' way of the Dagon, but in his solid limbs, his bovine expression (too slow to be porcine) his thick, textured skin. Indeed, all the patrons of the bar had the look of random mammals as much as men, and of all the places Seymour had been in (since Innsmouth) this Cocktail bar made him feel the least out of place. It was the kind of bar that looked like a photo of itself; black and white and shadows and shades. There wasn't local colour in here, all of the patrons, local or not, were dulled by use, dimmed, eyes dog-eared", "label": 1}
{"text": "at the edges where they turned down, faded. There was colour in the cocktails alone which perhaps explained why so many of the drinkers stared into them as though into sucked, trapped and bottled day dreams. 'And not,' Seymour continued 'because you have no choice, but because of the ease of your manners. You're like a fish to water here' it was Seymour's favourite analogy, 'this is your metier. I watched the flick of your hands as you swing the bottles in the air, the confidence of your catch.' There was a confidence in Seymour's voice, also, and not just the confidence of a con man. Yes, it was easier to pretend to be someone else when he felt surer in himself. But, somehow, How to Win Friends and Influence People and made him feel comfortable in somebody else's skin. Seymour paused, tilting his head toward the door. You couldn't see it from here, but the bar had 'COCKTAILS' written in neon blue outside, lit even in the day, as it was now. 'You're like a pro pitcher on the mound.' 'Listen, I haven't got'' All day, he was about to say. Seymour could have said, if anybody has time it's a barman in an establishment like this, but that would have been to Kick the Bee Hive, which was no way to Win Friends or to Influence Humans. 'Sure, sure, pal, but listen.' Seymour leaned in. Chummy, he believed the human expression was. 'You're a natural, and that's not flattery. It's sincerity. You know the difference in between the two?' 'Course I fuc'' 'Truth,' interrupted Seymour. 'The truth is you can take one look at me, and know the water I swim in. The perfect cocktail for me. That hooker at the booth at the back, the same. The Chinaman who walked past, the same.' His underarms and his palms were wetter than usual. It wasn't quite sweat, but slimier - more batrachian- and it left daubs on the bar just the same. Seymour wiped again. The barman didn't argue. The barman even glanced at Seymour, who tried to smile in reply (Chapter 3) but all of this felt so unnatural, and not the kind of unnatural that was Seymour's metier. 'You knew the moment I walked in the door the perfect cocktail for my tastes, for me, didn't you?' he said, instead. 'Because you know your job, inside and out. Isn't that the truth?' The barman nodded as he moved away, to the bottles, not pausing as he made the affirmation. He tossed one bottle ' an orange liquid - then another, and began Seymour's mix. Seymour looked at the clock on the wall. Its integers were on backwards, as if it had got dressed in a hurry, or ' more likely given the bar's setting in Chinatown - forced into a straight-jacket. Opening the back of the orange, first printing of 'How to Win Friends and Influence People', Seymour let the letters fall from the back pages. He kept them all there, now, all the correspondence with The Friends of Lovecraft, and August Derleth in particular. They were submissions to his fake literary publisher, Arkham (named after a town close to Seymour's home, and partly after what he thought humans tasted like) wrapped in a bundle twined in fishing line. He enjoyed the significance. They flapped slightly as they landed on the bar. The barman placed the drink on one of them, as though it were a coaster, creating a rim of wet. In this heat, even the glasses had to be chilled. In the bulb of glass, the drink was a lemony orange, growing darker from stem to lips, and was fronded by a rind of orange, its pores the darkest of all. 'Well, this is a fine drink made with no little skill.' He mentally checked himself. Yes; still the truth. 'You have judged me, my friend, expertly. What's it called?' 'Angel Face.' Seymour looked at him. In the mirror behind the bar, he caught a glimpse of his rubbery lips, over the edge of which drooped his pallid green cheeks, glimpsed the way his eyes looked like salt-water pools. The skin around them was the colour of grass and like grass around saltwater pools, the skin appeared to be rotting. Salt's bad for grass, he remembered, and I'm sore on the eyeball. Seymour did not linger on his features, as his target wouldn't, when he arrived. 'Spot on.' Seymour smiled. People do often see me when they die, Seymour thought. After the barman walked away, Seymour drank. Mostly - and despite the orange - he could taste blue; a dry-ice kick of sapphire gin. As he sipped, he selected letters from Derleth's correspondence. He scanned the penultimate paragraph of the last, written in his own hand; a reply. '' with great expectation of perusing the genius of your Friend, and meeting you at the COCKTAILS bar, Chinatown, Los Angeles.' Honestly, it's the truth, Seymour thought. I am looking forward to our meeting. That is a Smile in my pocket and, yes, I am pleased to see you. August breezed in. Like the night before, he ate an apple. Unlike the previous night, he is alone and without his valise. This left Seymour feeling relieved. He could be embarrassing turning up with the same accessories. August walked to the bar, squeezing in three stools along. 'Whatch ya having?' Around what remains of the apple, August ordered a cooled beer. 'Thirsty work today, eh?' said the barman, placing the glass. It was a question more than he had asked Seymour. His mark didn't answer, slurped and paid. The back of August's hand promised not only the taste of ham, but was its pinked colour. Skin unused to the Californian sun. His face carried the hue, and had a lot of space on which to do so, being wide and fresh as his grin. 'It ain't like this back home,' he said, his vowels as wide and", "label": 1}
{"text": "as easy as the face and the grin, his consonants chewed to the quick, as with the apple core, which he proffered. 'Not like back home,' he repeated. 'Got a bin for this?' The barkeep raised a wicker basket, saying, 'Where's home?' The apple core went in. 'Soak City.' 'Wisconsin?' 'Yep.' 'You won't get summers like this.' 'Nope.' Another apple was in Derleth's hand. The barkeep replaced the basket, then said, 'Hope you don't mind me saying, but you go through a lot of produce.' August smiled but it wasn't as wide as it had been, and not fresh. No, something had gone off back there, inside his head, Seymour thought. August gulped though he had not, in that moment, bitten. 'Well, I hope you don't mind me saying, but I'm something of a Christian. No, I know it's not so fashionable in these parts...' The barman smiled. 'Not in Chinatown,' he agreed. 'But I recently found out something... something bad, and ever since that, I feel like I know too much.' 'And of any fruit apples would be appropriate for that, eh, friend,' said the barman. Crunch. 'Yep.' Friend, thought Seymour, I wonder what that is like. August looked less interested - looked away - and the barman took this as his stage direction, wandering to the end of the bar to continue his polishing. 'August.' Seymour said. Derleth stared at Seymour and opened his mouth so that it hangs in much the same way as the latter's ' as high as it was wide ' but with less lip. 'You?' he asked. A pause. 'You're the editor?' 'Yes, and can I quickly say how privileged I feel to meet a writer of such remarkable writings. Such vivid, remarkable, accurate writings,' Seymour said. Like the looseness of his saliva, he found it easy to slip into the speech patterns of a literary man. A man, like those he held, of letters. It might have been the alcohol or it might have been the Smile in his pocket but Seymour was enjoying himself. Another pause. Seymour was not used to being the recipient of so much staring, and quickly said, 'Shall we retire with our drinks? Somewhere more comfortable.' Seymour was thinking of a booth and picked up his books, the letters, the valise (heavier these days) and his vivid drink. Derleth's stare fell to the last. 'Angel Face,' Seymour said. 'Apt, eh?' Tottering, he lead an unbalanced way, skirting two round, metal-hemmed tables before he noticed August hadn't followed his lead. Seymour smiled in what he hoped to be a reassuring way, and felt a little drool slip from his bottom lip. He returned a few steps, raising the book How to Win Friends and Influence People and spilling a little of his drink. 'Fascinating reading, this. It's a pity you couldn't attend more of the lecture. The next section is erudition, pure and simple.' Returning to August and putting down his cocktail, and valise, Seymour opened the book to a page he had starred and asterixed and pentagramed, to aid his memory. 'See,' Seymour's finger wiped the bottom of the line, back and forth as he read, 'What do you want? Sigmund Freud said that everything you and I do springs from two motives: the sex urge and the desire to be great.' 'Now,' Seymour placed a hand on his shoulder. Derleth flinched, but did not withdraw. 'I don't want to have sex with you,' Now; Derleth withdrew. '' but, with the acuity of your prophecies ' the illumination of your writing- I can fairly say; I can make you great.' 'It isn't me. It's a friend'' 'Ah, yes,' said Seymour. 'I remember from the letters.' August continued. 'It's an old friend. Lovecraft' who wrote... But he's dead... Died of cancer.' August, who had met Seymour' eye, looked away again. There was a memory there and not just the death itself. He told him, realised Seymour. About us. 'I guess,' continued Derleth. 'I'm the unofficial executor of his literary estate.' 'Well,' said Seymour. 'Arkham Press would be happy ' more than happy- to take ownership of all his works.' Which would be sincere - he added to himself - if Arkham Press existed. August nodded, almost to himself, but followed when Seymour again left the bar for the shadows at the back of its lounge. Seymour settled onto red leather in shadows dark enough to give it the shade of old blood. He placed the valise beside him and the paperwork on the table. There seemed, Seymour reckoned, to be blood everywhere these days. Almost as if it were a second coming. If he hadn't a mind for white walls, red wheelbarrows and disassociated news, he would have recalled Yeats or the Old Testament. Instead, he thought of the Pacific. Here and there, the leather was stained. Where he had touched him, Derleth's shoulder was daubed dark by what passed for Seymour's sweat, or what passed out of his sweat pores. It was as much slime as anything. August Derleth resisted the urge to wipe at it. Polite, thought Seymour; it'll be easy to be friends with him. 'You were there?' asked August, sitting opposite Seymour as the latter leaned over his letters. 'Hmmm?' Seymour asked. 'Last night?' Derleth nodded to the orange book. 'Sure,' said Seymour. 'Didn't you see me?' Frowning, August shook his head. There was a lost glaze to his gaze. Like a man out of his depths, but out of them in the way of being dizzyingly above them. His expression was vertiginous; close to falling. Therein, thought Seymour, was an innocence that stood on the edge of a terrible knowledge, like a lamb trying to translate the phrase 'to the slaughter'. Seymour returned to the letters, found the one addressed from August. As he perused, he eased the knife from his pocket. They won't notice another stain, he thought. Nor the corpse, that's just Chinatown. A discolouration in the wood on August's side", "label": 1}
{"text": "of the table marked it with a wide, unblinking, Cyclopean eye. Derleth covered it with his beer, didn't raise the glass again, and refused to glance down as if, if he were to do so, he would see it staring at him from the fermented depths. The letters recaptured Seymour's attention. He unfolded a story tightly packed within them, and read from the section of it he had marked with a pentagram; 'vista of dark and dripping stone,' he intoned, 'with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously in enigmatical sense-impacts uninscribable save as gibberish. The two sounds most frequently repeated are those rendered by the letters 'Cthulhu\" and 'R'lyeh\".' Derleth drank. 'Doesn't that feel so real?' said Seymour. 'As though it is brought to real, fleshy, pulpy life on the page.' 'It is real,' August whispered. He met Seymour's eye as little as that of the table. He had finished the apple core but Seymour was unsure of where it had gone. Seymour positioned the point of his Smile as Derleth whispered, pointing at the knee, then August's thigh, then his hip. He was trying for the femoral artery. Femoral artery, femoral, femoral, he thought, as he talked. 'It is a great shame a writer of real power, like this writer, should die so early of cancer of the femoral artery' he said, distractedly. August slid backward and straightened his abdomen, his hamstrings susurrating on the red leather as he did so. 'I mean, cancer of the small intestine.' Derleth's eyes widened and he looked off into mid-air, as though the last two words were popped balloons deflating across the cocktail lounge. Seymour deflated with them. 'How did you..?' August began, but finished mid-sentence as his gaze hung in mid-air. Seymour found it hard to live with silence, had done since that night outside the hotel room in Innsmouth, so said, 'I'm impressed you spotted that I shouldn't know how Howie died,' Seymour said. There was a further pause while August stared. 'You don't mind if I call him Howie?' Seymour asked. Seymour didn't know if it was the 'Howie' or the specific location of the tumour, but August rose and hurried to the door. It was definitely, thought Seymour, something I said. Seymour followed. Ran through the door, out under the sign lit neon even in the day, into a widening alleyway, then left, into a food supermarket. There was shouting and gesticulating ahead and Seymour ran down one aisle, and up the next, past the fresh produce, the veg, then the fruit. With the familiarity of a patron, August grabbed a Cox as he passed, and the box juddered and spurted its contents over the floor. Seymour slipped, turning his left ankle, and screamed as he rose. Just my luck, turning my ankle stepping on a Cox. He grasped at the joint, but still ran, a hunched, crippled run that gradually rose alongside the agony. He was across the street, past the engine housing of a white Buick Roadmaster, then open road, opposite pavement and BANG. A gun, he thought, instinctively, but no; it was the Buick, gaskets made rockets by the high heat. Limbs made thick and treacly by adrenaline, he reached the opposite pavement, dodged right around a Chinese laundry, down an alley perpendicular to the road, and left onto steps that led down. He hobbled in that direction. The laundry, now, was above Seymour, huffing and steaming like a whale at the surface, and Seymour deep down, deep as home. He descended into darkness, tentative on his left. His Smile was in his hand, tooth-sharp. Well, his teeth sharp. Seymour tightened his fingers, the flaps of webbing between them constricting on its handle. Seymour's eyes were quick at attuning to darkness, used to this kind of submarinal world. The steam from the laundry's flues drove past in spumes. August's door painted ' unhelpfully - black was ahead, unnumbered. It looked for all the world like the entrance to an underwater cave. Seymour thought of Grendel's mother, as he often did at night. She reminded him of his own. Thick drool laced his heavy set chest, greying his shirt, and Seymour's realised how hard he was breathing. To control the huffing of his lungs, Seymour flexed his gills. Little good that would do, oxygen-wise, thought Seymour, but it calms me, and I can smell a reassuring aroma, like rot or death or each leading to the other. Calmed, he reached out, opened the door. The stench was stronger, but August was nowhere to be seen. There were three beds, several half-packed bags, and more shadows then either. Seymour's Smile inched forward, with his bulk behind its length. He jolted as his Florsheim shoe bumped a shadow he should have seen. He gritted his sharkish teeth as the jolt caused him to lean on his left leg. He thought he heard his ankle bones gritting in turn. Shadows of Innsmouth. He recognised it in the quarter-light by the rotting watercolour scene on its cover. He felt a ripple of algae green shame passing over his skin (he flushes, as an ancient cistern does, green) and he stamped on the book vengefully as he stepped across it. There was a kitchenette in the corner, and, by the smell, a latrine beyond the drapes on the far wall. On the other side of the kitchenette was a door ajar. Seymour's passed through it and into the light of the alley beyond. August was gone. Seymour bent and lent against the door jamb without looking at it. With the width of his buttocks he could hardly miss. He wheezed then coughed into his hands. They felt wet, but perhaps only with their habitual if abnormal slime. He checked his palms for red and finding none there, wiped at his sweating forehead, heading off the droplets before they could reaching his bulging eyes. Staggering with one foot, hopping with the left, Seymour returned to the studio apartment, and drew open", "label": 1}
{"text": "the thick curtains above the kitchenette. They were matted by a texture he could not discern until light shone on them. Cat hair. Under it, on a crumb encrusted surface, a clock in the form of a porcelain feline waved its seconds at the room. Waving a paw on every second and pointing a paw at Seymour on those in between. Seymour walked to the dropped paper-back. Visible now around it were a scatter of papers ' some letters between the Friends, a great many rejection slips- and returned with them all to the kitchenette surface. 'Must have' been' what was in the' valise,' he wheezed to himself. He shook his head. No; now wasn't the time for valises- not again. After the last man with a bag, he had bought and painted his Smile. He could no longer own a gun; there was too high a chance that his failure would overwhelm him in the hours around four in the morning, and he would take the weapon and bring the darkness between the stars into the space between his ears. Besides, his Smile was one of the rare things made him smile, especially when he used it to succeed, to prove himself, to kill an enemy of the Dagon. As ever, as he opened the pages of Shadows over Innsmouth, he flushed with a fresh wave of rot-green guilt. He turned to the page he had read until the reading was as much from memory, and began to read. 'Without the least shadow of a doubt, the lock in my hall door was being tried ' cautiously, furtively, tentatively'' Seymour's fingers palsied, remembering the cool prod of the metal key they had held, all those years ago, the webbing between them twitching taut then loose then taut. The skin around is protruding eyeballs felt hot, as though his eyes would rather somewhere else entirely, and were working their way free. He wondered if this was how the humans in the news articles felt; exposed but unable to stop themselves. He continued reading. '' It never occurred to me that the fumbling'' Here, Seymour snorted. 'Fumbling?' he hissed, angry despite himself or, more specifically, despite his lack of self. 'Fumbling? Did it occur to you, Lovecraft, that the lock was rusty like everything else in my home town? Huh?' He went on. '' Then the lock of the connecting door to my room was softly tried. The bolt held, of course, and I heard the floor creak as the prowler left the room.' 'He's calling me fat isn't he?' asked Seymour, of the clock-cat. The clock took a second to think about this, then pointed at Seymour's belly. 'Stop it!' hissed Seymour. The cat pointed again. 'Stop!' Again. 'It!' He read, 'After a moment there came another soft rattling, and I knew that the room to the south of me was being entered. Again a furtive trying of a bolted connecting door, and again a receding creaking. This time the creaking went along the hall and down the stairs, so I knew that the prowler had realised the bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a greater or lesser time, as the future would shew. The readiness with which I fell into a plan of action proves that I must have been subconsciously fearing some menace and considering possible avenues of escape for hours. From the first I felt that the unseen fumbler...' 'Honestly,' said Seymour, staring at the hand that pinned open the page. The fingers were no longer shaking. The palsy had moved to his heart. His teeth, even, felt as though they vibrated in their housings. 'I think I've got delicate fingers. Artistic even!' Finesse did help when gutting a human. More Lovecraft: '...meant a danger not to be met or dealt with, but only to be fled from as precipitately as possible. The one thing to do was to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as I could, and through some channel other than the front stairs and lobby...' 'Blah, blah...' said Seymour, teeth not so much gritting as jig-sawing together. It went on, so Seymour had to. 'I was irresolutely speculating on when I had better attack the northward door, and on how I could least audibly manage it, when I noticed that the vague noises underfoot had given place to a fresh and heavier creaking of the stairs.' 'Again!' hissed Seymour. He had forgotten how often Lovecraft had called him fat. 'Bastard.' The cat was wearing a small, grim, grin, not Cheshire so much as Yorkshire. 'Cunt,' he added, to the cat. He returned to the novella. 'A wavering flicker of light shewed through my transom, and the boards of the corridor began to groan with a ponderous load. Muffled sounds of possible vocal origin approached, and at length a firm knock came at my outer door. For a moment I simply held my breath and waited. Eternities seemed to elapse, and the nauseous fishy odour of my environment seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly...' After reading this for the first time, a mortified Seymour had started wearing a handful of Pour un Homme. It wasn't for him, he knew, but it worked a treat. '' Then the knocking was repeated'continuously, and with growing insistence. I knew that the time for action had come, and forthwith drew the bolt of the northward connecting door, bracing myself for the task of battering it open. The knocking waxed louder, and I hoped that its volume would cover the sound of my efforts. At last beginning my attempt, I lunged again and again at the thin panelling with my left shoulder, heedless of shock or pain. The door resisted even more than I had expected, but I did not give in. And all the while the clamour at the outer door increased. Finally 'Cthulhu! I wish it meant 'Finally' but'' He flicked. 'It really doesn't,' said Seymour. 'To cut a", "label": 1}
{"text": "very, very long short story short'' he hissed at the cat-clock, ''the human escaped, I got the reputation of Village Idiot, and Lovecraft made my infamy famous by publishing this one-sided and libellous account. The end!' It felt good to get it out. Seymour shut 'Shadows over Innsmouth', slapped it on the hob, piled the paperwork in shifting reams above it, then lit the heap with a match and a rush of gas. He looked at the cat, then toppled it onto the now burning pile and walked toward the door. The cat ' now waving him off- sent several sheaves of blazing paper sailing across the studio, where they stuck and caught on beds and carpet alike, and the floorboards beneath them. There were strange, garbled shrieks from the level below, elided by the blaze, and Seymour considered urinating on the flames, on 'Shadows'' itself, in order to put it out. He decided not to. Instead, he sped from the flat as fast as the counter-waddle of his waist would allow. The kitchenette door led to an alleyway along which Seymour walked. He was returned to the side of the supermarket, and went from there back into the bar. He stared at the table they had hurriedly vacated. 'Vacant,' he murmured, searching for his book. 'Here you go,' said the barman. He pushed across the bar the pile of texts Seymour had been reading, the newspapers at its base rags to the spilt alcohol on its surface. On its crest was the orange first edition of How to Win Friends and Influence People. 'Had a look at it,' added the barman, nodding downward. 'Given how fast your friend got away from you, I'd recommend getting your money back, pal.' Seymour levered the pile into his valise and left, smiling. The book must we working, he reckoned; that's the first time anyone's called me pal. Mr Duffy and Jack Gittes sit in a row-boat on the lake at Echo Park. Mr Duffy rows. Jack Gittes smokes. Mr Duffy blows a kiss at Jack Gittes. Jack Gittes picks up a camera. Jack Gittes: Okay, pal. Let's have us a big smile. Hollis Mulwray rows past. Katherine Cross is his passenger. Jack Gittes (to a grinning Mr Duffy): You'll love it. Jack Gittes takes photographs of Hollis Mulwray and Katherine Cross. 3 - \"He Who Can Do This Has The Whole World With Him. He Who Cannot Walks A Lonely Way\" Inspire in others an eager want. I often went fishing up in Maine during the summer. Personally I am very fond of strawberries and cream, but I have found that for some strange reason, fish prefer worms. So when I went fishing, I didn't think about what I wanted. I thought about what they wanted. I didn't bait the hook with strawberries and cream. Rather, I dangled a worm or a grasshopper in front of the fish and said: \"Wouldn't you like to have that?\" Why not use the same common sense when fishing for people? 'I hope you don't mind,' said Noah Cross, 'but I left the heads on. I think it's the way it should be eaten.' Seymour shook his head and sunk his knife into what was left of the stomach. The guts had been removed and replaced with mutton. The silver knife was unsmiling as he raised it to his lips, the straight blade tight-lipped as Cross's serving man, beneath his thin moustache, behind them. 'My boy,' said Cross. 'Fork. You're murdering it.' He smiled but it only revealed his teeth and the sharpness of his eyes. The 'murdering' made Seymour think of August. A fork was passed to him by Cross's man. Carnegie wrote that those who cannot listen are uneducated, they may be well instructed, but they are uneducated. Seymour listened. Cross spoke. 'We caught him down by the town hall, along with the mutton,' he indicated the plater, which stretched along the marble table. Both heads: the shepherd's and the sheep's, were visible. The shepherd was the one from the town hall, who had shouted at Hollis Mulwray about creating the drought, and had then been led out. 'I make it my business, Seymour, to know what goes in and what goes out of this city. Like'' he paused, chewing and savouring, by the glint in his eye, the simile as much as the meat. '' the water in my reservoirs, I control the valves, the intake, the overflow. What becomes waste.' Here he looked at Seymour, and the glint was as metallic as the smile in Seymour's pocket. 'And if anybody makes it their business to spread rumours about what we're doing up in the hills- like this poor shepherd- then, well...' He let it hang, like his fork over the shepherd's spread ribcage. 'You're a successful man of business, Mr Cross,' Seymour said, meaning the business of man, as well as the business of murdering men. Give sincere and genuine appreciation. Principle 1. Noah Cross ignored this. 'I may not have many of my own teeth left in my head, but I got plenty of ears in town. I know things. I know I need my daughter back. I know Hollis Mulwray is trying to stop me getting my daughter back and trying to put a cork in our dam plans. I know August Derleth is still spreading that filthy truth about our people.' He glanced at Seymour, and returned to his meal. He was wearing a white shirt white flecked by fish scales the colour of pearl. His lips were rubbery like Seymour but not so pendulous. His eyes had the silty mud hue, not only in their irises but also their sockets, of having seen the kind of depths few could sink to. But for all this Noah Cross was a handsome devil. There may be demon's blood ' Dagon blood - in his veins, but it showed up only in the details of his skein: lips, eyes, the thinnest", "label": 1}
{"text": "of flaps between his fingers, the sharpest of nails at their ends, the way he ate humans. He swallowed the food, and continued. 'I know I want you to be successful, son. I want you to want to be successful. You are of the line of both the Marshes and the Crosses; where those lines intersect. You were born to be a success.' Arouse in others an eager want. Principle 3. He smiled, his rubbery lips wrapping around the lines of his teeth. 'You look at your aptitude with a knife.' Here, Cross stared at Seymour's stomach. 'When you can get close enough, and you will be a success.' Cross nodded as he said it, a man used to his word being enough to carry a conversation. 'You will.' Seymour put down the silver fork. 'I'm reading'' He started, but could not continue. His appetite had gone and his voice had followed it. The mutton is rubbery as both their lips, as mutton often is, but Seymour dared not say so, daring only to say- as he always did- what he thought Noah Cross wanted to hear. Today, at least, How to Win Friends and Influence People confirmed that cowardice was the correct course to take. Cross interrupted the thought. 'This okie here,' he indicated the meal Seymour had been considering, the human he was digesting. The brown eyes, bulbous with fear and, judging by the red lines at where the neck hadn't been tanned, strangulation. 'Shepherd rides a horse down into town like it makes him the big man. Damn Okie's don't drive cars and when they do those cars don't drive, right? Rusting buckets, is that what they say?' Cross didn't wait to be corrected. 'Anyway, the shepherd's horse is just as compliant as the shepherd's mouth so we're set to fixing both. I like compliant. You'll see the horse in a minute.' He was still eating, and 'horse' came out as 'ors'; came out along with the whiff of human flesh. The shepherd lay on a platter nearly the length and width of the marble table. He had been gutted and stuffed with one of his own flock. A shepherd/sheep roulade. 'Seymour, I like to get my way and if I can do that with everybody smiling and feeling like they got their way too, well, that's the way I'll do it.' He smiled, in turn, as he carved from the shepherd's mouth, taking the tongue from sauce it looked to be marinating in. It drooled deep brown, with flecks of red Seymour didn't think was blood but possibly diced chillies. Spiced tongue. It wagged invitingly. 'Want the tip?' asked Cross with a smile that could only be described as charming. Seymour nodded, wordlessly, at least for a moment. Then; 'I'm reading this book, Mr Cross,' he tried. 'I'm going to use it to...' 'You and books. Reading them,' he wiped a line of juice from his chin. It came from the shepherd's tongue. 'Starring in them. Is starring the right word?' It wasn't. Seymour felt the flush again. It rose with images of every way in which he had failed. His heart beat and seemed to beat him down in his seat. He always sat hunched when he ate with Cross, but now he crunched almost double, sweating more with each beat in his chest. Noah Cross said, 'Worst kind of writer that Lovecraft. Autobiography dressed up as fantasy. As horror.' He looked to have something distasteful in his mouth. He had finished the shepherd's tongue. 'A man should just come out and say it was him, and what happened, instead of pretending to be this... character. Yes. Yes, we were pleased when you ended that excuse for literature, for a writer. Truth dressed up as lies, nothing worse. Lily-livered...' Liver, thought Seymour, distracted, finally, from his failures. He could use a nice drink with that. He gestured for Cross's man. '... Show our face to the world. That's what we'll do, when the Great One comes, yes?' Seymour nodded. His mouth was full of tongue and liver and wine. Cross glanced up from the course. 'Well maybe not your face,' he said. Cross carved. 'You've been here a month, is that right, Seymour? I sent for you, you came, I'm happy. You did a good job in New England.' Give honest and sincere appreciation. Principle 2. 'Got right close to that writer, your looks wouldn't have hurt out East, no, you look pretty similar, you and Lovecraft. Not pretty not ugly, just pretty ugly.' Cross laughed, then wiped his mouth with a serviette. His man replaced the serviette. 'In your travels down the Appalachians and the Louisianan swamps, and the bayou, even in Mexico looking for my daughter, and my other daughter, yeah, you would've fit right in. Funny looking folk in those places. But this is Los Angeles, Seymour; The Angels. If you were an angel, God wouldn't have called it heaven, yes?' Not principle 2, thought Seymour. Cross went further, 'You got to fit in, learn how to socialise, how to get close to your mark. Then, eventually, get under their skin...' Seymour glanced at Cross's knife. Cross continued stabbing. '' You've been here a month and there are still humans out there talking about Ancient Ones. Worse still,' Cross coughed, choking on what he was about to eat or what he is about to say. Momentarily, the shepherd's and the old man's eyes were the same size. He wiped his mouth with the back of his sun-tanned hand. 'Promoting that writing in public gatherings. Can't go on, Seymour. August Derleth can't go on.' He put down his blade and his man took it, and Cross rose, and the man took his chair, as he did everything, in a smooth, continuous, plucking motion, like longshore drift taking grains from a cliff. The same plucking seemed to have occurred on the man's scalp and his upper lip, where his moustache and fringe were thinning,", "label": 1}
{"text": "and further in his eyes, the hope of which had all but eroded. He wore the white, long jacket of a butcher. The serving of humans to non-humans must do little for a man's sanity, thought Seymour. As Cross rose, the planks under his feet creaked. They were on a pier. Opposite, over water that glinted like his eyes (like the sea knew things humans didn't) was an impressive, rotunda shaped, white plank building. Seymour had no idea of its purpose. Above them, was a squarer abode, with a placard hanging from its side, its heraldry a fish, face down, as though held by the bracket as a catch from the sea. The building seemed to be saying, look at this damn fish, wonder how much that weighs. The sign read 'ABC', which stood for 'Albacore Club', which was Cross's club, owned entirely. When he rose, Seymour did also and they walked along the pier, running left of the clubhouse, to where a Ford V8 De Luxe waited. They got in and sat in the leather perfumed shade of its back seat. The car was cool, not just the leather but the planes of its door, the curve of its silvered handle. Seymour imagined they had been brought out of a garage, just now, by the driver, so that they could travel in comfort. This was, of course, a fantasy. So Mr Cross could travel in comfort. Seymour remembered the remains of the shepherd, stretched out by the sea, seagulls circling, and thought, What a waste. I hope they save the cuts for the refrigerator. The drive was short, up through a cleft in the cliffs to a small-holding, and they passed a number of horses, dressed up to their pointed ears, cantering down toward the seafront. 'Sheriff's gold posse,' Cross said, more to himself than me, Seymour thought. 'Damn fools.' He didn't say why. Cultivated palm trees gave way to coast oaks, the latter's canopy a dreary green, a dreary, weary green greyed in places by the sun, branches raggedy as nails drawn down a face. The car twisted up against itself from the waterline into the Hills until they reached long picketed gallops, white washed in conspicuous wooden slats over the brown dusty earth. The strength of the contrasts, made Seymour unsurprisingly think of red wheelbarrows and the way humans have of drawing thick lines through nature. The car slowed as they approached the gate of a gallop, within which a group of shirted, belt buckled men stood at its edge, in the shade of two thin oaks. Their Stetsons (white, also, or cream) were a cloud formation, bobbing above the group, which dispersed slowly as Cross stepped out and, as if he were a man of the land and not the abyss, strode out into the dust. They welcomed him but not Seymour, as the latter followed, kicking up short, flat plumes - like dispirited djinn - from his lamed left leg. Seymour palmed his hand above his eyes, as though scanning the horizon, through really he was close to blinded. The sun was high in the sky, and everywhere. Bleaching the leaves, white-washing the dirt, even the shade was made clear cut, shadow puppetry dancing where the wind forced its way off the sea, between the hills, and into the impinging glare. Seymour was close to the gathering, now, close enough to see between their legs to those of a horse. Rope was tied between the two thin oaks, the ends of which were miller-knotted about the hind legs of a grey horse. The horse seemed to have long given up kicking. A man knelt between the legs, careful, by the stoop of his head, not to bob upward above the cocked knees. Cock, was the next thought Seymour had, as the man held a pair of silvered scissors over the equine scrotum. Cock- it was hard to miss. 'Why ya doing this Bill?' Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language. Part 2. Principle 3. The man between the horses' legs looked up at them. He squinted, and pulled his hat down to shade against the glare of the sky. He wasn't wearing a Stetson but a flat cap, what Los Angeles boys called an Okie-cap, on grey hair that was fluffed and going white at the edges in a manner that made you think of dandruff, though there was none on his shirted shoulders. 'Won't ride straight, sir,' he said. His eyes were blood shot, but in dots, like the aftermath of grapeshot. His blue eyes were nearer grey; their colour must have been what was bleeding away. Cross said nothing, but nodded. 'Won't answer to no-one but that shepherd, sir.' Seymour's stomach rumbled. 'Won't do what he's tole.' Cross muttered from the corner of his mouth toward Seymour's left ear. 'In medieval Europe the kings had a saying. Castrate your sons, fuck your daughters. You remember that, son.' Cross hardly ever called him son. This may because he wasn't Seymour's father. On the other hand, maybe he was. It was hard to tell, in their family. They could just as easily have been brothers. Bill looked to Seymour, then back to his employer. The wrinkles on Bill's forehead arched deep as the slits from the scissors. Cross gestured to the castration site. 'Go about your job, Bill, please,' he said. Bill did, razoring open the scrotum in quick, short, expert cuts, twisting out the innards in a long root of white, bulbed at the end by the bollock. Bill set a clamp to the white chord and then, with a two-handle cutter ' and with a creaking clicking like that of a telephone line before the operator connects the call ' he pinched and cut, severing the ball. The horse, grey hide mottled by white and by brown dust, twitched here, loosening some of the soil, but did not neigh. Bill, bent close", "label": 1}
{"text": "to the equine groin, crouched still, holding the emasculator in place for what felt like a good time, though it may have been a couple of minutes, before releasing it, alongside a thin runoff of blood. There was less of this than Seymour had expected (though he had expected none of this) and it was cherry red. With a second clamp and cut, Bill returned to the other bollock, severing it, holding, holding, holding, then releasing, before untying the miller's knot. Seymour noticed that his stomach would not untie, and that his groin tightened below it as Bill unlooped the knot and stood back. Cross didn't move and Seymour stayed unflinchingly at his side. That was what this was all about wasn't it? The castration, thought Seymour. The horse's legs drooped, but it didn't move. Seymour thought it strangely submissive for the situation it was in. Then, he reconsidered. 'He'll be up and about in no time, sir,' said Bill. 'He'll run true now onwards, wouldn't know he'd been contrary.' Cross turned to Seymour. 'Make sure he does, Bill.' He walked away, leaving Seymour to hobble back down to the coast road and along the front. It was a long way and, in the shade between the hills, good for thinking. Mainly, he thought of Katherine. [In white font on black, with the black clouded and smoky at the edges] Her hair was the yellow of the scales of a snake, each strand as languid and angular and serpentine in its unspooling into the Atlantic water, and every follicle as thick and as long as infant anacondas. All of it was blurred, blurred by being in his peripheral vision, by his vision being that of a baby (an infant Dagon) and - this being a memory - by time. It all blended with the smoky clouds of forgetting and with the dappled sunlight winking off the surface of the ocean in the memory, as turning Massachusetts's leaves wink in autumnal winds that rush in off this sea. The dappling sun and undulating horizons are as infinite as the memory of his mother. She held Seymour and they drifted seemingly forever on the tide of his early infancy, not untethered but bobbing back and forth as though she were his anchor. Elsewhere, her tentacles wrapped about him, hidden darkly by the copper-rust green waves. She was monstrous and sang the songs the Ancient World said were sung only by sirens. To Seymour they were the lullabies of home and on the nights when he couldn't sleep he would wrap his arms around his body and whisper them and finally drift away.

Why not study the technique of the greatest winner of friends the world has ever known? Who is he? You may meet him tomorrow coming down the street. When you get within ten feet of him, he will begin to wag his tail. If you stop and pat him, he will almost jump out of his skin to show you how much he likes you. And you know that behind this show of affection on his part, there are no ulterior motives: he doesn't want to sell you any real estate, and he doesn't want to marry you. Did you ever stop to think that a dog is the only animal that doesn't have to work for a living? A hen has to lay eggs, a cow has to give milk, and a canary has to sing. But a dog makes his living by giving you nothing but love. Seymour chewed the orange rind ' the accessory to his now 'normal please' Angel Face cocktail ' in what he hoped was the casual manner of the casual drinker. This hope ended when the rind hit him in the wide, wet hemisphere of his left eye, then rebounding as he hissed in pain, splattering saliva across the page he was reading before he swallowed it whole, in shock, the bumps on the ragged skin feeling to the inside of his throat like receiving bad news by telegram. Somebody's death, perhaps; quite possibly his own. No human came over to help him. He choked for some time but tried to do so, casually. The crying and further dribbling did not help him, in this, so he forced a pose of continuing to read, which was hard to do with eyes that bulged more even than Seymour's usual toadie looks. The reading came easier as breath returned to his lungs. For several pages he may have been weeping over the words but it was not because How to Win Friends and Influence People was a weepy. The emotion of Carnegie's writing was indescribable to Seymour. It wasn't subtle, complex, or several-noted but Seymour had never felt this way before. This was joy. The elation of something that would connect the jarring, disparate jig-sawed pieces of experience and make of them one image; the scene of Seymour's own, future happiness. Of everything coming together, and not in the normal way for Seymour's life; a Smile with a human's skin, though these both were certainly evolved. How to Win Friends and Influence people did so much more than it said on its tin.

Handel composed music in his brain which would have happily complemented a firework display. The demonic half felt nauseated. Along with his perspective, Seymour looked up, past his reading material. It was a mound, and he had to crane. First, the second green edition of How to Win Friends and Influence People, second the Los Angeles Times, which topped the Racing Record. Seymour shut the top of the pile and bookmarked his page with a repeatedly folded Record Post. At the base of it all, the sombre, warm eyes of Sea Biscuit stared out from the Racing Record, and Seymour was glad it was that head he could see, and not the other end of the equine. Seymour was unsurprised to see a dog - made to look rabid by the weather and a lack of water, twitching, head low, tongue foaming, eyes black cracks ' move along the line of shops next to the 'COCKTAILS' bar. The way it roamed put him in mind of his teeth, of a shark, continually in motion, hunting, but without energy enough to move in a burst unless bursts were worth their pound of flesh. This wasn't coincidence, Seymour thought; you could look up any second in Chinatown and see an animal like this, desperate and low like this, and if it wasn't a dog it could just as well be a human. Seymour had been looking for several hours since returning from Catalina Island, but he had not seen August Derleth. He'd have to skulk back soon, thought Seymour; his bags were still there. People crossed to Seymour's side of the street in order to avoid the dog. It isn't often I can say people cross to my side of the street, thought Seymour, and he allowed himself a smile. Luckily, in the shadows of the bar few could see it. 'Hey friend,' Seymour said. The barman stared at him. 'Hey...' he replied, leaving a space where the friend went. Seymour slid a ten dollar note across the bar. 'I've left my details with some friends, and they could ring for me. I'm going across there...' Seymour nodded to the police across the street. 'Will you let me know?' The barman looked at the note. Alexander Hamilton's face must have been more attractive to him than Seymour's because he didn't look up when he said, 'Sure.' Seymour leaned toward the bar. 'I bet you have a lot of friends, right friend?' 'I am not giving you any information about my life,' said the barman, who then walked away to clear glasses from the tables. Seymour stared back across the street. The detritus of Chinatown had drawn policemen, black in their uniforms as flies, and just as busy bodied. Amongst them stood a grey suited detective. Grey suited, grey haired, grey stubbled, to the eye he had all the attraction of a smudge at the corner of a well turned page; he was a smear under a beige fedora. They were all outside the entrance to August's apartment. Seymour rose and with him; his confidence. Inside, he felt influenced by the book. Outside, he was just as ugly as he always had been. As he rose, the dog entered the grocers to his left, and was chased out by a man waving a tin of tomatoes. Possibly plums; it was difficult to tell from Seymour's distance. The man was shouting in a foreign language Seymour didn't understand but which he thought was not Mandarin. The dog, unperturbed, approached another human ' a woman- who swore in English and shied away, grabbing a small boy and twisting the child's arm away. The boy yelled in no particular tongue and the dog, ever-moving, checked again, trotting fluidly into the street. There was a jolting BANG as the first passing car hit it, and Seymour used the jam this caused (dark red and lumpy), to cross the road, slip between the policemen, and approach the detective. 'Detective Loach,' he said. He had, amongst his papers, a map, and several notepads, pens, and the aforementioned Record Post (folded open to the Puzzles Section), and he inclined the latter toward Loach in the action of doffing a cap. 'Who, me?' the detective asked. Not; who are you? Not a flinch at Seymour's stench or ugliness. Not even a; what do you think you're doing here, and who the Hell do you think you are? Seymour had his man. 'I'm Seymour,' he said, answering the questions the detective should have asked. 'I'm with the Times.' Another doff. Loach stared at Seymour, then looked away, then looked again, uncomprehending. He was the kind of man, Seymour could tell, who deferred to another, and, when divested of another to defer to, would seek somebody to bully. He was short, moreover, which could only help Seymour. Seymour was quite tall. 'You know Whitey Horowitz?' The detective nodded. 'Down at the Times?' Another nod. 'Why,' Seymour was closer now. 'Me and ol' Whitey been having a bit of tete-a-tete, you know what I mean?' Loach frowned, his leathery forehead wrinkling in one horizontal line like an old person's purse snapping shut. Seymour pressed on. 'He says that Lieutenant Escobar was promoted for catching Two Guns Crawley, you know, back in the spring. Whitey, well Whitey says everybody knows he did it on his own, and that's why he got the promo, you know?' Looked at Seymour. Looked away, nodded. 'But I said to him, you know Whitey, I followed that case real close, and it wasn't Escobar that cracked it, it was that guy Loach, Detective Loach if you will. So Escobar can't have got Lieutenant over it 'cause it was all Loach's hard-shoeing work, right?' This time, only the look, and there is something down in there like Seymour glimpses in his dreams, in the deep of it, a thought unfurling", "label": 1}
{"text": "kind of pressure. With sides two and a half to one, 112 feet high and a 12 acre...' Mulwray was talking numbers and Seymour glanced back at the crossword and at the other names written there. What use was geometry to him? In his day to day life, Seymour only needed to count as high as the number of bodies. Across the page from the crossword was an advert. Eight Things This Book Could Do For You. It read, ' 1. Get out of a mental rut, think new thoughts, acquire new visions, discover new ambitions. ' 2. Make friends quickly and easily. ' 3. Increase your popularity. ' 4. Win people to your way of thinking. ' 5. Increase your influence, your prestige, your ability to get things done. ' 6. Handle complaints, avoid arguments, keep your human contacts smooth and pleasant. ' 7. Become a better speaker, a more entertaining conversationalist. ' 8. Arouse enthusiasm among your associates. Seymour took a pen from his black jacket pocket (he heard it clink there as the nib slid past metal) and used it to absentmindedly underline 'human' three times. Beside the text was a photograph of a bespectacled man with an expression of magnanimous benevolence not unlike that of Roosevelt's (Fred not Ted). The photograph might as well have said, I believe in your ability. Most likely, it would have added 'son'. In actuality, the portrait was captioned 'Dale Carnegie, author of the life changing book How to Win Friends and Influence People'. Hollis Mulwray said, 'It won't stand. I won't build it. It's as simple as that.' Hollis was talking about the dam but Seymour couldn't care less about this and, instead of listening, he read, 'Carnegie's book signing tour continues at the Avalon Theatre, Catal...' His reading was interrupted by 'boo'ing. Seymour looked up at the audience, many of whom were now stood in their mahogany pews. Most of those standing were farmers, with their pale eyes the colour of their sun-bleached denim shirts, bled dry by hard work on unforgiving land, exsanguinated as Los Angeles itself had been by the drought. They needed the dam built or more importantly; the reservoir behind it. 'Boo,' they shouted. The 'boo'ing abruptly became 'baa'ing. In the pew to the right of Seymour, Gittes turned and grinned wolfishly at an influx of sheep, herded by a shepherd clothed in brown. Brown by way first of his fat hat, then of his staff, to the base of his britches, his shoes, tan flat to the brown square tiles of the town hall's flooring. 'Get them the Goddam out of here,' an official shouted from the dais. Another town-hall man urgently picked up the telephone. Calling the sheep police? quipped Seymour, to himself. Never herd of them. He would have smiled, but smiling was too much effort. His lips were heavy on his thick-set, yellowed teeth, like eels swollen on a hot, Catalinian boardwalk. 'Show me where to take 'em,' shouted the shepherd. 'You don't have an answer for that so quick, do you? You steal water from our valley. Tell me who's paying you to do this, Mr Mulwray?' In the confusion of sheep, Seymour glanced at the two other names on his list. The remaining humans he had to kill. The clue for 3 down read, 'Golden wind, of summer'. In the crossword was written, pleasingly for Seymour, 'August'. Pleasingly, because playing with words and completing crosswords was the one part of his life which was not a slow pod toward death; his death; the death of his targets. After 'August' -in the white border- the surname was added- 'Derleth'. 1 across read simply, 'K Cross'. He folded the paper and closed his eyes and imagined Katherine Cross for a while as he often did, and the 'baa'ing subsided. Then he rose from the pew. Turning left, he waddled to the edge of the hall, and left that way. Behind him, Jack Gittes watched Hollis Mulwray. This was just fine as far as Seymour was concerned; he had other fish to fry. By which he meant; humans to gut. A Word of Cross to complete. [A picture of crossword with all the names of targets in its answer boxes - H Mulwray - August Derleth - Ida Sessions - Leroy Shudarht - K Cross] A Cadillac Fleetwood 75 drives down the dusty track beside Hollenbeck Bridge. It stops. Jack Gittes steps back into the shelter of a ruined pillar. He raises a pair of binoculars. In the sight of the binoculars, Hollis Mulwray walks across the dried-out bed of the Los Angeles River. He stares at the dust below him then approaches a boy who is riding a white horse. Suggestions on How to Get the Most Out of This Book 1. If you wish to get the most out of this book, there is one indispensable requirement, one essential infinitely more important than any rule or technique. What is this magic requirement? Just this: a deep, driving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to increase your ability to deal with people. 2. Read each chapter rapidly at first to get a bird's-eye view of it. You will probably be tempted then to rush on to the next one. But don't - unless you are reading merely for entertainment. 3. Stop frequently in your reading to think over what you are reading. Ask yourself just how and when you can apply each suggestion. 4. Read with a crayon, pencil, pen, magic marker or highlighter in your hand. When you come across... a four-star suggestion, then underscore every sentence or highlight it, or mark it with \"****.\" Marking and underscoring a book makes it more interesting, and far easier to review rapidly. 5. If you want to get a real, lasting benefit out of this book, don't imagine that skimming through it once will suffice. After reading it thoroughly, you ought to spend a few hours reviewing it every month. There is", "label": 1}
{"text": "like the movement of a tentacle in the deepest sea. The water down in Loach's gaze looked murky, bloodied, soured. Carcasses, big ones, had drifted downward to rot. 'So the lieutenant must've got lieutenant over something else, right? I mean, it was your good work on the Two Guns case, wasn't it and all?.. Pardon me for asking.' 'Yes,' he said and sometime later he repeated it. 'Yes.' 'So, you're probably thinking, what does this Times reporter want with me now, all these months after the spring. Yes?' Again, 'Yes.' 'Well, to prove it to Whitey Horowitz, I'm gonna write this article see, all about your methods, the man himself in action.' Seymour framed his next words carefully with his fingers, as one might a screen or a headline. 'Two Guns Killer's Catcher.' He can't help it 'Loach ' but the waters of his eyes were visibly warming to this. His gaze looked tepid, almost comfortable. Seymour scribbled on my notepad. 'The man himself, Detective Loach'' He dictated. Seymour glanced up. 'Could I just maybe take a minute of your time? Just a minute mind, for you to explain your methods, how you do it, a quick see; a peep?' Loach clapped Seymour on the shoulder. A short man trying to reassert his hold over the situation, clasping Seymour as he did so, having to stretch, to reach up. 'I can do better than that,' he said. 'Igor was it?' 'Sure,' Seymour said. 'You can watch me at work. Come down this way, right, Igor, under this laundry.' Under? thought Seymour. Then: Derleth's place wasn't on this level. 'Hey,' a policeman was back from the crash. 'You can't go down there.' Loach popped his head back up from the shadows. 'It's alright I'll make sure Igor here doesn't hurt himself.' They did go down. Down a twisting Victorian staircase, down below the level of Derleth's flat. 'Does this lead to the fire?' asked Seymour. 'Fire?' said Loach, face managing to be grey even in the pitch shadows. 'Oh... the fire started in the storey above. Well, above ish. This place is like a rabbit warren. Full of fuckers.' Loach laughed. In the dark, Seymour didn't bother to smile. They levelled off on a corridor lit by paraffin lamps that had been left burning despite the acrid, smirched air. Loach led the way, all pitter-pitter of short strides on metal and breathless patter from his mouth. 'The fire started on the level above. We don't think it's anything to do with the bodies...' Bodies below August's apartment? Against every instinct in his Dagon flesh, Seymour could not help but think; this isn't a coincidence. Loach continued, 'Some of the bodies have been moved, now, to Morty down at the morgue, but we've one or three left.' He stopped before the door below the one Seymour had entered that morning. 'This going to be an article is it, in the Times?' 'Oh yes, sir, our public are real interested in real police-work done by real, real detectives like yourself, sir.' The idea of this must have swelled Loach, because he had to bend as much as Seymour in order to enter the doorway at the end of the corridor. 'As you can see, this is the work of some real sicko. The stuff you find here in Chinatown, well, I can't even begin to tell you. This isn't even the worst of it.' If there were more shadows then objects in the room directly above, there seemed in this room to be more body parts than bodies. Here were more beds, to begin with, than three, and on each of these at least one occupant was chained. The beds creaked as their occupants moved and groaned in what Seymour, this time, was sure was Mandarin. The police had brought their own lamps in with them, electric lamps, and the humans on the beds shied away from their buzz and glow. It took a moment of blinks in the hard electric glare for Seymour to realise that these humans had few or no teeth, and were gnashing their gums. Somehow, the noise was brittle, as though they had worn these to the bone. 'Yes?' said Loach, stretching onto the balls of his feet. 'God awful isn't it. The mess. They take it all you know, for medicine, drugs. Their bones and some of their organs. Keep them alive long as they can so they can take some more.' said Loach. 'Fetches a pretty price, ends up in a widdle bottle.' Loach demonstrated with thumb and forefinger. Nothing about this was pretty, thought Seymour, nodding in reply to Loach. For the first time, looking at Loach's utter unconcern at suffering, Seymour felt human. He perched his pen against his notepad. 'How did you find this door, this room? Were there clues?' 'The fire.' Loach pointed upward, then down, circling with his point a small pile of fallen rubble beneath a hole in the ceiling. A porcelain paw could be seen caught mid wave, emerging from the ashes. Seymour wondered if it could pull itself out, drag its chinaware self across the floor toward him. Under its paw was a sheaf of paper. Seymour bent to pluck it out. The feline would not give it up, for a moment, before it came free with a riiiiiip, a tear through the name below the signature. 'Well, of course you can put this in your notepad,' continued Loach, as he did so. 'I noticed the stench as soon as I went in after the fire had finished. Not much of a blaze, and looking down here I was the first to hear the rattle and moaning going on. The first.' A policeman by the door fidgeted as though itchy. He coughed, and the cough sounded like 'dick'. Loach started, turned, then looked back at the ceiling. 'Bit of luck really, for this case, that fire starting. Wouldn't a clue otherwise. Well, that's Chinatown, ain't it? Always some", "label": 1}
{"text": "shit going down.' 'And you must be hot on the heels of the arsonist,' said Seymour, thinking the pun made him sound like a newspaperman. 'Nah,' Loach tried to spit phlegmatically on the floor, but the strand of it hung from his lips and he was forced to pinch it off and wipe it on his trousers and point at the hole in the ceiling with his other hand in an attempt to distract Seymour. 'Fires happens all the time in Chinatown. The place is a tinderbox, a real tinderbox.' A tied victim moaned. He... no, thought Seymour; she...no... it... that part of him that made him so had been removed... was staring at Seymour. Seymour guessed tongue also fetched a good price. He recalled the shepherd's and his own began to salivate. He flicked up a fresh page of his notebook and said, 'Just wait while I get that down,' but, instead, he noted the particulars of the letter he held. It was a rejection slip from Simon and Schuster. Dear Mr Derleth, We note from our records that we have already rejected your story on five occasions. We further note that it is not written by you, and you therefore have no right to submit it for publication. We understand your championing the cause of another writer, but please could you leave such applications to Mr Lovecraft himself. He, at least, seems well aware of the mediocrity of his work, if he has declined to submit his own story. Yours, [Signature] L. Shimkin Seymour stared at light coming down from the hole in the ceiling, then at the so called bodies, most of which stared back, then around the room, at the scattered, unwashed medical equipment. Everything needed for organ transplant (receptacles, cutters, small electric heaters for cauterisation) was present. A noisy business, concluded Seymour, if it were not for their lack of a tongue between them, and for the Chinese laundry next door. 'You know,' he rose, and placed his notepad in his pocket. 'This is a big result, Detective Loach. I can see you getting out of Chinatown after this, like the lieutenant did. You know, big - like shooting down a criminal in the street.' Nod, 'Yeah,' nod, 'yeah.' A waiting stillness, as a lizard watches a juicy fly. 'You gonna write that up, right?' asked Loach. 'Me and Whitey Horowitz. I've written that down,' Seymour pointed at his notepad. 'He's gonna write it up.' Loach gave out a forced, harsh laugh. 'Nice...' he said, face and tongue lizardine as they searched for the word '... wordplay'. Loach didn't find it, and, after a pause he repeated, 'Nice' Now the next thing - you can add this - is the morgue up to the station, and Morty. He'll tell me about when they died, and that kind of thing, all very scientific, you know, but I get it. I get it. You can write that down.' 'Dick-tective,' said a voice from the door. It was the policeman. It was hard to miss the first syllable, but Loach managed to do so. The policeman tilted his head in a backwards nod. 'Hang on,' said Loach, leaving the room. Seymour looked at the chinaman who looked at him. Below the smeared blood, the human's eyes were red. They could not be rubbed, as the captive's hands would not extend that far. He seemed to be offering his throat, as might the Brides of Dracula, Seymour supposed, if he believed in that kind of thing. Seymour felt a stirring in his chest, and then, as though infected blood pumped from the heart there, an itching hot sensation down his right arm, to the hand that normally held his Smile. He wondered what the feeling was. Having had so little experience with the concept of 'Mercy', he might as well have thought the word was the name for a human hooker. His fingers itched to retrieve his blade. 'Uhhhh.... huhhhhh,' said the human, as if agreeing. 'Hey!' Seymour turned around, and then round again, back to the same chinaman. 'Hey, ugly!' He looked up through the hole to Derleth's kitchenette. It was the barman. 'You got a call!' The barman held little finger and forefinger to his face, separated by a row of thick knuckles. 'They said, go to Elmacondo Apartments.' He looked around the edge of the hole to the edges of the room in which Seymour stood. 'Jesus,' he added. 'You gonna have to pay me more money next time.' 'Hey,' said Seymour softly, but with enough volume to reach the floor above. He withdrew his Smile from his jacket pocket and stabbed the chinaman in the neck. The meat of the barman's face whitened like frying pork. The hue of the chinaman's neck went the opposite direction- raw then red. 'See,' said Seymour. 'You were right. Angel Face.' Stab, the Smile in his hand went. 'God,' said the barman. Stab. Stab. Stab. Seymour replied, proceeding around the room. Later, he would think it strange that Loach, on his return, did not notice the difference. Not only in the bodies, but, and he wondered how this could be true, in Seymour. Jack Gittes crawls through a belfry. He holds a camera. He looks down on a courtyard where Hollis Mulwray reads a newspaper. Katherine Cross enters the courtyard. Jack Gittes takes pictures.

{"text": "man in the driving seat was known in Cross' crew as the White Mouse, on account of his height and his hue (both clothes and skin). He had a fish he called 'Goldfish' on account, Seymour could only suppose, of it being a red piranha. He kept it in a small tank, roped to the passenger seat beside him. 'In the back, yes. Goldfish rides up front, huh?' said the White Mouse, as Seymour lumbered across the street. Claude Mulverhille, one of the heavies of Cross' network, sat on the opposite side to Seymour- at the back. The suspension of the car gave a creak both fast and elongated enough to sound like a whine as Seymour got in and sat next to him. Seymour smiled at Claude. Claude's face was as pleasant as a summer's day, if that day were overcast, drizzling down every crease in your clothing, and was the day on which you were destined to die horribly. Claude's nose was aquiline, in contrast to the wide planes of the rest of his face, giving his head the look of an anchor. His eyes, however, hid no depths, festering with a rage that was very much on the surface. Claude turned a stare on him. 'Budge back along,' he said. 'Your ass is fucking huge.' The White Mouse laughed as he started the car. 'Yes, he puts the 'ass' in 'assassin', yes.' The White Mouse spoke in an Eastern European accent. Often, Seymour nodded and smiled. Mulverhille, however, seemed to understand him. 'Both the asses,' growled Mulverhille. Seymour tried. 'I can't move,' he replied, still smiling. Some saliva made his shirt. Claude's face wrinkled around its centre in the expression of somebody forced to clean up somebody else's faeces. 'God, are you smiling?' He made a fake retching sound into his closed lips. He said, 'Stop that right now. Your mouth looks like a cunt that's been recently raped.' Seymour did so, wiping his lips, chin, and chest, in hurried, humiliated twitches. Seymour's skin flushed its old-bowl of probably-diseased-urine puce. He gulped loudly enough to be audible to the car in front, he thought. He gulped again, nodding his head downward as though his chin might lid the noise. It didn't. Seymour gulped. Mulverhille shook his head and shifted to his own body right, affronted, wiping at his jacket with a kerchief as though the side of it had been soiled. The car accelerated up the main street. 'Can't sit in the front because he's got his bloody 'Goldfish' up there,' he said, craning his neck so that the White Mouse could hear him. 'Quiet in the back, huh, yes? Fuckface,' said the White Mouse. Claude did not deign to look directly at Seymour but inclined his head and voice in his direction. 'Calls it a Goldfish even though it ain't gold and it ain't a goldfish.' The White Mouse swerved to avoid a car and swore. In the shotgun-seat, the fish tank splashed water on the upholstery. 'Schei'e!' The White Mouse repeated. 'How many times you lump of shat animal matter, huh, no? Faeces face?' he clarified. 'A goldfish ain't gold is it? It's orange...' 'But they're actually called red piranhas. Because they're red!' 'Well you're not all red are you my pretty...' The White Mouse reached in and adroitly poked his pet piranha in the right eyeball. The fish twitched and cast about with its sharp teeth. In the water was a dismembered finger. One of the answers on Cross's Crossword could no longer fill in the Puzzle Section, Seymour guessed. The piranha, in lieu of his abuser's, chewed on this. 'And you,' continued the White Mouse, 'are you Claude coloured, are you Claude shaped. No? No, you fuckface animal faeces, you - you're brown hat, brown jacket, and lumpy and you're Claude smelling, yes, like the shit you are!' 'Yeah, thanks for clarifying that vermin features,' sneered Claude. 'Yea, fuck you, I should crash but if I did your mangled face would look just the same'' The White Mouse's eyes flicked across the mirror, '' and Seymour would look better, no?' 'Yes! No! Yes! No!' mimicked Mulverhille rocking his head back and forth, a satisfied grin on his lips, like a jack in the box that had just sprung. 'At least Goldfish is useful. He eats up my enemies, I put a finger or a nose in and I don't get no bother any more, no? No, Goldfish,' The White Mouse was muttering now. 'Keep it hungry and poke it in the eye every good morning, and it eats up a head like the sirloin beef, hmm, yes. I'd like to see him eat up your eyes. Don't think that'll worsen your abilities to see, no, not one bit, faeces face.' The White Mouse cruised toward the back of an already parked car then braked heftily. The fish tank sloshed. The Mouse was the only one of the three to tumble forward from his seat. Both Claude and Seymour would require more force to go anywhere. They got out. They had arrived at the Elmacondo Apartments. Two men wearing fedoras that drooped at their edges (with a hint of rubbery mouths that did the same) stood beside the car in front. Seymour recognised it as the same model (though not the same vehicle) as the one that had ferried him up to the Catalina ranch from the Albacore Club in Avalon Bay. Sighing, Claude opened his door and went to talk to the men. 'Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit and by God,' said Claude, on his return to the car. (He liked to remind Seymour of the ways in which their cultures ' and they - were different). 'I think I just met some folks even uglier than you.' He looked sidelong at Seymour. 'Or maybe not.' 'Well, more poo plopping out of your faeces face, huh, yes?' said the White Mouse. 'Yes!' shouted Mulverhille. 'Shut up, ye...' The White Mouse stopped halfway through", "label": 1}
{"text": "the affirmative. The two men had gotten into the car in front. Seymour could see the outline of Cross's Stetson through its back window. His Ford V8 De Luxe pulled away. 'Follow, eh? They don't bother to tell me, do they Goldfish? No,' muttered the White Mouse to his red piranha. 'Yes!' said Claude chuckling. 'Yes, follow, yes!' 'Fuck you.' Between chuckles, Mulverhille said, 'Mulwray and that bloody girl aren't here anymore. This is where they were earlier this afternoon. Gittes took photos. It's gonna be in the press and everything. That should flush the girl out! Mulwray's at home, and home alone.' Another sidelong look. 'It's time to finish what you couldn't... Hollis Mulwray,' he added, where clarification wasn't needed. The White Mouse followed Cross's sedan out into the hills, along Santa Tonia, taking a right down to Echo Park, cut left through this and past where Gittes had taken pictures of Mulwray and Katherine on the lake, right again toward Molino, and up into the hills of Pasadena, where the houses drew out like a relieved and then contented sigh. The owners of these homes had made it. As the drive progressed, Seymour slipped a hand inside his jacket pocket and touched the hilt of his Smile. He resolved to let people see his Smile, feel his Smile. He withdrew How to Win Friends and Influence People from his valise, opened it to' 'Principle 3 - Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.' ' And began to read. Claude, he was sure, would have commented negatively on this, if he could bear to look at Seymour. Claude couldn't. 'Jim Farley discovered early in life that the average person is more interested in his or her own name than in all the other names on earth put together. Remember that name and call it easily, and you have paid a subtle and very effective compliment. But forget it or misspell it - and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage.' Dusk approached Pasadena as the cars did, heavy with clouds as the Sedans were with heavies. They pulled up a long flagged drive between curving svards of green grass and parked in front of barred windows flanking a heavily lacquered, black door. In the remaining curve of the drive were parked a pearl-white Packard, and a dusty, blue Cadillac. The Packard, Seymour guessed, was Mrs Mulwray's. It said feminine in the way necklaces did in the glossy magazines. Crookedly (head and knees, then chest, before belly and bottom) Cross exited his Ford and beckoned by way of a single, crooked finger for Seymour to do the same. The other men and approximations of men stayed in the cars. They approached the door, Cross leaning on a cane with which he knocked on the its large, black panelling, leaving a shape like a question mark, like the end, Seymour thought, of Anybody home?.. or, more appropriately; Mulwray, are you ready to die? Mulwray's man-servant, Khan, opened the door. Confusingly, he wore a hat and coat, as though he was the one on the outside. Seymour said, 'Mr Noah Cross to see Mr Hollis Mulwray.' 'You wait here.' Khan shut the door. Jim Farley, Seymour thought. In his head it sounded like swear words. Seymour forced his smile to widen. His cheeks pained him. So close to his nose, the door's overlapping layers of varnish gave it a liquid look. Painted black, it put Seymour in mind of depths in the Atlantic, not far from the mouth of the River Inn, beyond the reef where the seabed drops away and he, in his youth, fell with it, sloughing off what was left of his humanity. He missed home. Khan opened the door. 'You go,' he said, addressing Cross. Cross stood, leaning on his cane, a smile on his lips so straight it could easily turn into a frown. Seymour thought of The Book. 'You don't feel like smiling? Then what? Two things. First, force yourself to smile. If you are alone, force yourself to whistle or hum a tune or sing. Act as if you were already happy, and that will tend to make you happy.' Seymour began to hum. Khan shut the door. 'Mr man-servant,' said Seymour after he had repeated the same notes for several bars. Always use their names. 'Khan! Khan- You dress and walk in a very proper manner. Did you go to a butler school for this? Is there a butler school... sorry,' he added hurriedly. 'I meant Butler University of course. University, Can't. Khan!' Cross shook his head. 'Work in damn progress,' he said. Then, much louder. 'Hollis, you come out here and talk to me like a man. Or should I be hollering for my daughter?' Seymour looked down and to the right and thought of Noah Cross's daughter (not that one, not the one Noah Cross meant- the pure one). It was an image that made Seymour smile. He did so, pushing his rubbery grin out toward the deep, impenetrability of the black wood. 'Go,' shouted Khan. There was a moment of muttering, carried distantly too them as if over the waves of lacquer. Then, the door opened wide enough to see one side of Hollis Mulwray's round-lensed glasses and that part of his face. He looked paler than usual which was to say; more ghost than corpse. That would change, thought Seymour, who didn't believe in such things as ghosts. 'You're not welcome here, Noah,' Mulwray said in a tone above a whisper but below a mutter. 'Where's my daughter?' 'Asleep. And I want her to stay that way.' To this end, Hollis slipped back through the door and closed it behind him. 'You shouldn't be here.' Cross stared at him. Leaned on his cane. Stared. 'You shouldn't let her drink so much. She says the craziest things when she's drunk. Wild lies. And I don't know why you're whispering.", "label": 1}
{"text": "A gunshot wouldn't wake her.' The acrid trail of the last sentence hung in the air. Hollis opened the door. Closed the door. He fidgeted and paused and thought. He eventually said, 'We'll go round the side,' nodding past the two parked cars. He opened the door, leaned in, whispered harshly. 'Khan. You can go. Thank you. No go, go it's fine. I'll be fine.' Seymour smiled, which was to say his face didn't change. It was getting harder not to change his face. Cross said, as Mulwray was turned away, 'When it's time, make it an accident...' Seymour nodded. '' and stop doing whatever you're doing with your face. It's really just upsetting. Boy!' Seymour recalled, 'You will probably find it difficult to apply these suggestions all the time. I know because I wrote the book, and yet frequently I found it difficult to apply everything I advocated.' then looked at Cross's expression, and stopped smiling. Hollis Mulwray slipped back through the door, and closed it behind him. 'Back this way,' he said, and led them past the parked cars and around the side of the house and, by a small, panelled gate, into the back garden, which was lit by electric lamps. A yellow parasol sagged despondently on a pole, white in that light, and squares and irregular hexagons of lush grass shimmered, wet by nearby sprinklers, glittering as the pond would have glittered, Seymour guessed, if it wasn't for all the clouds. Thick set rocks hunkered in the dark, and garlands of algae were onyx chains on the pond's surface. It rippled, occasionally, to the passage of the fish beneath. Most of the lights in the house itself were off. There was a moment of silence. 'So, 'said Seymour, thinking again of Chapter 2, Principle 1. 'You've got more water in your garden. You like water a lot. What is it about water that you like Water Commissioner Hollis Mulwray?' Mulwray stared at him. 'Is it because it's... runny... Hollis Mulwray?' 'Shut up, 'said Cross. 'I know what you're doing,' said Mulwray, but not to Seymour. Cross linked his spare thumb into the waistline of his trousers. 'Well you've always been the clever one, Hollis, cleverer than this old man, because I have no idea what you're talking about.' 'The water,' hissed Mulwray. Seymour, who was used to this kind of thing, thought he heard spittle on the grass. Seymour said, 'See. Water again.' Cross looked at Seymour. Even in the dark, Seymour could tell it was time to move away. He did so, walking to the pond and keeping going until he had reached the middle of it. Then, he submerged himself and lay with one ear above the water, breathed through his gills and listened. 'This! This!' said Mulwray. By the cackle of a newspaper being wrenched open, he wasn't talking about Seymour lying down in a pond. 'These people, buying up land for your bloody Dam. There! The obituaries! A dam that's not supposed to be going ahead.' 'Let me see,' said Cross. There was the slide of reading glasses from his jacket pocket. They clucked in the pressed palsy of his fingers. 'Damn silly ideas, Hollis.' The folksy charm. The hokum. In the water, Seymour smiled. Well, Cross was damn good at it. The water tasted salty. 'I haven't got time for this act, Noah. You denied it flatly outside the Pig And Whistle'' (he pronounced it with full connective) '' but there's no denying this.' The crunch of newspaper being pressed to Cross. Hollis again, 'And all of these people - all of these people buying your land - are dead!' 'Well now. It seems you've got a point.' 'Finally.' The seething, grating sound of a man not used to seething. The harsh, half-swallowed swear word of a mouth unused to profanity. 'Fucking finally.' Seymour felt the urge to push his head above the water, if only to see Mulwray enraged. Quite the sight, he thought. He denied himself. 'The point at which you will die,' said Cross. 'Wha...' The soft, verdant thud of a cane let fall to the grass. Softer: old, leathery hands on the cotton of a shirted chest. Expensive shoes back-peddling toward the pond. Grunting. Two men at the water's edge. Seymour felt it would be impolite to eavesdrop further. He rose and grasped Hollis from behind. All the sounds of Mulwray went backwards as Seymour hauled him into the water, in and under it. Momentarily, the wiry strength of Mulwray's limbs fought back, twisting in Seymour's grip like a corkscrew. Seymour kept them both below the surface, which now began to bubble, then to froth as a downpour began. Seymour held still and did the same with Mulwray, only Seymour's gills moving ' smoothly - open and closed, open, closed. Seymour felt Hollis fighting to stop his mouth doing the same thing. The pond tasted like home. Seymour hadn't realised it was salt water. No wonder no grass grew down here. Bad for grass. This was taking a while. Hollis's long limbs eeled about. Seymour twisted and slapped Mulwray's head against a rock. He turned and rammed Hollis's body against another rock. Now, Hollis's mouth was open. A glint of gold drifted past in a twinkle of light, like that of Mulwray's spirit giving up the ghost. His glasses, Seymour thought. Seymour imagined Mulwray's eyes without them, no longer bulged by his lenses, now only by asphyxiation. Seymour shouted 'more water, eh Mulwray?' in Mulwray's ear, with what little oxygen he had left in his lungs. Then, Seymour gave Mulwray a thumbs up. He could only imagine being reminded of his favourite thing and hearing his name would be reassuring, at a time like this. The water began to taste of blood, so Seymour kept flipping, this way and that, as though he were fully a fish, as if he were out of water. Hollis was dead. Seymour dragged him back onto the hexagon of grass around", "label": 1}
{"text": "the pond. Cross said, 'Accident, I said.' Seymour looked up, wet and confused. The downpour added to the first. 'Did he trip and bang his head on a rock then get up and trip and bang his body on a rock?' Cross stopped, looking momentarily as Seymour felt. He touched his temples. 'Damn, I dropped my reading glasses, now where have they gone?' The heavies from the car, perhaps hearing the initial struggle and maybe being too heavy to move quickly enough to join it, arrived in the garden by the side gate. One of them stood beside Noah Cross and opened an umbrella above his head. 'Take him to his car, find the keys and take the body down to the reservoir,' said Cross, patting his chest for his missing glasses. Instead, he came up with a cigar, which he ended, and lit. 'Why his car, boss?' asked Claude. Cross sighed and used it to blow a plume of smoke. He smiled. 'That's good tobacco'. Claude...' Cross seemed to address the dim light at the end of the cigar. 'If he disappears but his car stays in the drive, it's a bit suspicious, yes?' 'Yes!' agreed the White Mouse, with some glee. 'Yes! Huh?!' 'Take the body up to the Los Angeles reservoir,' added Cross. 'Make sure to dump it from a height.' Claude lifted the corpse and left the garden. 'And you, Mouse,' said Cross. 'Go into the kitchen and find somewhere to write a note. Hollis dropped a newspaper covered in his scrawl over there, on the grass. Copy the writing and write, 'At work. Gone in Early.' ''At Work, have gone in early, yes',' said the White Mouse. 'No- repeat after to me, I don't want it to sound like a Shite-ing Romanian Mouse; 'At work, gone in early'.' The White Mouse repeated this and went into the kitchen. Cross smoked. Sighed. Smoked. It was then that Seymour realised the rain had stopped. The henchman holding the umbrella had not. 'Want a job doing right,' Cross said, around a sigh. 'Sorry, Mr Cross,' said Seymour. Noah Cross dug in his breast pocket and handed Seymour a cigar. 'Not you. You did well. I said you would,' he said. 'Don't smoke it, yet. Go and help that illiterate idiot with the body. I'm going into the house. I won't wake my daughter. I want to watch her sleeping.'' 'Katherine?' asked Seymour. He couldn't help himself. 'Evelyn,' said Cross, in a flat tone, eyes narrowing, body elongating as he drew himself up, as thunderhead cloud does before a storm, Stetson flat-headed, and grey in this light. He grasped Seymour's arm, reminding the skin there just how piscine it was. There was the sharpness of hooks, and Seymour flesh bunched and flopped. Seymour bent his frame around the arm, hunched over, and grabbed at the skin above Cross's contact, but did not dare touch the older man's hand. Cross hissed, 'Just you pay attention to yourself, not her, son. You have a lot to think about, I'd say. Like how your failures brought low our ancestral home.' Cross's claw moved up from the arm to button-hole Seymour. There was no hole for a button there, and no button to go through it, but Cross created one himself, the fabric tearing. 'Like how you couldn't do a simple thing like open a goddamn door. I've seen you doing all this reading, reading, reading. It's giving you ideas above your station. Well, here's a quote for you from your biographer; 'a vast series of raids and arrests occurred, followed by the deliberate burning and dynamiting.... Innsmouth itself was left almost depopulated'... And all because you couldn't open a fucking door.' The claw moved again, now circling Seymour's throat. Seymour wondered if the old man would throttle him and, momentarily whether he would attempt to stop him. 'I'd say I was disappointed in you, Seymour, but the truth is I never expected anything at all. Oh, and never mention Katherine by name. You understand, son? Never.' Letting go of the throat, Cross reached into Seymour's grip of fingers and pulled loose the cigar he had given him. He threw it in the pond. 'Just like you,' he said. 'Wet and limp and useless.' Cross walked away from him, toward the house. He stopped. Didn't bother turning. 'Oh and'' he added. '' find the girl.' [Focus on H.MULWRAY crossed through on crossword answer.] Morty: Gittes!

{"text": "jungle interior. Seymour had been there, searching. 'I've been there,' he said. The owner of the wallet stared at him from the kitchen chair in which she sat. The onion left on the counter was sat cocked at such an angle it might have been listening. On the floor- a floor of tessellating oblongs of lino- lay the food fallen during the struggle before Miss Sessions noticed Seymour's Smile. It ' the Smile ' had worked like a charm. She had become demure. The grocery bag that had contained what was now detritus was itself wet and ruined. Beneath its decayed dome: Cut Rite, cream-wheat, ice cream that had just begun to melt- cream and brown- into itself, and a desultory lettuce which had rolled into the living room. The lettuce lay forlornly as though wondering how it had ended up here, in such a cheap apartment. It had dreamt of spreading its wings, Seymour supposed, Los Angeles wings. Behind the flap of her wallet, was a screen actress card but not very much else, which went to show, Seymour thought, that if you needed to flash the card, you weren't much of an actress. Apart from this, there was a cut-out from that day's Post Record obituary column (coincidentally, Seymour had the same on his bedroom wall) and a two dollar bill. Seymour wondered why this obituary column. The one containing Hollis Mulwray had been two days before. 'I was searching for two people,' said Seymour, of Mexico. The woman seemed more intent on watching his metal Smile than his rubbery lips. Staring at the blade. Glancing at his face. Seymour had left it on the counter at his end of the room. There, the slight curve of metal was an elephant in the kitchen, which, given the apartment's proportions, made it feel very claustrophobic in here. The apartment was nondescript and filled with nondescript ornaments, ornaments not so badly fashioned they defied description, but done with little enough skill that nobody bothered looking in the first place. Seymour would have killed to have those looks. The woman was sweating. Moistened, her nylons smelt like rotting scampi, a smell nostalgic of his home town. Spare pairs hung drying over a bath visible through an adjoining door to the kitchen. Both there and in the kitchen sink could be heard the dripping taps of a landlord not paid enough to care. They lulled Seymour, his head pitching on his hunched shoulders. Drip, drip, d r i p Too little sleep. Too much reading. He blinked. Two women, Seymour would have added, if she were interested. Be a good listener. He felt a pang in his diaphragm and, covering one flabby, webbed, putrid hand with another he rubbed the webbing between his thumb and forefingers on both. This always made him feel better, as though somebody might be inclined to hold his hand. This conversation was awkward. There was no point to it, apart from the one on the kitchenette surface. Realising this, Seymour sighed and leaned back onto the kitchen counter, so that the tyre of fat about his hips overlapped the plastic. Seymour closed the wallet and placed it beside his Smile. 'So,' Seymour said, brightening and standing again as he thought of a way to break the silence. He reached into his valise. The webbing between his fingers caught on the crown of an egg. He scuffed it aside gently, careful not to break the shell. 'I've been reading How to Win Friends and Influence People, by Dale Carnegie,' he drew out the book. It hissed on the fabric of the lining. 'Genius. It's really helped my human skills.' She looked at him longer than she had before, but seemed to miss the knife, and returned her gaze to it. She hadn't looked at him for long when she'd opened the door to her apartment, earlier. He had heard the drip-drip-dripping of her sink taps from outside the kitchenette window and claimed to be a plumber sent by the landlord. After looking, she had invited him in, supposing -he supposed- that Seymour had the look of somebody at home with faeces. It had been easy. You see, thought Seymour, it did help to be a good listener. 'Right now, I'm reading this chapter.' He flapped the book at her, then read, 'If you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive listener. To be interesting, be interested. Ask questions that other persons will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments. Remember that the people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems. A person's toothache means more to that person than a famine in China which kills a million people.' He paused. 'I'm sorry, Miss Sessions, but I'm not interested in you at all, no, not one bit. But you're an actress correct?' She nodded. The action ' torn as ever between his face and his Smile- was sideways, and so more of a shake. 'You had the equity card in your wallet.' He reached over and drew and it out and flashed it. [Picture of card] 'You place yourself in the place of another person, you find such interest in them that you inhabit them, become them. Would you say 'yes'?' She didn't say. Seymour gazed about. He stared through the adjoining door, and recommenced. 'I should like you to animate somebody for me, Miss Sessions, somebody you've animated before. Mrs Mulwray. That's who I'm interested in. Do you see?' She glanced at Seymour, but he wasn't sure she saw much beyond her incipient death. Her eyes were glazed so thoroughly they appeared embalmed. The liquid might have been tears. Seymour reached into his valise, replacing How to Win Friends and Influence People and withdrawing the pen with which he annotated the second green edition. He took the pen to the wallet, jimmying out the", "label": 1}
{"text": "cards before placing them, wrong side up, on the kitchen counter. Writing, he talked. 'I watched your act with the pugnacious Mr Gittes, through the window...' 'Git-tes,' she whispered. 'And what an act it was, cool yet underlit by the passion of a scorned, society wife. If that act had a nail in it, you hammered that nail home, Ms Sessions.' He had finished writing. 'Here are your cues'' Seymour stopped mid reach. 'My, Ms Sessions can I just say what a striking and lovely shade of lipstick that is on your lips.' He hadn't meant to complement. He was on entirely the wrong chapter. As he had stopped mid reach, he also stopped mid-sentence, realising the book was influencing him. The power of the written word, he thought. It flowed through him, he felt, from webbed toes to vestigial dorsal fin, lighting him up as an eel is lit. Exultant, he continued reaching, and speaking, 'A striking shade, yes, but off-setting perfectly the strawberry auburn of your hair, and picking out, giving life to the rusty ochre line in your perfectly complimentary dress.' Her lips, like the fingers of somebody carrying expensive china who becomes suddenly aware they are carrying expensive china, trembled. He could hear her white teeth rattling. Seymour went on. 'The overall effect, and you wouldn't have guessed this, works.' 'Are you going to kill me?' asked Ms Sessions. The trembling was gone, as far as Seymour could see; the glaze cracked. 'I don't want to. Here; take these.' He proffered the cards once more. 'My daddy wants me to.' He shrugged. 'He may not even be my daddy.' She took the cards. Seymour realised he had been wrong. The trembling had not gone. Nodding at the cards, Seymour said. 'It's to help you to be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves. Chapter four... Prompt cards,' he added. She did so, her lips now gone from trembling to a self-revulsed twitching, as though forcing herself to kiss the business end of a wasp. 'It says,' she read. '' Why did you hire me to impersonate Mrs Evelyn Mulwray?' 'We needed Jake Gittes to find Mr Mulwray's alleged mistress, Katherine Cross.' said Seymour. 'Read the next card. And this time, please act interested.' 'Why...' Ida Sessions raised a shaking hand to her lips, as if to settle them. She missed. 'Why do you need Jake Gittes to find Katherine Cross?' 'You're doing very well,' said Seymour. It was a pleasantry. They seemed to come naturally to him, now. Pleased, he placed his hand on hers. There was a momentary squelch as her skin jolted then the shaking stopped. 'Keep going,' he whispered. 'Why do you need to find Katherine Cross?' 'Good lines these aren't they?' said Seymour, appealing to the actress in her. She didn't meet his eyes. She nodded at the rectangular lino. 'We need Katherine Cross because she is pure and a virgin,' answered Seymour. '' and an offspring of the Dagon. We need to sacrifice her on New Year's Eve, so as to bring our God Cthulhu, into a reservoir we aim to build up in the hills, behind a dam wall. We aim to make a home for Him, for our God, in the hills above Los Angeles. You know what they say, this city has a never-ending supply of angels, and Cthulhu, well, He's always hungry.' There was pause in which Ida managed only to sob once. What a pro thought Seymour. Instead of this, he said, softly, 'Last card.' She went on in the same way as the show must. 'Why do you want Cthulhu to come inland into the reservoir you plan to build in the Los Angeles hills?' Seymour sighed. He felt heavy and not all of that was the morbid obesity. Some of it, at least, was the morbidity of the deaths he had caused. 'Because my actions destroyed my home town, and I've been trying to make up for it ever since. Because,' he added so soft she wouldn't be able to hear him. 'I disappoint my father.' She didn't ask for a repetition. 'How do you feel about all this?' he asked. Still looking at the floor, she said, 'I feel sorry for poor Mr Mulwray. I feel sorry for what I've done. I saw it in the newspapers.' Seymour looked at her. He reached out and tilted her chin upwards, leaving a dab of salty slime on its end. She didn't look at him. 'I'm going to kill you,' said Seymour. He reached out and picked up his Smile. She looked at Seymour, now, ignoring the knife. There was a purpose there, he thought. 'What do you want to do before you die?' he asked. 'I want someone to know I didn't mean for Mr Mulwray to get hurt.' 'Who? Who do you want to know?' 'Jake Gittes,' she whispered. She pronounced it 'Git-tes'. Seymour walked to the phone. 'Come on,' he said. 'Come on.' She came. 'Look.' he put a reassuring arm around her, marvelling, as he did, at how comfortable he felt. He didn't blanch at revealing the stink of his armpits, or even squirm at the thought of wiping slimy sweat across her nape. He wasn't coming out of his shell, but had left his shell entirely behind, like a hermit crab who had spotted a bigger and brighter shell to live in. The closeness he now felt was strange and wonderful for a hermit like Seymour. He smiled and said, 'Isn't it good to feel each other's skin? To be so close to another' being.' She didn't reply. His continued. 'You're not in the state to remember his phone number so,' with his Smile he inscribed into the wall above the phone: [number] and [number] 'This is his home number. This is his work. I'll think he'll be at work. Try there.' She nodded, a short, tight action more for herself than Seymour. Her fingers moved more, shaking", "label": 1}
{"text": "as she plucked at the keys. She misdialled twice and Seymour disconnected each of these calls. Then; a voice on the end of the line; 'Git-tes and associates.' Close as their heads were, he could hear the other end, smell Ida's breath. Her mouth smelt like the den of a small and fastidiously clean mammal. He guessed his didn't. 'Jake Git-tes, please,' she said. 'May I ask who's calling?' 'Ida Sessions,' said Ida Sessions. She gulped. 'We've talked before.' 'Hang on.' Silence, into which Seymour said, 'Try to sound confident.' And then, to help with this; 'You're doing very well.' The receptionist was back. 'I'm sorry, he says this is your first contact. Would you like to set up a preliminary meeting?' It came out as 'pre-lime-inary'. Ida breathed, then forced her words out hard on her breath. Pro, thought Seymour again. 'No, we have met before. We have already had a meeting.' 'Hang on.' Breezier. Then, Gittes voice, spat through with the scorn of a working man made good with nobody's help. 'Hello, Miss Sessions. I, uh, don't believe we've had the pleasure.' 'Oh, yes we have. Are you alone?' she asked. 'Isn't everyone?' She started to look at Seymour, but realising he was too close, stared instead at the receiver. Gittes continued, 'Ah, what can I do for you?' 'Well, I'm a working girl. I didn't come to see you on my own.' 'When did you come in?' 'I was the one who pretended to be Mrs Mulwray. Remember?' 'Shut the fuck up.' Gittes was talking to someone else, yet Ida said, 'Beg your pardon?' 'Uh, uh, yes I remember.' 'Beg your pardon?' 'No, I was just checking a detail or two with my associates. Go on.' There were tears on Ida's cheeks, where there hadn't been for her own, incipient demise. 'I didn't expect anything to happen like happened to Mr Mulwray.' A deep breath. 'Point is; if anything ever came out, I want somebody to know that I didn't know what would happen.' 'I understand.' So did Seymour. 'Uh, who was your employer? That could be helpful to both of us.' Ida looked at Seymour, then quickly away. Ida said, with the leanest shake of her head. 'Oh. Oh, no. No.' It perhaps helped both her reticence and the tightness of her action, that Seymour had slipped his Smile up to her face. Gittes went on, 'Uh... What's your address? Maybe we can talk this over?' Ida's tears were on the floor now, along with steadily melting ice cream. The produce looked like a mudslide in a river of milk. Eva said, 'No Mr Gittes just look in the obituary column of LA's Post record.' She twisted away from Seymour. Gittes said something. What- Seymour was unsure. Perhaps only repeating Iva. He reached for the handset, as she said, 'You'll find all these people...' Seymour flinched and pressed the black button, hanging up without hooking the receiver. Eva Sessions allowed the handset to dangle, as she shakily back-peddled across the kitchen, her limbs just as wobbly, just as wiry as the phone's attachment. Her feet squelched and sucked on chocolate. Wobbly, also, was Seymour's pendulous bottom lip and not only because he was breathing heavily. 'I was going to ask you how you wanted to die. Encourage you to talk about yourself. I was feeling strangely... humane.' His eyes hardened if not his rubbery mouth-line. 'But I think you've done enough talking.' She slipped on the milk, her foot scraping an exclamation mark shape all the way into its mud slip. She fell backwards, and Seymour 'following the direction his mood had taken- fell on top of her. Before long, she corpsed, and did so very realistically. Noah Cross and Jake Gittes eat on a veranda in front of a courtyard. They are served a fish dish by Cross's manservant.

Cross laughs. Cross: Tell me: what of the police? Gittes: They're calling it an accident. Cross: Who's the investigating officer? Gittes: Lou Escobar. He's a lieutenant. Cross: You know him?

Exactly what do you know about me? Sit down. Gittes removes his hat, which Cross's man takes, and he sits. Gittes: Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the newspapers. Cross: Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they live long enough.

The holes between the bars over the window above the courtyard looked out on the scuffed-dirt hills and clean-clear sky above Catalina. There were no birds to be seen flying. Seymour presumed this was because they were all sat on their fluffed up arses, shouting. The notes of their cacophony rose sharp in the air as the knife of a killer, or as the scent of this killer. Seymour didn't like to be reminded of the sky when all he dreamt of was the sea, and he turned away from the view, across the wall of his room across which were tacked numerous Post Record excerpts (of criminals, of celebrities, of municipal issues) and sat on his bed next to his book. Seymour had drawn a number of lines between the cuttings. The lines were between the cuttings. None of them connected to either one excerpt or another. This wasn't so much the world view of the Dagon, but their universe view. Things didn't just fall apart; they had always been that way. Without going anywhere near Yeats, Seymour could say this with the deepest certainty. He was, after all, one of those slouching, rough beats. Below, at the edge of the courtyard, he knew Cross and Gittes were talking, though Seymour couldn't hear them. He opened How to Win Friends and Influence People, and read, 'Everyone who was ever a guest of Theodore Roosevelt was astonished at the range and diversity of his knowledge. Whether his visitor was a cowboy or a Rough Rider, a New York politician or a diplomat, Roosevelt knew what to say. And how was it done? The answer was simple. Whenever Roosevelt expected a visitor, he sat up late the night before, reading up on the subject in which he knew his guest was particularly interested. For Roosevelt knew, as all leaders know, that the royal road to a person's heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.' Seymour looked up from How to Win Friends and Influence People. The birds had been interrupted by a whinnying that went beyond the bursts normally heard from the stables around the courtyard. Accompanying the clipping, the clopping, and the neighing, was the sound of a band: guitars, violins, a guitardon, rising high into the afternoon's bluff and blue. The sheriff's gold posse. The chords of their music intertwined and rose and met in a way the birds' did not. Seymour's pupils rose to the top of his slitted eyes, as though he could watch the notes rise. When he had opened his hardback, he had bent his hunched back further to allow his moist nose to touch the page. There was something about the book, the smell of glue or the lean undercurrent of paper, the nasal equivalent of the undertow of a crisp, cold source of a mountain river. Reassurance was not in the Dagon dictionary. Reading, and reading this book, in particular, gave the impression that the world made sense, that it all came together in a way in which his wall didn't. He itched at the scabby scales of his forehead, accidentally culling a rough irregular pentagon of skin. Wiping it on his bed-sheet, he retrieved a pen from his valise and uncapped it. Poised above the book, he prepared to underline a word, or asterix a point, but instead, he moved the pen to the Word of Cross crossword and stared at [Leroy's number]. [This section of the crossword] Then, methodologically, he crossed out Ida Sessions. [A wider view including Ida's name] After this, he retrieved How to Win Friends and Influence People and held the nib over the margin. Then ' beside the lines and below the chapters- he began to write, in human only where he wrote in Spanish, and the rest in Dagon, his first tongue, those ' noises swelled to a bestial babel of croaking, baying, and barking without the least suggestion of human speech 'immortalised by the man Seymour made all the more mortal, by murdering him.

{"text": "no other way. 6. Bernard Shaw once remarked: \"If you teach a man anything, he will never learn.\" Shaw was right. Learning is an active process. Only knowledge that is used sticks in your mind. You are attempting to form new habits. Ah yes, you are attempting a new way of life. That will require time and persistence and daily application. 7. Offer your spouse, your child or some business associate a dime or a dollar every time he or she catches you violating a certain principle. Make a lively game out of mastering these rules. Later, Seymour would cross out the last word of the first point and replace it with 'humans'. He would then draw four stars after the fourth point. The sign above the stage read, 'Le Grande Midgetian' with vowels accented with a star, the whole underlined by three wands. The Midgetian stood on the stage. Seymour stared at him. 'Avalon,' said the Midgetian, stretching out a hand that was flat but for the slight heaving of the deck of the SS Catalina. 'Avalon... our destination. In Arthurian legend'' In his accent, it was 'leg end'. The Midgetian started at seeing Seymour and stared at him in return. Seymour had little experience with human midgets and none with those coated in a bright red jacket and booted in the same shiny black as their tall hat. By the pause and the disgust in the Midgetian's eye, the midget had not previously seen a him. Le Grande Midgetian restarted. 'In Arthurian legend, Avalon... Avalon - it is the island of Arthur's court. The isle where everything grows, and is there to pluck for free, the isle of plenty ' filled with apple trees begging for a plucking. And on that island, anything you take, any pommes, they grow back straight away, and sometimes ' yes - by magic. ' On the stage beside the Midgetian was a wooden table and on this a metal box the height of his head, if the black top hat was included. Above and beyond the stage, the SS Catalina's black funnel rose into the blue sky as if a thumb hitching a lift from heaven. 'More pommes than you can eat.' The Midgetian turned his hand to indicate the box. 'Apples that magically reappeared as soon as they were plucked from the bountiful bosom of Mother Nature.' Le Grande Midgetian leaped down from the stage. The Midgetian approached a woman with skin as grey as her crinoline skirt, corduroy jacket, and tied-back bobbed hair, each material as wrinkled as the others. 'An apple from here,' he said. She shrank back and down as he reached forward and magically produced both an apple and the pretence of a bosom to pluck it from. The crowd laughed. The spinster didn't. The Midgetian held the apple aloft. It was small, browned, wrinkled. 'And then again...' said Le Grand Midgetian, moving in a twinkle of cabin-lanterns on a matt black hat, 'from here.' He was at another woman now, eyes to chest. To say she was blessed in the bosom department was to skip over just how lucky her husband was, thought Seymour. '' from here.' With a melodramatic pluck at her cleavage he produced a large, red, ripe apple. As a cooking apple, it would have yielded enough plush white flesh for a small pie, all of its own. More laughter, which washed up the midget who went again bobbing to the stage, and up-up-upon it, whereupon he placed the two apples within the metal box. The greyed, lined spinster watched him as he went by, and measured the difference between the two apples, as had the crowd. If it were possible, she seemed less amused than when she hadn't laughed. 'This,' Le Grande Midgetian announced of the metal box, '' is a safe, a standard safe found in any large house or Mexican style casa, or Faux Texan ranch up in the Gods of the hills above Los Angeles. Movie stars have these safes, moguls, council leaders.' The table turned as Le Grande Midgetian spun it. 'As with any safe you expect it to keep things, safe, no? Mais qui?' Seymour misheard, thinking the Midgetian had said, 'Maybe' because he had now reopened the doors, and one apple was gone. The wilted, unloved apple remained, and Seymour did not know why anyone would want to, but a small bite had been taken from it. The crowd gasped. Le Grande Magician whirled, red tails of his jacket fluttering, as he said, 'But if your juiciest favourite apples have disappeared from your eye' then bluh, la, buh yub men.' Le Grande Midgetian, to a further gasp from the crowd, pulled the bite of apple from his mouth. That, thought Seymour, explained the bite's size. The Midgetian spat it to the deck. 'And where!' he declared more than asked, 'Where!' He jumped once more from the stage. 'Where has the juicy, forbidden fruit gone?' He stopped before the well-breasted lady who was already laughing so hard her breasts were joining in. The Midgetian bobbed a hand up into the air, a small claw that hovered as might a small bird on the right crosswind. His eyes narrowed, seeds once more. 'But to be sure madam,' he said. 'This one is the apple of my eye.' There it is, thought Seymour of the idiom. And it was. With a heave at his eye socket, the great magician produced the missing apple. With a bow, he presented the apple back to the woman, whose skin had gone the colour of its skin. The crowd clapped and began to do what they had begun to do (unconsciously) around Seymour; to disperse. 'I did not appreciate your little show,' said a voice. It had its own accent. Old and rich. The spinster. The crowd began to draw back in. 'Encore,' someone shouted. 'I do not appreciate your little joke at my expense.' The midget smiled. The slick moustache above and", "label": 1}
{"text": "the concrete support read, 'Vic con safo' in long letters, their peaks hidden in the shadows above, under the bridge. The first word, the highest, was visible as two diagonal stokes, a vertical line, and a curve. It was only visible because of the light that crinkled out from the fire below the bridge, beside the bureau dresser. I know what the letters read, in full, because I'd visited this underpass five times before, and each time I'd been unable to murder him. I knew Spanish well enough to reply to the writing because I'd chased Mrs Evelyn Cross Mulwray and her daughter deep south, to Cancun and deeper to Playa Del Carmen- to its blue bay so unlike in hue to my home- and into the interior, into places where they still spoke languages spoken before the Spanish. Not as old as mine, no; that tongue was spoken before the humans. Vic con safo. 'Evantarse usted bastardo perezoso.' I said, though this time to myself. I had fallen on the scree slope leading down below the bridge. It was dark, the gravel loose, and because I was as much an embarrassment to myself as to the man who might as well be my father, Noah Cross. I rose and scrambled down the slope to the lick of mud the cartographers called 'L.A. River', my left hand on the slope, my right arm plane-winging out. The fall had ripped my pants. I felt cooler there (I walk like a stuffed penguin, and the action of my gait airs my legs) cooler than the clammy grip of the rest of my skin. I closed on this mark, and said, 'Good evening, Mr Shudarht.' The man was bent over the bureau dresser scribbling furiously with what could have been a pen but was on the other side of him and so unseen. He raised his other finger, 'Call me Leroy. I haven't been Mr Shudarht since I quit cleaning my underwear.' Though Leroy would have been unable to see it, and it could not have befriended him or influenced him in any way, I smiled. 'Leroy,' I said 'How are the drawings?' 'A smear of cunt dribble from a harridan's after-sex,' said Leroy, casting a crumpled ball into the fire that burnt in a ring of loose riverbed rocks. Without the flames, in the daytime, they would have been as dry as the riverbed. Now, charred and in the dark, I only knew them by their silhouette. I had seen them before ' the drawings. Tentacles of a submarine beast penetrating a young woman; her vagina appeared riven. There were heavy ink droplets at the crest of her fluted thighs, as though Leroy had broken his pen in the fervour of his art, and rabidly dribbled the stains on. The expression on her face was equally violated (a hole for the mouth, expression both penetrating and penetrated) an emotion that had never been there before, and didn't know what to make of itself. Below her feet; a face I knew well peered up through what could only be depths. Lots of eyes. The ancient one. The bureau was packed with sheaves depicting the same scene. Leroy had seen it in a dream, three years before, and couldn't stop drawing the vista. Three years ago he had been a lawyer, but judges took dimly to such imagery scrawled over transcripts, graffitied on the back of court benches. 'Good one?' 'Close.' He was drawing again, now on the back of a label he had peeled from the bourbon bottle he drank from. 'Still reading from the book, Seymour?' I looked below the bridge and into the darkness of the valley. 'Yeah,' I said. On the valley floor was a sign advertising office space for let. It lay, wind-scrubbed until its phone number could no longer be seen. 'How's that going?' 'Okay.' My Smile was heavy in my jacket pocket, causing my spirits and face to fall. I knew what was to follow. I looked down. I shifted on my feet. 'Sometimes I feel like' I don't know, like people could like me, like it could work.' 'Sure people could like you.' Scratch, draw, crumple, throw paper on the fire. A smile of Leroy's own. 'You're a likeable kind of guy Seymour, and I should know; I've had to put up with you for five nights. Wanna drink?' I shook my head. Leroy didn't stop to see the rebuttal. 'I'm on this chapter now,' I said. '' where you've got to try to talk 'in the terms' of somebody else's interests. You know; like for yourself, I'd talk to you about these drawings you can't stop drawing. You know; ask all about them, why you do them what they are, what they mean.' 'So, I don't mind talking about that at all, Seymour,' said Leroy, drinking with his left hand, sketching with his right. '' as long as you don't mind me illustrating all my points.' I smiled again. 'No, it's okay. I know the answers to all those questions.' 'How so? We haven't talked about them, not in the nights and afternoons you've visited. Now, this is the lawyer in me speaking, Seymour, and it may be a soused lawyer, but a lawyers always a lawyers no matter how much they've had to drink. That's why we're hated at parties. Well, one of the reasons. So, Seymour, how'd you know all these answers, 'cause I'm damn sure I don't remember giving them.' 'The pictures are things you saw in a dream three years ago. You haven't been able to stop dreaming them. They are of a great ancient creature in the depths of the Pacific Ocean. It was woken by the earthquake that happened that night three years ago when you started dreaming of it. This creature, this thing you don't know what it's called, but I do. It's Cthulhu.

{"text": "offspring. I know who the woman is, also. She will die in childbirth. Her name's Katherine, and I think I'm in love with her.' 'Shit, said Leroy. He waved a dismissive left hand. 'No, not what you're saying; that last drawing.' It was already burning. 'Now this is the lawyer in me again.' He was scratching out an image in the dirt beside the river bank, now, as he did whenever he ran out of canvasses. 'But you answered the what, but not the how, which was my question, eh?' 'How? I know what you're doing because it's my job to find people like you. My boss, my father... maybe, my brother... he has given me a list of people who need to die, who are telling the world before about the coming of Cthulhu we are ready or who are just plain in the way. I call it the Cross Word because' well, it's boring... That's how I know.' Momentarily, Leroy Shudarht paused in his scratching. Dust hung before the flames. His face, even in profile before the red and oranges of the fire, seemed to relax. 'I wouldn't mind that.' He said, and went back to sketching in the dirt. I looked away, changed the subject. 'I thought you said water comes down here. Won't it wash away your drawings in the dirt?' Leroy nodded. 'Yes, but I can't stop,' he said. 'B'' 'Shhhh,' said Leroy. 'Can't you hear it?' 'What?' 'The flood.' Leroy walked, and I saw that the only thing sure and sober about the vagrant was his artistic fingers. Not thin, nor delicate digits, but forever engaged in art, fat, in fact rigoured, crooked from their constant application, the right hand on creation, the left on the throat of a bottle. (Plactise maches plurfect, as any alcoholic will tell you.) He reached the centre of the 'river' which extended as a spit of mud in the otherwise dry valley. He lay, pressed his face to the earth. 'It's coming again!' he said. Even as he did so, he drank and drew. I frowned, an action that bent my head forward and down. I could hear it. A rush tenuous as a cool swing beat played a mile away in a club in this stultifying heat, as tickling on the ears as the end of a tentacle. It took a moment for my ears to be sure. Water. 'Leroy'' I said. Leroy nodded into the silt, still drawing. The water came, then, as it does here every night at this time; in a flood, and submerged him. Leroy did not move, his hand clutched, Seymour guessed, around the impression of a tentacle. Leroy clung onto his art. Still, he couldn't stop drawing the nameless thing. I staggered forward. In the dark and the water, I could make out only the back of Leroy, and an elbow, abdomen raised as if attempting half a press up. 'Leroy'.' I had been sent here to kill, but I couldn't just watch him die. I reached out. Leroy's right arm stilled. It was the last part of him to do so. I waded forward. The water was running off, leaving the vagrant like a dead fish at low tide. Leroy smelt rotten already. Death hadn't changed that. The centre on the valley below the bridge gurgled, becoming once more. I flipped Leroy, I sat astride him, leant forward, slapped him, shook him, took a suckering ragged breath, tilted my awkward frame to pin my rubbery lips like the outer rim of a tyre around Leroy's. My tongue, too long for my mouth, flapped down and accidentally frenched the dead man. I huffed breath and my gills whistled. I withdrew my face, and water sumped left, over the dysenteric paddy field of Leroy's unshaven cheek, down the slope, and gurgled away with the rest in the mud. No water spat straight up, no breath, nor any spark of light came to Leroy's eyes. The fire the vagrant had set was burning low and I rose. I walked toward the edge of the bridge. It is possible I wept, but I didn't know anybody who could be bothered to verify this, and it was dark besides, too dark to tell.' The door opened. Cross strode in. In this mood, Seymour knew, he had no need of his staff. He walked to the bed and knocked Seymour from it with a punch to the temple. 'Gittes knows,' he shouted. Seymour didn't ask what he knew. Seymour knew the answer. Dam, he thought. Cross skirted the bed and grabbed up How to Win Friends and Influence People. 'Do you actually pay any attention to this?' he threw the book against the wall of newspaper cuttings. How to Win Friends and Influence People connected with the wall at a line of tacks and fell to the floor in a cantrip-like scatter of pins, and then a flutter of displaced clippings. Cross continued, 'If you were paying attention you'd realise your reading this book is no accident. Who sent you to that bloody theatre, boy? Even when how to succeed is written in black and white and human, you still fucking fail, eh?' Cross drew his chin in and his head up. Momentarily, Seymour thought he would be kicked, but didn't dare roll into a ball. Instead, Cross breathed until the sound of it evened out. He then said in a voice just as even, 'I've put Mulverhille on the gumshoe. Our man Duffy's no good when Gittes has gone out on his own. He's figured out what we're doing up in the orange groves, up in the hills. I don't know how. Mulverhille will tell the police when Gittes finds Katherine. I've got a lieutenant there in my pocket. ... Seymour; you gotta find my girl first.' Seymour nodded. Cross was a creature of deep, uncertain tides, shifting personalities and sudden abysses.

{"text": "one who did the staggering, after them. It was best to agree. Cross smiled. 'You've done well, son. Hollis Mulwray. That was a scalp. Ida Sessions. Who was that tramp? Leroy Shoe-heart.' (Shudarht, thought Seymour.) 'But the girl... Of all the names I gave you- hers is the most important. The girl. Her sex. The scent of her will bring Him in.' Still, Cross stood there, evenly breathing. This time, though, the air came mostly through the nose, as if he were sniffing. Seymour, with nothing better to do, just nodded. [In white font on black, with the black clouded and smoky at the edges] His hair had been blonde until the age of ten when it had turned, as fallen autumnal leaves turn, to rotten brown, and then seemed to rot away entirely, leaving a scaled, grey pate. His hair when he was six caught the sun and was burnished as he ran excitedly up and down the beaches off the mouth of the River Inn, where sand collected before the salivac maw of its coastal estuary. His hair bounced as he ran and his two pale young hands twisting in the air above it as though they looked as he did for gifts borne in by a sea that shimmered as bright as his hair under the same sun. Watching him, his Grandmother tutted and shook her grey sharp-teethed head. (Later, when he was a teenager, she would do the same for all his word games, for all his human puns, seedy sniggers at the human words 'hard', 'big' or 'throbbing', for all his hormone driven jokes.) A mirage, maybe, but the air above the sea wavered over his mother. He knew she was out there. She returned to him, to this bit of beach, periodically, and sent him in shells from the deeps. Seymour would pretend to play out deeper and deeper in the shallows and picked from the breakers just as they fell before their long trek up the sand. There, she sent swirling the first homes of hermit crabs, the flecked, Fibonacci curved carapaces of sea snails and the shells of turtles. Grandmother (who may have been a great auntie anyway) didn't know what he was doing, and wouldn't have believed him, besides. But once, in the height of summer, he saw, borne by a wave before it broke, his mother, until he realised it was too small - and as it got closer - far too small, but was a doll in the image of her woven from sea weed, with bleached fronds for the hair. He would wonder how she had knitted such a delicate piece until he realised that was what tentacles did, they thinned until they reached the narrowest, most nimble end; that delicacy was their finest point. He had kept that doll in his room until it stank and was noticed by Grandmother, even in Innsmouth. He had buried it on the cliff nearest the sea. Gittes: That dam's a con job. Mrs Mulwray: What dam? Gittes: The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it. 6 - How To Make People Like You Instantly Let's take another illustration. Hall Caine's novels-The Christian, The Deemster, The Manxman, among them - were all best-sellers in the early part of this century. Millions of people read his novels, countless millions. He was the son of a blacksmith. He never had more than eight years' schooling in his life; yet when he died he was the richest literary man of his time. The story goes like this: Hall Caine loved sonnets and ballads; so he devoured all of Dante Gabriel Rossetti's poetry. He even wrote a lecture chanting the praises of Rossetti's artistic achievement-and sent a copy to Rossetti himself. Rossetti was delighted. \"Any young man who has such an exalted opinion of my ability,\" Rossetti probably said to himself, \"must be brilliant,\" So Rossetti invited this blacksmith's son to come to London and act as his secretary. That was the turning point in Hall Caine's life; for, in his new position, he met the literary artists of the day. Profiting by their advice and inspired by their encouragement, he launched upon a career that emblazoned his name across the sky. BANG. BAng. bang 'Bull's eye,' sad Loach, lowering the weapon and raising his stance. Loach was the kind of man, thought Seymour, who suited being shorter than other men. 'Wow,' said Seymour. The jazz-like percussion of after shot in his ears made the words sound insincere. 'Not a Bull's eye but a third eye, a Cyclopean eye?' 'Eh?' said Loach walking toward the target. The centre of the silhouette forehead had been blown out in a crater of ripped paper. Not stopping for Seymour's answer he ripped it off its pegs and nodded to himself. 'Gave him a bigger eye. Right between the other two, eh!' He showed it. Seymour nodded in what he hoped was an enthusiastic way. 'Looks like a her, not a him,' he said. 'Eh?' This time Loach looked up. 'Look, your other two shots hit the hips, gave him a skirt.' Loach looked. He reddened, a colour at odds with his habitual grey. 'You sure did hobble him first,' said Seymour. 'Bang bang, hip-hip, stop him walking away, bang, gave him a newer bigger eye. Bang, gave him a skirt.' Loach nodded, a nod slow enough for him to be convinced that this had been aim, by the time he finished nodding. 'Sure. Sure. Made him my bitch.' He laughed, short and ugly. Like the rest of him, thought Seymour. 'How'd you get those big rips in the paper?' Loach smiled. 'It's a .45, right, on any Joe that'd open up his skin real good.' Loach walked toward Seymour, tilting the target. 'See, I tilt it on the pegs. See?' Seymour did. 'That'r way it gives the same impact as on good honest flesh. Really tears it up, right?' Seymour nodded, just as slow as", "label": 1}
{"text": "Loach had before. 'I've got to say, not many people would have thought of that Detective Loach. You do have a real imagination for this kind of thing. A skill. Bet you're quite the shooter out on the street.' His laugh drew out, the syllables of it separating, then finally dispersing fully. 'Yeah, I haven't had the chance really, Igor, right?' Seymour didn't get a chance to say, 'Yes.' Loach was continuing. 'I'll get it though, Igor, feel it in my bones. Gonna take down a big criminal one of these days. Big as 'Two Gun' Crowley, maybe's- maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow. Bang.' He poked a finger in an out of the third eye, before wrapping his well-spaced fingers around the paper, twisting it until it crumpled, and throwing it in a bin of targets beside the stairs to the shooting range. In there, the targets had the look of a mass burial for shadows. It was the kind of image his daddy wouldn't have stood for. That's all I am- Daddy's shadow. Stand where he makes a stand, walk where he walks, go where he points. When he dies, I won't be anything. He probably isn't even my daddy. 'You following?' asked Loach. He was on the steps to the ground level. Beside them, beside the stairs, forearms lay around in a heap. 'Lots of guns,' Seymour said, picking up his valise. He felt safer with his valise. Loach flapped at it, saying off-handedly, 'Yeah, we need a new gun locker.' They ascended, Seymour following, his fingers clipping upwards and downwards on the sturdily built bannister. Since he had been reading 'How to Win Friends and Influence Humans', Seymour noticed, he no longer followed the grain. Loach opened a door inscribed with 7[backward]01 EGNAR NUG ad walked out into a marble floored corridor with thick crimson lines at its sides, as though the blood from the door there (103 CORONER) had seeped through. The walls were off white and veined vaguely grey. Week dead skin, thought Seymour, automatically. There were two sets of translucent double doors at the corridor's end, leading out to a day made grey both by their ribbed transparency, and by the earliness of the hour. 'This way,' said Loach. The slight nod of his head said the same. They left the corridor by a door marked '101 DETECTIVES' and entered an office. The room contained not only the ABC of administration but its A-Z: calendars frog-spawned with thick ink circles, paintings not composed so badly they caused the gaze to wince, nor well enough to hold it, tables and memos pinned to boards whose instructions which were just out of the range of eyesight. Beyond this: black filling cabinets like obsidian monoliths, brass lamps burnished until they shone dimly (but still brighter than their bulbs) dark wood desks, men who couldn't raise enough energy to do more than chew, or scribble; each and every man moving no more than one muscle at one time. It was all men. Loach flicked a finger at a spare desk. 'Can I use the phone?' asked Seymour as he sat and placed his valise beside him, on the floor. Loach looked at him. There was a question in his eyes 'Whitey?' (followed by 'at the Times?') that his pride could not quite allow him to ask. 'Sure,' he said in its stead. Loach walked to the other room. To Lieutenant Escobar's desk. The Lieutenant was talking to a thick set man Seymour did not recognise. He would have to add to his cuttings. From these, he recalled the police department's phone number. Seymour picked up the phone at the spare desk and dialled. 'Los Angeles Police Department,' said a female human. 'Lieutenant Escobar, please,' he said. 'Hang on,' said the female human. Escobar's phone rang. The lieutenant ignored it, talking to the thick set man, ignoring Loach, who had begun to jostle on his feet as though a child waiting to ask a teacher to go to the toilet. The phone rang, a muted intrusion over the low, cicada drone of the office. 'I'm sorry,' said the female human on the line. 'He's not at his desk.' 'I know you're probably very busy,' said Seymour. 'People are trying to get hold of you all the time, no doubt. But this is really important to me. Will you please try again?' The next words fell right out, like a smile that couldn't help itself. 'Why, of course.' The phone rang. The lieutenant picked it up. 'Lieutenant Escobar.' the first word had a heft to it, as though a recently won trophy, often picked up and more often admired, given a little shine every time. 'A woman has been killed,' said Seymour. 'Apartment 8, 4, 8 and a half, East Kensington, Echo Park.' 'Yeah,' Escobar was chewing something he hadn't been before picking up the phone. There was no food on his desk. 'And how do I know that?' 'She knows Jake Gittes,' said Seymour. Loach had begun talking, leaning over the lieutenant's desk. 'Back up and shut the fuck up,' said the lieutenant. Loach did so. 'She's up to her lungs in the Mulwray case,' added Seymour, hanging up. He picked up the receiver once more as the Lieutenant rose from his desk, pointing at Loach. With the receiver pressed to his ear, what Escobar said next was muted but Seymour could tell they were orders. Seymour dialled the number he had scratched into Ida Session's kitchen wall, for Jack Gittes' home. It rang for some time before there was the click and silence of a phone being picked up but not answered. 'Gittes'' said Seymour, watching Escobar and Loach. He repeated, '' Gittes.' '' Yeah.' It was Gittes. 'Ida Sessions wants to see you,' said Seymour. He remembered her eyes the last time he ' Seymour - had seen her. Unseeing. 'Who?' 'Ida Sessions. You remember Ida.' Her eyes. 'Yeah, I do?' drawled Gittes, his voice a dark smear", "label": 1}
{"text": "of cynicism. 'Sure you do.' 'I tell you what, pal,' said Gittes. (Pal! thought Seymour excitedly. Twice in one week!) 'If Ida wants to see me, she can call me at my office.' Gittes hung up. Both Loach and Escobar were getting ready to leave. There was a glowering, gloaming intensity to the lieutenant, like that in an anvil-headed storm cloud as it lit up. The fingers of Detective Loach fluttered as though he were a leaf before it. Quickly, Seymour dialled again. He had to get Gittes and the police there, at Ida's apartment, at the same time. Then, Gittes would lead them all to Katherine. Seymour was sure of it. Gittes answered. Loach was walking toward Seymour. Seymour didn't know what to say so went with the relevant factual information. 'Eight, four,' he said. 'Eight and a half, East Kensington, Echo Park. She begged me to call. She's waiting for you.' Seymour hung up. Loach had reached his desk. 'Important call?' said Loach. Seymour smiled. Loach said, 'Gotta go...' 'Can I ride along in your car?' Loach cast a glance at Escobar. Not his car, not his choice, didn't want to show either, so he said, 'Yeah, no wor-worries,' in a weak, wavering voice shot through with the slightest of stammers. They went out of the office door, along the corridor and out by the two sets of double doors into the low, grey day. They walked to a shiny black car with a beetled-brow roof, and low set, glowering windows like eyes on an angry face, on Escobar's face. 'Who the fuck?' said Escobar, loudly. Loach lent and whispered close to the lieutenant's ear. The title 'LA Times' drifted across to Seymour. 'I haven't got time for this,' said Escobar. 'Get in.' Seymour sat in the back, placing the valise on his lap, stroking it gently as if it were a black, furless, taxidermised cat. Loach and Escobar sat in the front. The back seats were plush; ribbed with soft cushioning. Before he gunned the engine, Escobar turned to him and said. 'Anyone ever told you; you smell of fish?' Seymour smiled and said, 'No, but I've been told I smell of human once before.' Escobar looked like he might smile at this, but didn't. Particularly after I gut one, added Seymour, internally. The lieutenant's nose wrinkled. 'Just don't get anything on the seats. They're new this Wednesday.' He drove to Echo Park. They parked around the corner from a pair of cheap looking, squat, oblong apartments, spiked at their front garden by the sharp petals and leaves of tropical plants. Ida Sessions was the one on the right. The sun had now risen and stretched out a hand and slapped the world, pinking the white-washed, Spanish-style houses of Echo Park. 'Wait here,' said Loach. His accent sounded a little like Escobar's as he gave the command. The police officers went round to the boot, opened it, removed two torches then left the car and walked to the aperture between the apartments ' and between the uneven topiary- then disappeared inside. A few minutes later, a moustached police man flat-footed by, and entered the same gap. Some minutes after this a long, sleek Cadillac parked, and Jake Gittes got out. He went in the same way. Seymour waited and while he waited, he reached into the valise and pulled out How to Win Friends and Influence People. Behind the text, as he retrieved it, Seymour saw other titles nestled in the bag's leathered, comfortable, bookish shade. Not full titles, but fragments visible behind other books. 'Leaves' and a 'Letter' and, irritatingly thick, a 'Dick'. Guiltily, he shut the valise with a 'click' and read. You Can't Win An Argument I was attending a banquet one night given in Sir Ross's honor; and during the dinner, the man sitting next to me told a humorous story which hinged on the quotation \"There's a divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we will.\" The raconteur mentioned that the quotation was from the Bible. He was wrong. I knew that, I knew it positively. There couldn't be the slightest doubt about it. And so, to get a feeling of importance and display my superiority, I appointed myself as an unsolicited and unwelcome committee of one to correct him. He stuck to his guns. What? From Shakespeare? Impossible! Absurd! That quotation was from the Bible. And he knew it. The storyteller was sitting on my right; and Frank Gammond, an old friend of mine, was seated at my left. Mr. Gammond had devoted years to the study of Shakespeare, So the storyteller and I agreed to submit the question to Mr. Gammond. Mr. Gammond listened, kicked me under the table, and then said: \"Dale, you are wrong. The gentleman is right. It is from the Bible.\" On our way home that night, I said to Mr. Gammond: \"Frank, you knew that quotation was from Shakespeare,\" \"Yes, of course,\" he replied, \"Hamlet, Act Five, Scene Two. But we were guests at a festive occasion, my dear Dale. Why prove to a man he is wrong? Is that going to make him like you? Why not let him save his face? He didn't ask for your opinion. He didn't want it. Why argue with him? Always avoid the acute angle.\" The man who said that taught me a lesson I'll never forget. I not only had made the storyteller uncomfortable, but had put my friend in an embarrassing situation. How much better it would have been had I not become argumentative. Jack Gittes left Ida Sessions apartment, followed by the two detectives and the patrolman. Gittes went to his car, climbed in, gunned the engine and drove down the road toward the coast. Escobar and Loach and the flatfoot returned to the car Seymour sat in, and the patrolman climbed laboriously into the backseat, sitting beside Seymour. The axles of the car sank at its back under their combined weight. The patrolman", "label": 1}
{"text": "was long in the body, and in the lengths of his legs, and just as long - relative to his lips - in the moustache. His eyes were as dark, and the hairs on his upper lip as bristly, as his humour; his disposition as pitch as his jackboots were polished. He did not smile or speak to Seymour as the detectives threw their torches back into the boot, nor while the lieutenant drove the car after Gittes, arriving, some ten minutes later, at the coast. Gittes was waiting where the road ended and the endless blue sea began, endless as it seemed to stretch into the equally blue sky, against which Gittes was a sharp-suited silhouette. The three policemen stepped out of the car and followed the private investigator to the cliff, and then in jolting zigzags downward, and out of Seymour's view. He reopened the book. It was a sorely needed lesson because I had been an inveterate arguer. During my youth, I had argued with my brother about everything under the Milky Way. When I went to college, I studied logic and argumentation and went in for debating contests. Talk about being from Missouri, I was born there. I had to be shown. Later, I taught debating and argumentation in New York; and once, I am ashamed to admit, I planned to write a book on the subject. Since then, I have listened to, engaged in, and watched the effect of thousands of arguments. As a result of all this, I have come to the conclusion that there is only one way under high heaven to get the best of an argument - and that is to avoid it. Avoid it as you would avoid rattlesnakes and earthquakes. Nine times out of ten, an argument ends with each of the contestants more firmly convinced than ever that he is absolutely right. You can't win an argument. You can't because if you lose it, you lose it; and if you win it, you lose it. Why? Well, suppose you triumph over the other man and shoot his argument full of holes and prove that he is non compos mentis. Then what? You will feel fine. But what about him? You have made him feel inferior. You have hurt his pride. He will resent your triumph. And - A man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still. '' trust him,' said Loach as he opened the car door. Seymour realised the sentence had been turned up at its end like a question, and mentally added the question mark. Lieutenant Escobar sat in the driver's seat. 'I don't trust him, but if he wants to keep his license, he'll find Mrs Mulwray.' He turned the ignition. 'Gittes has got water on the brain. All that nonsense about the City running water out into the sea on purpose, and in a drought. No. She's a murder suspect, now. I don't care what that broad is like in bed, there's no way Gittes loses his license and goes back to what he was doing before. He hated Chinatown. He'll forget about the bloody water and lead us right to her. Then I have a phone call to make'' Escobar said this last almost to himself but Seymour knew the area code that began that number. It would be the Island of Catalina. The lieutenant tilted his head backward but did not turn to look in Seymour. 'And in the meantime we get back to the station and get this stink out of the car. I don't care what paper he writes for, he smells like we'll need toilet paper to get him off the seats.' In order to avoid an argument, Seymour returned to reading, He continued until they stopped and all got out. The patrolman, then Seymour, with Escobar watching down his beak-like nose as he did so, as a vulture might weigh the cost/benefits of a diseased corpse. By the time he had both raised and squeezed his frame from sitting to standing on the sidewalk, the patrolman had walked, his legs carrying him quickly away. 'I'll just go file this,' said Seymour, flapping his notepad. The detectives were walking away, toward their station, Escobar uncaring, Loach beside him, seeming to copy the lieutenant's indifference alongside the way he walked. Both looked like a stretch. As the detectives passed through the twin double doors, Seymour doubled back, returning to the car. Where the detectives went, this afternoon, was where Katherine Cross would be found, he knew from their conversation. The threads of his life were coming together in a manner which, were Seymour still thinking like a Dagon, would have perturbed him. (It would have perturbed him more, of course, if he had realised he was no longer thinking like a Dagon.) He circled to the boot, hitched open its door, placed his valise beside a small pile of bags to the right of the compartment, moved one torch so that he would not lie on it, and picked up the other. He got in, lay down, and closed the hatch. Clicking on the torch, he read, again. After a while, despite the uneven flooring, he fell asleep. Too many late nights, too much murdering. Even an ugly, odd fish like him needed some beauty sleep. As wise old Ben Franklin used to say: If you argue and rankle and contradict, you may achieve a victory sometimes; but it will be an empty victory because you will never get your opponent's good will. So figure it out for yourself. Which would you rather have, an academic, theatrical victory or a person's good will? You can seldom have both. Distrust your first instinctive impression. Our first natural reaction in a disagreeable situation is to be defensive. Be careful. Keep calm and watch out for your first reaction. It may be you at your worst, not your best. Control your temper. Remember, you can measure the size of a", "label": 1}

There was a second, weaker bang. Loach, a blinking Seymour guessed. He was staring directly into the torch, and shifted its beam. The engine ignited and the car jolted to a start. 'So I see the stinks still in the back seat,' Escobar said. 'I think we'll have to torch the car to get it out. It will be like frying a fish.' Loach laughed longer than he should. 'Well,' said the lieutenant, 'I guess it's the day for Stink, ain't it? It's like the play, Hamlet, there's something rotten in L.A. Tonight, something rotten in Echo Park, eh? Wouldn't you say?' When Loach didn't, Escobar added. '\"There's a divinity that shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we will.\" and all that. I feel like we're those two actors, you know, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, just squeezing in and out of a bigger play. I just can't see the edges of it.' Escobar said. 'I've had a tip off that Mrs Mulwray definitely did it, did in her husband. Not sure if I believe it, but you believe a tip from somebody that big, you don't have any choice but believe.' Seymour could barely hear him, and pressed his ear to the back of the backseats. Escobar spoke quietly, as if to no-one in particular, which is perhaps how he saw Loach, but then he asked, 'Don't you think?' Loach clearly didn't do this either, from the pause that followed, or from the inanity of his final reply; 'It's Chinatown.' Seymour could almost hear the shrug. Through the gaps of the boot's rims, Seymour could see flashes of the traffic, and dazzles of Chinatown. If the car lights were baubles, Chinatown was the full Christmas tree. Fluorescent lines of light and luminous segments of Chinese letters zigged somehow around the boot's metal innards. 'There's Mrs Mulwray's car,' said Escobar. 'And Gittes men.' There was the sound of them getting out, and of Loach again trying to slam his side as hard as Escobar normally did. Escobar didn't this time, closing his door next, and the last of their conversation Seymour could hear - as they walked away - was Escobar saying, 'I was planning to apprehend them, you know, quietly...' Seymour turned off the torch, levered open the boot, placed his valise on the road, and got out. From behind the beetle-curve of the car's wing, he watched as Escobar and Loach approached Mr Duffy and Mr Walsh, who were standing beside Mulwray's car. Muted by the distance and cacophony of the street, he couldn't hear what was said, but saw Loach handcuff the two private investigators. They stood side by side as Escobar and Loach withdrew toward their car and Seymour lowered his bulk. But the detectives turned and returned - as Gittes got out of car across the street ' like yo-yo's, thought Seymour, but without any of the fun. Gittes was followed by Claude Mulverhille and Noah Cross. All coming together, thought Seymour. Loach and Escobar reached Gittes just after the private investigator had smiled at his employees. They raised their cuffed arms in a reply that was just as mute at any distance. A discussion followed, of which Seymour could hear little (bar 'He's rich!' from Gittes, 'He thinks he can get away with anything!') but which he was certain was an argument. Gittes' jawline looked like a rat snapping at those that had cornered the animal, the tendons of his neck looking like they could well snap, his eyes bulging as if his sanity had already, perhaps. Loach cuffed him, also. Evelyn Mulwray and Katherine Cross (One A Cross, thought Seymour, with all the satisfaction of solving a crossword clue) emerged from a side street and Noah Cross stalked away after them. A commotion ensued. Evelyn pulled a short spar of silver, which by the way she was holding it, and by the retreat of Noah Cross, Seymour took to be a gun. Gittes confirmed this, shouting, 'Evelyn put that gun away, let the police handle this.' Mrs Mulwray shouted, 'He owns the police!' Noah Cross was back at the car, opening the door beside Katherine Cross. A gunshot. Noah Cross stepped back, holding his left flank. Seymour didn't move. Evelyn Mulwray was in the driver's seat of the car, closing the door, driving away. 'Halt!' Another gun- this time Escobar's. Bang, bang, bang. Two at the neon-lit air above Chinatown, one at the air in the tyres of the Packard. The first two hit, the third missed. Gittes wrestled with him. Then Loach, darting forward like a fencer, but with none of the etiquette. Bang. Bang. Bang. Touch. The banshee keening of the Packard's horn, followed by the equally long winded wail of a human female screaming. The Packard slowed to a stop, further down the street, by the COCKTAILS bar. Seymour abruptly needed an Angel Face. Seymour got up and followed the general hectic sprint of Gittes, Cross, Mulverhille, Escobar, Loach, Duffy, Walsh and all the diverse actors, to the scene. All Seymour could manage was a walk. By the time he arrived, Evelyn Mulwray was dead and hanging out of the driver's seat, a big bloody hole where her right eye socket should have been, and Gittes was being led in the opposite direction", "label": 1}
{"text": "by Mr Walsh and Mr Duffy, a lack of emotion in his eyes. That emotion seemed to be hope, or any kind of trust in humankind. Certainly, there was a new vacancy, as if his eyes had been blown out as well. Then, Gittes turned again toward the Packard and the screaming Katherine Cross, an expression starting up on his face which may have been rage, but Mr Walsh said to him, 'Forget it Jake; it's Chinatown.' Seymour didn't know what this meant. They led Gittes away A crowd had gathered around the Packard, staring at Evelyn Mulwray's body. Noah Cross, limping though he had apparently been shot in the arm, pulled Katherine Cross after him. One, A Cross, thought Seymour. She was as good as dead, now. Four down. (H Mulwray. Ida Sessions. Leroy Shudarht. K Cross.) One left to kill. Seymour stared at the alley opposite the cocktails bar, and at the apartment he couldn't see at its end. Burnt out, it suited Chinatown at night, blending in perfectly. Seymour didn't, didn't suit anywhere since he had failed Innsmouth. The locals of Chinatown had started to notice him, staring as they had at the corpse of Mrs Mulwray, and Seymour walked away. [Crossword with only August Derleth left uncrossed] 2 - A Sure Way Of Making Enemies -And How To Avoid It Principle 2 - Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, \"You're wrong.\" I am convinced now that nothing good is accomplished and a lot of damage can be done if you tell a person straight out that he or she is wrong. You only succeed in stripping that person of self-dignity and making yourself an unwelcome part of any discussion. 'So. I would normally serve this differently.' Cross waved his knife in the curve of a question mark over the throat. The blade stabbed not a ray of sun but a reflection of it ' off the ocean. The beam dazzled as it died, as a faerie might, if Seymour believed in faeries. He held great stock in demons, of course, and, now casting glance quick at Katherine Cross, quick as the cast for catching in salt water, he might have started to believe this really was a city of angels. But faeries; no. They ate under a pagoda on the deck of the Albacore Club. It wasn't, however, a question. Noah Cross would normally serve this dish with its head. 'I thought this way...' Cross reached out and touched the leg of Katherine Cross who remained as white and stony as the walls of the Albacore Club, and goose bumped as though pebble-dashed. '' would be more appropriate.' Katherine Cross stared straight ahead as Seymour imagined Evelyn Cross would, somewhere else, severed from her body. Katherine, however, used both eyes. Seymour wondered where Noah Cross kept the head, before concluding that he had most likely eaten it. 'Some more breast, please,' said Seymour. The help stepped to the table, pulled back the summery-light, begonia embroidered dress at the cleavage, and carved, before serving Seymour's plate. The ocean rippled in the same kind of way as the help, calm, but forever on the move, and, Seymour sensed, broiling deep beneath. Katherine Cross did not so much as twitch, though flies landed on her just as they did the cuts of the course. Seymour guessed the broiling would be the same. He felt jealous of the flies. She wore the identical twin of the dress on the meal, on her mother, with nothing by way of undergarments. Amongst other things, Noah had taken her underwear from her. She retained, at least, all of her skin. 'Quite right to serve it this way,' Seymour said. There was a silence and Seymour filled it as he did his gut; habitually. 'Quite right.' 'Right?' said Noah Cross. 'Right?' He didn't stop eating, chewing his food as though he were tasting the word. 'You've got as much cojones as this plate.' He waved his cutlery over the dead body of his daughter. 'And stop doing that thing with your face. You might think it a shit eating smile, boy, but I can tell you it looks like no smile I know.' There was a pause in the conversation even Seymour thought better of ending. He ate, instead, to tie up his tongue. 'Not much eating there,' said Noah Cross of the flesh above the ribs, noting his syllables with the knife in small bouncing jabs, 'but then the best bits are the smallest. It's how you use them, eh, son'' he laughed, and his eyes had that way of his of looking tighter and meaner the more his lips loosened. Noah said, 'Have you tried pituitary cut thin as a mouse's cock and fried with a little flour?' Seymour shook his head. His mouth was full. 'Even better,' Cross leaned forward, his knife with him, becoming intimate in its jabbing. 'The inner thighs. Woman like this, at her age they've been nicely tenderised, right?' Cross gave a throaty laugh. Seymour could see Evelyn's larynx, half-chewed, bobbing in there. Katherine gulped and began to quietly cry. It would have been silent, but for the slight dipping. Seymour wanted to reach out and wipe them off her chin. Keep the moisture in a vial. He decided against it. 'So, son,' said Noah Cross. 'It's time for our little discussion. I need to set everything straight, now it's in motion, all my horses need to be galloping the same way. You'll see how I do this later, but no more distractions. The Ancient One tires of waiting. Now, this is how we go forward,' Cross was working on the second breast, now, it bulged his cheek. 'All I want to hear from you, son, is 'right', 'you're right', or 'right you are', okay?' Seymour nodded and Cross stared. 'Right,' said Seymour, continuing with the nodding. 'I will steal the water of Los Angeles and fill the reservoir at the valley's head.' 'Right.'", "label": 1}
{"text": "'I will bring the newly awakened Ancient One up the aqueducts into the valley...' 'You're right.' '' and I will give my daughter who is my granddaughter to the ancient one, and it will impregnate her with the seed of a thousand of Its Great Likeness.' Cross and his knife waited. 'Right.' Said Seymour. He choked on the 'you are' and spat a hunk of bicep he had been chewing onto the pearly white table cloth. It looked like the flesh of a mussel, lying there. Katherine's muscles set into a light palsy. Seymour wanted to comfort her, but guessed a cuddle would be out of the question. 'From her will be born an army of our people. But pure, purer than they have been for centuries.' 'You're right.' 'We will take this city by surprise. It will be our new Innsmouth. But bigger, far bigger, an Everything Mouth. A mouth into Hell.' 'Right.' 'All you need to do is kill the last name on my list. The last name in L.A. who knows this is all true. August Derleth.' 'You're quite right.' 'It's time to go.' 'Right you are.' Cross rose. 'Get up,' he said. 'Oh...right.' said Seymour, and he got up. As he did so, he had the sense of something walking over his grave. Not a goose-bumping and a shivering, but a heavy, cold, loamish suffocation, as though he were buried alive. Despite his unnatural looks, and his servitude of a deity of alien intelligence which viewed all of humanity as meat and all morality as offal, then, right then, he felt there was something terribly wrong about all this. 3 - If You're Wrong, Admit It When we are right, let's try to win people gently and tactfully to our way of thinking, and when we are wrong - and that will be surprisingly often, if we are honest with ourselves - let's admit our mistakes quickly and with enthusiasm. Not only will that technique produce astonishing results; but, believe it or not, it is a lot more fun, under the circumstances, than trying to defend oneself. Remember the old proverb: \"By fighting you never get enough, but by yielding you get more than you expected.\" ' Principle 3 - If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically. 'No you can't be right!' said Seymour bent over by the straight-line stillness of the body on his bed, his hands clasped, exhorting. He pulled his hands to his mouth, barring his lips with his fingers, through which, and despite the webbing, a whisper managed to slip. 'Can it be wrong?' Katherine did not reply. She was laid low by excessive drugs, passed out in a line like she had been laid prematurely in her coffin. Later, of course, after Cthulhu, she wouldn't fit into a coffin. Seymour looked up and sideways at the stars he could see between the bars of his window. Five days prematurely, he counted. He returned his gaze to his wall, and his thoughts to what he had gotten wrong. Their stars. The wall in front of him was a mosaic of unconnected events. Red lines ran from a massacre to the Reichstag, to two guns Crawley, to the Word of Cross, but dwindled in between one and another, became dots, and then an absence of a line, as much as the absence between stars. We follow not the stars but the darkness between them, Seymour thought. The universe is too big and too black to care for the fate of gnats. Cthulhu can't be wrong... But there she was- Katherine Cross, at the centre of the wall, at its point where all the lines intersected; emanating from her line after line, each connecting. The death of Mr Mulwray, the shooting of Mrs Mulwray the Cross Word, the coming of Cthulhu in her flesh, the writing of Lovecraft, and by extension The Friends of Lovecraft, and by extension of that red line again, August Derleth. Seymour's gaze fell on the two copies of 'How to Win Friends and Influence People' that lay on the bed stand. Orange and Green. First and second editions. Its publication. The water wars of Los Angeles. The death of Lovecraft and the end of Innsmouth. He paced around the bed, wall led to wall, strode to the window, returned to the bed. 'Ever since you, life has been making sense... that can't be right. It has to be wrong,' he hissed. 'All narratives are lies humans tell themselves.' Both books looked offended by this idea. Still, he couldn't stop staring at the centre of the wall, where all the lines came together, or he could, but when he did, he stared at the young girl on his bed, and her hair seemed to shine, he didn't like to think it, a little like the luminescence of a star, a star he could follow. He stared at the wall and whispered, 'The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents'. He stopped. He scratched his head. A scale of skin snow flaked to the floor. 'That's it!' he said. He had seen how it would all come together. In the reading of a short story. In a short story reading. How Derleth would die. 4 - A Drop Of Honey Aesop was a Greek slave who lived at the court of Croesus and spun immortal fables six hundred years before Christ. Yet the truths he taught about human nature are just as true in Boston and Birmingham now as they were twenty-six centuries ago in Athens.

{"text": "a friendly way. [Advert] Creatures of myth deep in the sea have long held a fascination for writers. Do they exist? What depraved natives worship them? How many tentacles do they have? Los Angeles may be the city of the silver screen, but it is also the city of the silvered sea, and what is down there waiting? This is a call for any writers to read their creepy, tentacular works ' the weird the dark and the strange- at City Hall on December the Third. Have you been dreaming for about three years of a Cyclopean beast lurking not far off Catalina Island? Readings begin at ten o'clock and will be judged by a leading publisher. The winner will be published and read on every shore and across every ocean of the globe. [Drawing of Cthulhu] By-line- Moses C. Sorree August Derleth had seen him across the hall and looked over not so much now and then but now and now and now with eyes lidded and suspicious. Still, Derleth didn't leave. Seymour presumed reading the short story advert would have been like twirling the dial on a radio and finding that you were listening to your own voice, reading out your own thoughts. (The first one being, Oh My God is that my voice?) Derleth perhaps could as little leave as resist the invitation, but had half-concealed himself amongst the crowd at the far end of the room, behind one of the tall marble pillars that supported the ceiling. Each of these pillars shone under a bright, upended-mammary shaped lantern, and shone in straight vertical lines, as though oblongs of luminescence had been drawn on their cylinders. The crowd was a restless series of lines between the pillars and along the pews, then flanking the town halls walls, many scribbling on paper furiously. More writers had replied to the advert than Seymour expected, and he wondered what the collective term for writers was; a desperation? Seymour was surprised he had been spotted by Derleth. He was, after all, wearing his new disguise; thick rimmed round glasses, a long fake nose, and a large stick-on moustache that he would have called 'cumbersome' if he could open his lips for longer than one syllable words. 'You look like an idiot,' said the White Mouse. 'Where did you get it? 'Le Grande Mid Get Tion,' rumbled Seymour. The White Mouse looked sharply at him, a sharpness snapped by one of his several twitches. 'That shop in Chinatown. Between the bookstore and the tea importers, yes? That weird little man, eh?' Seymour glanced down at him. He nodded. 'Thing is,' continued the White Mouse. 'You look like yourself, yes, but just a stupid yourself, hmm?' Seymour's glance became a stare. 'You look stupid,' the White Mouse clarified. Before; 'You not gonna look as big a fool as Claude, though. Look at him, yes.' Claude Mulverhille was sat in the front row; sat there by Seymour, on Noah Cross's orders. He was, as the White Mouse had described; big. His lip was curled as though he were smoking his habitual stogie, though this being the town hall he of course couldn't. Instead, the curl did for denoting scorn and a disgruntlement at having to follow Seymour's instructions. In his hand was clamped the sheaf of paper Seymour had given him. A short story. 'The problem with a story reading,' said the White Mouse. '' Is he cannot read?' There had been several readings already. Seymour had placed the advert some time ago and had used Noah Cross's connections to book City Hall. Ever since the earthquake of '34 people had been, like Leroy Shudarht, sculpting, painting, charcoaling, and writing fevered half dreams of what lay beneath the Pacific's silvered surface. This was the best way Seymour could think of to draw them out. It would, he was sure, lead to several more of Words of Cross. [Crossword of August Derleth.] The short story judge turned to the front row and winced. The judge was Shimkin and his black clothing was now covering several patches of dark skin given to him by the man he winced at - Claude Mulverhille. Claude had convinced him over the last month to judge this event. When it came to persuasion, Mulverhille was not a dripper of honey. He preferred to drop people. The pen may have been mightier than the sword, but Mulverhille carried a gun. Seymour was unsure if Shimkin's wince was caused by the pain of turning, or fear of Claude. If he had looked like an uncoiled spring, before, now- he was broken. 'And next,' he croaked. 'Is this, ah... gentleman... Sir..?' His voice was weak and if not for the hard echo of the hall's marble pillars and tiling, would not have reached Seymour at the back. The fight had gone out of Shimkin and perhaps because, Seymour thought, remembering Mulverhille's fists, the fight had gone into him. '' Sir?... You're... ah next..?' Mulverhille rose. Whenever he walked, he ambled and led with a fist, either left or right, like a lazy boxer, or a cocky one, jabbing hand by the belly. Now, the gait hesitated, the stance stammered, not as if he were punch drunk but rather more desperate for a drink. This was an enemy he couldn't fight. Public speaking. He made the podium. Even from his distance at the rear of the hall, Seymour could see he was gulping, his throat coming up dry every time, in contrast with his forehead, which was patently wet. 'The... ah... the'' croaked Claude. 'Speak up,' shouted the Town Hall, in three or four voices at once. It had become a favoured catcall of the morning. So far, seven had read, three of which would make Seymour Smile when there was nobody to witness it. He had made a note of their names. Mulverhille tried to speak up and managed an accidental shout.

Maybe if I put you inside then you would fuck off when you were supposed to like everybody else, eh? Disappear, yes?' He pushed past her and walked away, saying. 'Comment aimez-vous ces pommes?' At the end of the 'pommes' he raised his arms then let them fall. There was a bright flash of light and a hiss that did not seem dramatic enough for it, and the Midgetian was gone, leaving an after image on Seymour's retinas not of an explosion, but of a smug, French grin. A delighted cheer rose from the deck, though neither the delight nor the cheer reached the spinster's features. Seymour took the folded Los Angeles Post Record from underneath his right arm and repositioned it under his left. There were daub marks from his armpits, lapping up against the crossword which folded as it was, now faced outward. From under the underhang of his left arm -where his loose tricep hung wet against his black shirt- 'Derleth' could be read, but not 'August'. Seymour turned and ambled along the deck toward the stairs that would take him up to the viewing poop. There, he knew, he would see speedboats running alongside the SS Catalina, welcoming the ship into Avalon Bay, now they were nearing the end of their two hour journey. Teak topped, flat sterned boats, the wood of which was continued in the finish of the deck Seymour now waddled along. The water in this part of the bay looked like curacao and ice, its reflection wavering whiter than the white of the SS Catalina's hull. Curacao was Seymour's kind of drink but not his type of sea. Pure and blue: two adjectives which had nothing to do with him or his home. From the corners of his wet eyes, he saw where couples lounged together in the niches of the deck. Children played hide and seek, disturbing them, or around the lifeboats, or hide and hide at the sight of Seymour. The clowns that had been hired, like the magicians, for their entertainment seemed to grow paler at his advance. Once, one of their balloons had popped in a clown's hand, held close and perhaps protectively to the clown's crotch, startling a small wet patch onto his big red pantaloons. It took some time for Seymour to mount the steps to the upper deck. There, the three Friends of Lovecraft he was stalking lounged against the forward rail, young men forging on to a new land. Heads facing the Pacific whipping breeze, its racing, cropped water, hands dangling as though they could touch its thoroughbred promise. The first's big ears did not bend in the wind but seemed to act as sails, bearing the SS Catalina on into harbour. The second had vast planes of skin: cheeks, forehead, even his eyes, when he turned enough, were dark seemingly from one end to the other, as though all of him had been carved and lazily painted. He could have been the figurehead of a tall ship, limping into a new continent. The third ate an apple as if he had seen the Midgetian's show and was worried it would disappear. The Friends of Lovecraft: Mark Schorer, Donald Wandrei, and August Derleth; the target. August carried a valise. Seymour sighed and tried to grit his teeth. (He failed - having no molars to speak of, nor canines; but thick, yellowed shark teeth, rows of which marched pointedly back over the pink flesh of his gums, and which clashed against each other jarringly.) Seymour knew from experience; a man with a valise was almost impossible to kill. Seymour watched them from a distance; from the other end of the poop deck, and downwind. Beyond the men, the Island of Catalina hunkered, buff coloured hills rising from Avalon Bay, spotted with bushes so dry they couldn't be called greenery. The palm trees where the hills met the narrow beach jauntily high-fived the Pacific wind. Unaware, thought Seymour, of what lay out there, and not near Polynesia, but closer now and watching with many eyes. In a slow curve, they reached a jetty made skeletal by rods and spars and winches and cranes. They queued. Seymour's fingers itched to the pocket where he kept his knife, curved and painted with teeth perpendicularly along its blade, gummy red along its edges. He called it his Smile. He gingerly touched it. The Smile felt unsure. Now, could be the time; behind August Derleth in the queue, a knifing to the back, but then he, Seymour, would be stuck there, above August as he died, looking like he, Seymour, did: monstrous, proximate, guilty. No, now wasn't the time. Instead, Seymour stared back out to sea, back out at the eyes he knew were watching him. For his part, the promise Seymour saw whenever he stared out across the Pacific was the shimmering image of a pale, pearlescent Cross. Her name was Katherine. And while it wasn't the time for her either, his thoughts couldn't help themselves. He blinked as the three finished queuing and filed after them out onto the wharf. Seymour followed and watched as August threw the core of his apple, bitten down to the pips, into the curacao-blue water. August's hair was a tightly curled coif which didn't move at all in despite of the strong island breeze. Schorer's hair wisped up, giving him the look of baldness in waiting, while Wandrei's comb-over flapped. They talked easily as they walked along the jetty and off onto the wide curve of the road that led around to the Avalon Theatre. Seymour looked left as he turned right off the jetty to stalk them. The Albacore club lay that way and Seymour wished he could stop there, sample the catch of the day. Maybe tomorrow it would be August Derleth. For", "label": 1}
{"text": "was also swallowing, but different reasons. 'Your title Mr Mulverhille, sir?' Mulverhille stared at Shimkin, not perhaps in a threatening way, but as if trying to decipher what the old man in black was; what shadow was it that played, like those on Plato's cave, before him? Shimkin, for his part, seemed to take the stare as a threat. 'Mr..?' tried Mulverhille. 'Nothing, nothing, go on,' Shimkin said. 'The most merciful thing in the world,' read Claude Mulverhille. 'I think, is the in... in... inability of the human mind to coral-hate all its con... tents.' Mulverhille breathed, maybe for the first time since stepping onto the podium. He wiped the back of his hand across his forehead, then against his trouser leg. Seymour glanced across the hall. By this point, August Derleth was stepping forward and backward, irritation on his face, an apple in his mouth. The apple was red and ripe and overgrown, really, for his jawline, which did the splits about it. If the apple was forbidden knowledge, this was too much knowledge to swallow, all in one bite. August had realised what was happening. 'We live,' Mulverhille read this to rhyme with nosedive, 'on a placid is... is...land of ignorance,' ('ignorance' was accurately pronounced) ' ' in the midst of black seas of infinity'' Now, Mulverhille rolled through the words, like a man descending a slope of scree, unable to stop or slow himself, '' and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction'' Now - thought Seymour - terminal velocity; Claude Mulverhille's mouth and eyes as wide as any man falling and screaming. '' havehithertoharmeduslittle;butsomedaythepiecing togetherofdissociatedknowledgewillopenupsuchterrifyingvistasofreality'' Mulverhille was forced to breathe. Sweat trembled off his lips. When he resumed, his pace was oddly even. '' and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.' Along from Mulverhille, an expression had arrived on Shimkin's face not unlike the described age. His lips looked as though they were whispering, 'no, no, no,' though the sound did not reach Seymour. Claude continued. 'Theosop... sophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle wherein our world and human race form transient incidents.' 'Amen!' shouted a shabby-jacketed man toward the back. Seymour had taken his name earlier. Something biblical. August Derleth was seeping forward though the crowd, mouth still roast-pig-stuffed, and now approached the podium. His eyes were as big as the apple, as Mulverhille's. Claude continued, 'They have hinted at strange survivals in terms which would freeze the blood if not masked by a bland optimism. But it is not from them that there came the single glimpse of forbidden eons which chills me when I think of it and maddens me when I dream of it. That glimpse, like all dread glimpses of truth, flashed out from an accidental piecing together of separated things - in this case an old newspaper '' 'NO!' Shimkin shouted. 'No, No, no. I will not listen to this tripe anymore! Again!' He stood up too quickly and winced, grasping his ribs. 'I don't care what you do to me.' Mulverhille stared in reply, 'newspaper' dripping off his lips. If he had held a cigar there it would have dropped smouldering to the brown tiles of the floor. He stared some more. 'What whimsical self-serving claptrap,' shouted Shimkin. 'Yes, he had a vocabulary, but so what, so do those trained natives with their hand signals. Where is the character? Where is the jeopardy? Where is the pacing? Or does he just want to preach?' 'I didn't bloody write it,' drawled Mulverhille. The look in his eyes emphasised the 'bloody'. 'I know that! And I know who put you up to it.' Seymour started forward, his false moustache jostling against his cheeks, chafing slightly. 'I think it's good,' Seymour shouted. 'I find it very Bel..Ive... A... Ball. Bug... ger... this...' He ripped off his moustache and threw it through the air behind him. It landed with the sound of a squirrel falling off a branch; but unheard in the sudden tumult; a squirrel dying in a forest fire. 'Yes,' shouted another in the hall. 'What he said!' A third person stood. 'It's good... in a weird, dark and intelligent way.' Seymour pushed through the crowd toward August. The humans parted before him easily, almost instinctively, as the tongue shies from rot. One amongst the crowd shouted. 'I really quite like it!' Another; 'It left me feeling warm on the inside!' A third; 'I think my mother would like it!' He was almost on August. 'Yes, you! You,' said Shimkin, pointing before ' again - wincing and withdrawing the point. 'August Derleth and your fucking love of Lovecraft... you're behind this rubbish!' August Derleth shouted, 'It wasn't me- but it is genius!' Seymour slipped his Smile out of his pocket. August spun. 'Get away from me' he said. Seymour feigned surprise, which was not easy to feign while he held his Smile above Derleth's head. 'Who me?' August backed away. 'I know who you are. Just because you're wearing a nose... Did you get that at a joke shop?' Seymour frowned. He as little knew why people kept saying this as how they kept recognising him. Normally, he could use his Smile to carve his name in his forehead, and people would purposefully forget who he was. August ran. Seymour waddled at a brisk pace. 'Stop!' he shouted after the Friend of Lovecraft. Derleth ignored this, running along the edge of the town hall ' then behind a marble pillar- before squeezing along a pew of seats. Huffing, Seymour tried to follow, but could not fit between the pews. August jumped over the last pew's dark-wood back, landing with a clatter of feet onto the tiled floor.

{"text": "The White Mouse sprang to trap Derleth at the door but abruptly slipped. Short as he had always been he now disappeared entirely behind the pew-backs, Derleth kept going, as did Seymour. Derleth had now reached the rectangle that was door to the bright afternoon. He turned and brought up one silhouetted finger. He showed this to Seymour, then ran, disappearing from sight. 'Nobody will remember his work!' Seymour said, but in a whisper. He had meant to shout. He lent against a pew. He really needed to sit down. The White Mouse rose from where he had slipped. In his hand he held what seemed to be a small, furry dead mammal, but what Seymour soon recognised as his moustache. 'Yes...' breathed the White Mouse. '' This didn't just make you look like an idiot, no?' 5 - The Secret Of Socrates Socrates, \"the gadfly of Athens,\" was one of the greatest philosophers the world has ever known. He did something that only a handful of men in all history have been able to do: he sharply changed the whole course of human thought; and now, twenty-four centuries after his death, he is honored as one of the wisest persuaders who ever influenced this wrangling world. His method? Did he tell people they were wrong? Oh, no, not Socrates. He was far too adroit for that. His whole technique, now called the \"Socratic method,\" was based upon getting a \"yes, yes\" response. He asked questions with which his opponent would have to agree. He kept on winning one admission after another until he had an armful of yeses. He kept on asking questions until finally, almost without realizing it, his opponents found themselves embracing a conclusion they would have bitterly denied a few minutes previously. The next time we are tempted to tell someone he or she is wrong, let's remember old Socrates and ask a gentle question - a question that will get the \"yes, yes\" response. ' Principle 5 - Get the other person saying \"yes, yes\" immediately. Seymour turned in his seat and looked back through the rear window at, when the darkening dust had settled, the West. The chain link fence at the West-gate was a gauze over the end of the day. Lacerated sunset bled through. The sign on the gate, now reversed, was the silhouetted shape and colour of a gunshot wound, surrounded as it was by the red of the day's end, or so Seymour estimated. He worked by knife. Claude carried the gun. 'Stay still,' said Claude, shuffling his left buttock against Seymour's right. There wasn't much room on the back seat. To the right Claude, middle Seymour, and left, the White Mouse's red piranha in its tank, gaffer taped to the seat. To the furthest left of this, almost on the wheel arch, hips and bottom in the footwell, was Ross Yellburton, the Water Commissioner. He was not shuffling. When he had been shoved there, the White Mouse had said, 'If you knock my little Goldfish, I don't care who you are, I will decommission you in the water, yes?' Sometimes, Seymour was surprised by the White Mouse's vocabulary. So, it seemed, had been Ross Yellburton, who had simply stared from his hole by the door, and the White Mouse had repeated himself at high volume with a switch-blade in his hand until the Water Commissioner had said, 'Yes. Yes! Yes!!' as though he were enjoying himself far too much. By the look ' and tears- on his face, Mr Yellburton wasn't enjoying himself at all. In its tank, the red piranha grinned toothily. Seymour turned back, the sight behind them still burned into his sight by the last embers of the day's sun. Though reversed and silhouetted, Seymour had been this way many times, and knew the sign ' like the monument they drove toward- was not yet completed, and read, [Sign- Construction Pablo Alto Dam Trespassers Will Be] In fact, an influx of unheralded labour (shuffling, laconic, bug-eyed, bald or balding, Dagon) had brought the reservoir and dam closer to completion than it had any right to be, in that time. The sign, as it did behind the car, lagged behind. Ahead, an array of workers' tents had sprung up around the reservoir like coral on the newly hewn rock. Seymour pressed his hands to the leather of the seat, a cooling rag to the flush of his skin. These times always made him sweaty on the outside and, inside, boiling, bubbling, frothing, close to malfunction, like an overfilled kettle. In the front, sat the White Mouse; driving, and Noah Cross; smoking. 'I've done everything you've asked, everything,' said Ross Yellburton, not for the first time. If you were to do a thumbnail sketch of the Water Commissioner Ross Yellburton, thought Seymour, it couldn't help but be accurate. Short, bald, round-headed, chinless ' he looked like a thumb, just draw on a black moustache and two little eyes made glassy by the nail and, of course, by terror. 'You've done everything we asked,' replied Claude Mulverhille in a drawl as low and gritted as the progress of the tyres below them. The road around the reservoir was as unfinished as the rest, a skit of stones, a jazz ensemble of ground rock. 'Yes' Yes!' said Yellburton, which, thought Seymour, was a good start. Noah Cross wanted Yes men around him, that was the point of the sacrifices. Well, he amended, Yes entities. If only Mulwray had realised the same, so much could have been avoided. Cross sat in the passenger seat, in front of Yellburton. Cross was silent. Seymour reckoned Yellburton would be living up to the first syllable of his name, before the night was through. The car pulled to a stop, its brakes an insistent squeak, and Seymour motioned toward the left rear door. Yellburton got out, the flecks of colour in his tie (not many, as few as his follicles) catching the last light. Stars", "label": 1}
{"text": "were out in the East and some in the South. The Ancient One would like that, thought Seymour, though not as much as the tenor of Yellburton's terror. Seymour tried to get out of the car, but could not because Claude stood there. Seymour felt sure Mulverhille could see him, but made no move to allow Seymour egress. If there was a pecking order, Seymour was the seed. Then, there was the short story reading at the Town Hall. It had stuck in Mulverhille's mind, Seymour was sure. Claude's mind may have been apt to forget, but once it didn't, he would never forgive. Still, Claude finally moved, his footsteps crinkling across the gravel and around the parked car. The now Chief Water Engineer (since Hollis Mulwray had passed away) had gone nowhere and seemed, maybe, to shrink into the spot he was stood in. Seymour followed Claude to the boot. Mulverhille popped it and inside, like a day-end sale at the fish market, were several not quite fresh squid and octopuses. They were fashioned into masks. Claude gagged. 'Jaysus, couldn't they have got fresh ones?' he grunted, lifting his. 'Wearing this is like giving a dolphin a blow job.' Seymour didn't respond. He was glad the dusk was now closing in, chill and light as fresh linen. He felt a little homesick, and made his sniffing into a sound a little like retching into his own mouth. It paid to agree with Claude, or to seem to. The human was, at his best, an insecure prick. Apart from the masks, the boot was filled with blood red robes (the red was not their original hue), and dual coloured jewellery (gold and Cathy ruby red, or gold and Philippine sapphire blue). For Cross there was a harpoon to replace his staff, one inscribed with odd hieroglyphs of uncertain origin, a harpoon barbed and alien but one that no Quahog would be proud of throwing. Too short, its haft no longer than the head of a Pequod spear. And it wasn't, as Noah had intoned once, for the hunting of creatures of the deep, but for those creatures, for they had designed the harpoon first; the stingray's barbed tail, the jellyfish's sting, even sea snails with their fatal needles. Claude put on the robe and mask and the jewellery. In the mask's cuts his eyes glowered. 'Come on you,' he said to Yellburton, 'Let's get you over and done with.' It may have been Claude Mulverhille's phrasing, it may have been Seymour, the White Mouse and Noah Cross all garbing themselves as Mulverhille had, but Yellburton whimpered and a patch, dark enough to be seen even in this light, daubed the crotch of his finely cut pants, and added a line to the threading down his inner thigh. 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry,' said Yellburton. It was surprisingly how much men repeated themselves in situations such as these. Like a toddler avoiding bed, thought Seymour. Nighty night. 'There, there,' said Claude, not untenderly. 'Don't worry about your pants. You'll be getting wet through in a minute ' nobody'll notice a bit of piss.' What followed was less tender. 'Worry about the fucking pain.' Claude laughed. Yellburton didn't, but was forced to follow the heavy along the narrow pass to the dam's edge. Cross, a silhouette against the downing sun apart from a potato print of red light that was the end of his recently lit cigar, did the same, carrying his mask. Seymour slipped his on, took a deep nasal breath and followed, knife tight in his hand. It was close, and not just the weather. There was a hiss as Cross allowed his cigar to fall into the reservoir, and a rubbery stretching sound as he pulled on his mask. His harpoon was a ragged but rhythmic scrape on the concrete. The night had become sounds (the 'sorrying' away of Yellburton, mainly), divested of visual expression by the masks, of smell by the same. Yellburton's apologies went from a mutter of 'I'm sorry,' to a shout of 'I'm' I'm,' to a wail. 'I have a wife and children, my children. I have children.' 'Hey,' said Claude. 'What's the worst that can happen? By the end of tonight, you'll still have a wife and you'll still have children, Mr Yellburton. I guess they might not have a husband or a dad, anymore.' There was a pause. Seymour couldn't see it, but he could hear the liquid, smug grin flooding the bottom of Claude's face, the liquid bubbling, hunk-hunk of the Water Commissioner's snotty breathing. It was the snuffling of a child in a headmaster's office. He didn't understand, he didn't know why he was being punished, but he had to pretend he did, take his punishment; it would go worse for him if he didn't. Ignorance and fists. Now, as Claude dragged Yellburton into the middle of the reservoir, there was a speed and confidence to the scrapes of shined shoes on dust. Claude was a bully. He was in his element. Down below, not yet full, but filling, was Seymour's element. In the water, Seymour could hear the flopping of tentacles. There wasn't depth enough for all of the Ancient One, not until New Year, but its reach was long enough to stretch in from the sea. They were at the water and Mulverhille dragged Yellburton down onto the jutting-out lower lip of concrete that ran around it. The exclamations of Cross's harpoon stopped at the end of the walkway. Seymour followed Mulverhille down, using the hand-rails and what light shone still from the West. Seymour noticed again that the water wasn't still. The dusk was windless, close and balmy enough to embalm Seymour in thick, glutinous sweat, the reservoir of course tideless. But he could hear it and could see the lines of tightly-woven waves. Their frequency was amplified by the thrashing motion beneath them, a movement darker and more solid than the rest of the reservoir. His", "label": 1}
{"text": "tentacles, but only His tentacles. His body would have to wait for her body to lure Him in. Yellburton whimpered. They ' Claude and the White Mouse and Seymour and Yellburton- stopped there, on the tight ledge, up against the aquifer wall, still close to the draconian sound of breath that came from Cross's congealed, cigar-smoked lungs. (Clickety-click went the mucus filled bronchia, click-click-click answered the haft-end of the harpoon.) Then began the beating. The White Mouse acted as its narrator and Claude as its cast. 'He'll punch you here, right, in between these ribs, with his ring hand, right, and you'll cut up good, on the outside, and he'll do it again, and the cutting up'll be on the inside too, right, Mr Water Commissioner, and you'll cough up blood, yes?' Claude did the first, his fist coming back up for air; poised for the latter punch. 'You understand Mr Water Commissioner, yes?' A pause. The silence hung heavy as Claude's meaty fist. 'Yes?' 'Yes! Yellburton coughed. 'Next time he hits you, right, you'll bleed into the water, yes? Something out there, right, something not like us, not with the normal number of hands I'll say, right, yes? Something that will be liking the smell of your blood and soon its taste, right, yes? Something will smell the blood and take an interest, no?' Yellburton had been 'yes'ing his way through the last words. 'Yes'Yes'Yes'' Socrates, thought Seymour, would have been impressed. 'That's enough. Isn't it, Mr Yellburton?' said Cross unexpectedly, or unexpected by Claude. '' Yes.' Noah Cross bent down for the lip of the dam, leaning over the Water Commissioner. 'You'll do what we say, won't you?' 'Yes.' 'You already have been. Haven't you?' 'Yes.' 'You'll follow our lead, our ways, our Gods?' 'Yes' Yes!' Louder. Now, Yellburton was living up to his name. 'Yes!' 'That's fine,' said Cross. Despite the lack of a question, there was still an answering, 'Yes!' 'Aw, Boss. I was just getting into this.' The White Mouse raised his own fist now, smaller than Claude's; a night bird, bobbing over the background water. 'The Ancient One is near, eh, and I had to wear this dickish mask, and'' 'We came, Mouse,' said Cross gently. 'To make an offering to our Gods.' 'Oh, well, that's a 'yes!''' The Mouse's fist perked up, sensing its prey, prepared to let fly. 'No,' whispered Yellburton. Claude raised his left arm, and his gun at the end of it. Mulverhille shot the Mouse in his shoulder. The Mouse's fist took startled flight, along with the rest of the White Mouse, blown up and out over the concrete lip of the aquifer, and down and, with a splash and then a crack of imminent concrete, into the part filled reservoir and against its bottom. The splash had been meaty, but not as meaty as the latter impact, and yet still there was no hint of blood. The lack of clouds cast a coat of silver over the reservoir, which quickened with the movement beneath its surface, which churned, which boiled and seemed to melt into itself as metal in a forge. The Mouse was yelling as he broke the surface, first an outpouring of water then of a foreign language Seymour did not understand. The words became, if anything, less comprehensible as tentacles tore him limb from torso from limb, and then did the same with his legs. There was a mousy squeak as his joints were ripped from their sockets and a series of pops. There goes the weasel, thought Seymour, though Yellburton had always reminded him more of that species, and the only thing gone about the Water Commissioner appeared to be his mind. He was squealing more than the Mouse. 'Tying up loose ends,' Cross said, to Seymour, though there were plenty of ends floating off in the water, and all of them getting further from each other. The creature below the water appeared satisfied with the torso, for now, but then; it would want to breed, Seymour knew. He thought of Katherine. Cross nodded, smoking through the mouth hole of his mask. 'He let August Derleth go, yes? At the Town Hall, yes?' Seymour remembered Innsmouth and nodded. 'The Mouse slipped up.' On a false moustache, thought Seymour, still nodding. 'I don't tolerate slip ups.' Seymour couldn't stop nodding. Cross turned away, to Yellburton in the dark, and spoke softly, his voice muffled by dead squid and shot through by cigar. 'You know, people say yes men are a bad idea, and I agree, but there is a time and a place for them. Do you know what I mean?' After a pause the Water Commissioner whispered, in what sounded like a question, 'Yes?' Cross nodded and turned on the concrete, the haft-end of his harpoon scratching out the sound of the motion. He walked along the dam and Seymour climbed the ladder in order to follow him. Behind him, Mulverhille did the same, hoisting Yellburton after him. They walked west along the dam. Behind him Seymour heard Mulverhille say, 'So, Yellburton. Now that idiot's gone, I'm going kill his bloody Goldfish. What should I do, batter it, or fry it, or batter it then fry it?' As he said, 'batter it' Claude pounded his hams of fists together. Yellburton didn't reply. Seymour sighed, removed his calamari-mask and walked toward the car park. The sunset that way was the viscous red of the Avalon Theatre, the semi-circular sun dipping to the earth as if a maw eating a virgin, raw horizon. It put Seymour in mind of the next person scheduled to be killed here, and in the mood to romance her. He day-dreamt of driving Katherine out to the reservoir perhaps in her mother's pearlescent Packard (dashboard polished free of blood, dials grouted of brains). They would drive one long afternoon along the I85 out of Los Angeles, her next to him ' pristine, poised, pre-ordained ' the road shotgun straight ahead of", "label": 1}

They would talk about How to Win Friends and Influence People, or just talk about talking ('Chapter 6, Let Others Do The Talking'). Seymour wouldn't witter on, but instead he'd listen to the high-mountain-rivulet-bubbling of her voice, and they would discuss the book, and she would read from it... ('\"They were all seated around a table, so I wrote on a pad of paper: 'Gentlemen, I have lost my voice. I am speechless.' \" 'I'll do the talking for you,' the president said. He did. He exhibited my samples and praised their good points. A lively discussion arose about the merits of my goods. And the president, since he was talking for me, took the position I would have had during the discussion My sole participation consisted of smiles, nods and a few gestures. \"As a result of this unique conference, I was awarded the contract, which called for over half a million yards of upholstery fabrics at an aggregate value of $1,600,000 -the biggest order I had ever received. \"I know I would have lost the contract if I hadn't lost my voice, because I had the wrong idea about the whole proposition. I discovered, quite by accident, how richly it sometimes pays to let the other person do the talking.') ' and below them the Packard would drift along, soft as a gliding ghost, or as a falling angel, or, in soon to be her case; both. 'Hey freak, take off the mask, it's time to go.' Seymour blinked and turned. Claude Mulverhille. 'Oh,' Claude continued. 'You have. God, I hadn't realised that was your actual face. Put the mask back on!' Mulverhille laughed. He was still carrying his gun and raised it. 'This is better than that little fish gutter you carry, eh? Want to trade up, Sea Whore?' Seymour shook his head. The raising of the gun had increased the pace of his thoughts. He imagined pressing a gun into his mouth - the long, cool barrel spangling the nerves of his sharp shark-teeth, the rabbit tooth of the sight pressed into his palate. 'No, I'm no good with guns,' he said. He paused. 'I'd shoot the wrong thing,' he finished. 'Just another of many reasons why you're not a real man,' Mulverhille said and chortled to himself. Seymour followed the sound of it, and the heavy himself, to the Ford de Luxe. It was newly dark, now. Where the White Mouse had driven them into the reservoir, the Water Commissioner drove them out. His moustache and remaining hairs were slicked back with sweat partly carried there by the furtively habitual smoothing of his shaking, wet hands. His head as he steered the car then had a moist, peering look like that of a vermin that had heard a loud bang. His feet clawed at the pedals, over-whelming the engine, so that it stuttered as Yellburton's speech had, giving out often. 'It might be worth calming yourself, my friend,' said Noah Cross, in his normal, passenger seat. 'Breathe deep. Just enjoy being alive.' Though behind the water magnate, Seymour could tell from the tilt of Cross's head ' silhouetted in the spread of the headlights - that he was smiling. 'I'm sure you agree.' They passed the 'Dam Trespassers Will Be' sign a little more smoothly. Noah Cross spoke to Mulverhille over his shoulder and with the dusk breeze as they increased their speed down toward Los Angeles, down the dark and sullen and hungry hills that glittered with lights as a coral reef would with eyes. Seymour knew from experience; it was a jungle down there. 'Mr Mulverhille, you work the lots now, don't you, when you don't work for me?' Claude grunted. 'Do security work for that new guy, Disney.' 'Oh, yes,' Cross's head twitched the words over his shoulder as someone who cared about luck might throw salt. 'I heard all about his film. A cartoon they say, right? Like in the papers, but moving. I hear it's got the sexiest, smoothest skinned woman in it, the kind of your dreams...' Seymour wanted to close his eyes, but didn't. '' Seems some cruel, ugly witch wanted her dead, some cruel, rotted thing, and how she loved fresh apples. Poisoned her with one, I hear, right Mr Mulverhille?' Mulverhille shrugged. 'I just work the door,' he said. 'Cartoons are for kids.' 'Quite right. Quite. Right,' agreed Cross. 'But there's something to them, I'd say, something ancient and true like the oldest of stories.' He needn't add; like our God's. And didn't. Seymour wasn't listening to the last but had cherry-picked words from the preceding lines. Apple. Poisoned. ... to which he added... I know where August Derleth buys his apples. 'Oh,' Cross turned in his seat, both laboriously and lubriciously, smiling as he handed Seymour his green copy of How to Win Friends and Influence People. 'Found this the other day. In your bedroom. Very useful, isn't it? I've marked the page we're on.' Seymour took it. The inside was bumped by a folded page. He opened the book. It was folded at the beginning of chapter seven, the Chapter heading underlined. 'Read it,' said Noah Cross. 'You'll find it fruitful.' Seymour read, ' 7 - How To Get Cooperation Principle 7 - Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.' 8 - A Formula That Will Work Wonders For You Seymour read. 'Remember that other people may be totally wrong. But they don't think so. Don't condemn them. Any fool can do that. Try to understand them. Only wise, tolerant, exceptional people even try to do that. There is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does. Ferret out that reason - and you have the key to his actions, perhaps to his personality. Try honestly to put yourself in his place. If you say to", "label": 1}

Goode in his book How to Turn People Into Gold, \"stop a minute to contrast your keen interest in your own affairs with your mild concern about anything else. Realize then, that everybody else in the world feels exactly the same way! Then, along with Lincoln and Roosevelt, you will have grasped the only solid foundation for interpersonal relationships; namely, that success in dealing with people depends on a sympathetic grasp of the other persons' viewpoint.\" Sam Douglas of Hempstead, New York, used to tell his wife that she spent too much time working on their lawn, pulling weeds, fertilizing, cutting the grass twice a week when the lawn didn't look any better than it had when they moved into their home four years earlier. Naturally, she was distressed by his remarks, and each time he made such remarks the balance of the evening was ruined. After taking our course, Mr. Douglas realized how foolish he had been all those years. It never occurred to him that she enjoyed doing that work and she might really appreciate a compliment on her diligence. One evening after dinner, his wife said she wanted to pull some weeds and invited him to keep her company. He first declined, but then thought better of it and went out after her and began to help her pull weeds. She was visibly pleased, and together they spent an hour in hard work and pleasant conversation. After that he often helped her with the gardening and complimented her on how fine the lawn looked, what a fantastic job she was doing with a yard where the soil was like concrete. Result: a happier life for both because he had learned to look at things from her point of view - even if the subject was only weeds. Seeing things through another person's eyes may ease tensions when personal problems become overwhelming. Elizabeth Novak of New South Wales, Australia, was six weeks late with her car payment. \"On a Friday,\" she reported, \"I received a nasty phone call from the man who was handling my account informing me if I did not come up with $122 by Monday morning I could anticipate further action from the company. I had no way of raising the money over the weekend, so when I received his phone call first thing on Monday morning I expected the worst. Instead of becoming upset I looked at the situation from his point of view. I apologized most sincerely for causing him so much inconvenience and remarked that I must be his most troublesome customer as this was not the first time I was behind in my payments. His tone of voice changed immediately, and he reassured me that I was far from being one of his really troublesome customers. He went on to tell me several examples of how rude his customers sometimes were, how they lied to him and often tried to avoid talking to him at all. I said nothing. I listened and let him pour out his troubles to me. Then, without any suggestion from me, he said it did not matter if I couldn't pay all the money immediately. It would be all right if I paid him $20 by the end of the month and made up the balance whenever it was convenient for me to do so.\" Tomorrow, before asking anyone to put out a fire or buy your product or contribute to your favorite charity, why not pause and close your eyes and try to think the whole thing through from another person's point of view? Ask yourself: \"Why should he or she want to do it?\" True, this will take time, but it will avoid making enemies and will get better results - and with less friction and less shoe leather. \"I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person's office for two hours before an interview,\" said Dean Donham of the Harvard business school, \"than step into that office without a perfectly clear idea of what I was going to say and what that person - from my knowledge of his or her interests and motives - was likely to answer.\" That is so important that I am going to repeat it in italics for the sake of emphasis. I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person's office for two hours before an interview than step into that office without a perfectly clear idea of what I was going to say and what that person- from my knowledge of his or her interests and motives - was likely to answer. If, as a result of reading this book, you get only one thing ' an increased tendency to think always in terms of the other person's point of view, and see things from that person's angle as well as your own - if you get only that one thing from this book, it may easily prove to be one of the stepping-stones of your career.

The bell didn't ' as it hadn't before ' ring. The clapper was too", "label": 1}
{"text": "short and flapped like a boxer punching above his weight class, against a superior reach. None of the caf's occupants looked up. From behind the bar a growling sound issued, but its raw, scratched, larynx splitting timbre said, as well as words, that the growl had been going on long before Seymour's arrival. He hoped it didn't belong to a human. It was hard to tell in Chinatown. He let the door close, and it did so soundlessly, soundless in that its shutting cut out the cacophony of Chinatown's street, behind him. He walked to the bar, looked over it and couldn't see the cook. Instead a dog looked back at Seymour, and shook itself from tail to jowls, keeping stubbornly on with its growling. The dog's hide was as black as its glare. Seymour looked around. All of the diners ate at separate tables, or crouched on high stools next to the counter, and then never next to each other. They were huddled into themselves, not only cloaked in anonymity, but booted and bearded in it. No matter the race, they were of the same species, lost boys who had become lost men. The window to the street was a riot of neon colours that threatened to break in the panes and paint the caf' red. Chinatown never slept. Unless it's sleeping with someone else, thought Seymour, thinking of the brothels, and then thinking; where's the chef? There was another window, an internal one; the one to the kitchen, and a shape passed beyond its yellow-spotted pane. Seymour nodded to himself. The cook's in the kitchen, quelle surprise. The last expression gave Seymour pause. He was reading too much these days. Seymour walked to the kitchen door and opened it. It swung loosely on its hinges, light as the last flight of that desperate boxer, as he was knocked flying and out. There was a smell of hot fat and the sour, broken notes of seeds crushed and scattered on a fire. From within there was the sound of bacon tap-dancing in a pan on the hob, the percussion of eggs next to it, and the blues rhythm of the chef whistling along with the beat of the eggs. Seymour didn't know the score. The chef bent and turned the thick bacon rashers with a spoon, digging them into the pan, jostling them as though commanding them to 'Dance! Dance!', flipping them when they hissed and jived about, excited by the heat. The prodding of the fish-slice into the meat reminded Seymour of the Smile pressed into his scaled belly, making his breathing ragged. Next to the pan a fat bottomed vial was on its own heat, and boiled. Above it, the tight glove of the boss of a clamp held a valve that dripped cyanide into a beaker. The contents of the fat bottomed vial were black and broken, like ground coffee beans, though Seymour knew they were not beans, but seeds. The chef took a swig of unwhitened, gritty-looking coffee and turned to Seymour and smiled, the coffee slipping over his teeth like dirt over buried bones. 'Friend,' said the chef, adding an 'r' to the epithet Noah Cross normally gave him. 'Right with you, right? First I gotta feed Nigger.' The chef scraped the pan on the right hob onto a white plate, where the meat and eggs congealed together looking and gently pulsating like a foetus that should really never have made it to full term. He passed Seymour, went through the door, and, it being still swung open, Seymour watched as he clattered the plate down by the dog, behind the counter. The chef returned. Seymour watched the dog feed, its withered line of neutered penis swinging as its tail wagged. 'Nigger?' 'The world teaches the Nigger to call a spade a spade'' he said, as passed again. '' and that dog's black as the Ace.' \"I don't blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you I would undoubtedly feel just as you do.\" The chef walked to the beakers on the left of the hobs. He looked Seymour up and down and ' with the other eye- looked Seymour up and down further up his body and slightly above his head. 'Ain't sure what kind of thing you are, though, boy.' 'The truth of the Dagon is that there is no truth,' intoned Seymour. 'Well ain't that a helping hand.' The chef returned to his cooking and to hi talking, 'No good pussy pawing around all this stuff, right? I been listening to this speech by a little guy in Germany. A certain Dolf Hitler...' he pronounced the name as three words. 'What he says, he said in that speech. Of... all... the... tasks... we... have... to ' face,... the... noblest... and... most... sacred... for... mankind... is... that... each... racial...species... must... preserve... the ' purity... of... the... blood... which... God... has... given... it.' He smiled. 'Um,' Seymour managed. He had not heard of any Dolfs, let alone heard the speech. 'But you're black.' \"I don't blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you I would undoubtedly feel just as you do.\" He couldn't say it. 'And?' said the chef, letting the eggs burn as he shrugged his way to the vials that bubbled with poison. He lifted an apple that sat, incongruously healthy, on the counter beside the dripping poison. 'And that blackness needs must be protected. I tell you. That Hitler was right. God himself has sanctified the colour of each and every man and I have seen it with mine eyes. Mine own, yeah.' The chef glared at Seymour. Or; at Seymour and at the ceiling. The chef continued, 'I knew this girl in Bakersfield, girl with a butt white as the moon, got her pregnant.' The chef was siphoning off the paste of the cyanide into its beaker. 'That kid, my kid, was going to be an abomination, you know.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I told her I wanted to cut the cord, welcome him into the world, be there for both of them. She was stupidly happy. But I stood there with those clippers ready to sever its mis-coloured throat, stop its mulatto mewling. And you won't guess, but the babe, it came out, the same colour as their swaddle, and the pure little cap, and when they held him up he looked like a rider from the KKK in town to lynch me, holding its own little chord to do the job with. When she held him in her arms, he had the look of a crescent moon, and when she drew back the swaddle for me to cut the cord, his prick was like the teardrop of a star, you know? Fucking miracle I tell you.' \"I don't blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you I would undoubtedly feel just as you do.\" Seymour found, surprised, his right hand curled over the hilt of his Smile. He was not smiling. He thought he must be about to slit the chef's throat and was unsure why. I have got to stop all this reading, he thought. Still, the chef went on, 'For a moment those clippers went toward her throat. The cheating white bitch. She had cheated on me. Must have been. But then I knew. Saw the look of cowish love in her bovine eyes and I knew, knew that there hadn't been another man. Twas God. God had protected the racial colour. Kept the blood line pure. I, and my black blood, had been scrubbed clean of its arteries. Like my seed were white for just that reason. The only touch I had on that little kid, was to cut its chord and be on my way.' The poison was in a syringe, now, and poised above the apple. 'Heard she called it Charlie, had kept her own surname. Both my colour and my name erased like a mistake. Little baby Charlie.' He stabbed with the syringe. 'Eve's apple,' said the chef. 'What you learn off the cunt, eh? Like with that woman back in Bakersfield the things you learn offa them. White as day.' The shaking of his head. A long, lowering whistle. 'You know, it's best for that Charlie he don't know his daddy and don't know the skin on him. Better to be white.' The chef positioned the barrel of the syringe again with cyanide, drew it up and back toward himself, filling up the cylinder. He turned the apple, pressed the tip of the syringe a mere millimetre below the light green, pocked skin, and pressed the needle end down. The apple seemed to pompously swell. The chef eased he needle back out and returned to the skin, on an opposite curve, and pressed in, and injected, and removed, and found another curve of plane, and continued this until the apple swelled close to rupture. 'Your daddy done me good for this,' he said, to Seymour. 'Gonna get me a harem of Queens.' 'Will it kill him?' asked Seymour, nodding at the apple. It was the most he could say. \"I don't blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you I would undoubtedly feel just as you do.\" 'Nah, not a full grown man, maybe a kid, but not a man, not enough from a thousand apples, but it'll slow him down, give him a stomach ache Jonah's whale would have only have known. Make him dizzy, make him puke even. It'll make this more than a fair fight for you, it'll make it fair bit easy for even a fatty to catch up with him.' Seymour ignored this and picked up the apple, placed it in his pocket, swallowed his words and the bile with them and said, 'thanks' and, thankful, left the cafe. 10 - An Appeal That Everybody Likes ' Principle 10 - Appeal to the nobler motives. The girl lay on her side and on the bed, turned away from the wide wooden framed windows that overlooked Cross's ranch. To Seymour, this was a pity, as the courtyard below and hills beyond were a blend of natural beauty nearly equal to her own, in his estimation. They deserved each other. The tall shrub oak in the courtyard was rough, its branches like the ready fingers of an old labourer, caught mid carpentry. The oak was highlighted by ironwood in the niches and hills beyond, lighting it silver with the glow of their boughs, slender and fluted as the screwdriver and lathe in the carpenter's. Birds could be heard, if you paused to notice them (as Seymour did now- not to notice , but because he was finding it hard to say the words he knew he should) their song fattened and made full throated by the warm summer-afternoon air, the Santa Catalinian air. Seymour knew little of land birds, but he recognised the keen of the tern with a twitch. Seymour, being as close to a fish as it was possible for a man to be, knew his seabirds as a mouse is wise to its owls. (To him, the sea tern seemed to call, 'Seymour, Seymour.') And in the rare instances when the land birds and sea birds said nothing, he could hear the island's crickets ' Katydids ' legs scratching out the sound of a high noon's heartbeat. 'Lunchtime,' said Seymour, locating both his larynx and his nerve. Instead of at the window, she stared at the room's corner, where the wallpaper that was, elsewhere in the room, a forest scene, had been yellowed by the angle of the evening sun - where it fell there - and had fronded away from the wall, a process she was apparently aiding with her fingernails. That corner was within reach of the bed. The decay revealed old, soured, blackened wallpaper paint, which left her fingers looking like those of a toddler", "label": 1}
{"text": "in a weed patch; the only black part of her in a body that ranged from white to blonde, if you looked at it from toe to top. Seymour, of course, could not, could not bring himself to do so, but could, finally talk. 'I'm reading a book' ' he said. 'How to Win Friends and Influence People, by Dale Carnegie... I can't believe I'm saying I'm reading a book!' He laughed in hitches that sent his gills spasming. He felt he could be both himself with her and awkward and swollen-hearted. The mixture was intoxicating, like the Angel Faces at his favourite bar. He felt he could tell her everything. 'It says, When we are right, let's try to win people gently and tactfully to our way of thinking, and when we are wrong - and that will be surprisingly often, if we are honest with ourselves - let's admit our mistakes quickly and with enthusiasm.' He didn't need to read this. He blew out his cheeks, which took some time, because they were really quite big. He continued. '' I found you and your mother in Mexico, followed you here, told Mr Cross where you were.' Talking of Mexico, he could hear the troop that played beside and behind the Sheriff's Gold Posse below, in the courtyard, practising alone. Its mix of guitar, banjo, and violin drifted up to the window, along with its timbres of deep, South America and Mexico, and of teak-hardened tradition, and toothless, drooly mouthed whimsy. 'I set Gittes on your trail, and murdered a woman to draw Lieutenant Escobar and Detective Loach onto that same winding, overgrown track. I forced you and your mother out into the open, like little land birds out over the sea, and when you were there, I knew you would fall. I encouraged Loach to want to be the bigger man than his tiny situation and stature, and when he said, 'told you, told you I'd get a bull's eye out on the street,' I agreed, I said there was no bigger bulls eye than your mother, and he laughed like he'd made the joke.' Her eyes seemed glued to the wall, but patchily, their sanity peeling with the paper. 'I did all of this for our father, he's mine too you know, or he might as well be. I did this so daddy would think I had done something in this world.' The cheeks had been blown out, and now it was the turn of a breath in, long and painful and ragged. 'I'm sorry,' he said. 'I'm sorry... You should eat.' He placed the tray. It held two large, metal-mammary-esque covers, like those of a giant robot, and two crystal, flute stemmed glasses, the crystal of which was fractured many times. She turned, but her eyes shied in her head. Seymour didn't blame her. From her angle, he would have appeared multitudinous through the glasses, his image reflected a fly's eyes number of times. One was bad enough, he thought, on reflection. 'Now, Katherine. I'm sorry about this, but Daddy has asked that you have a ' specific meal. One he says will strengthen your constitution, your character.' She frowned and focused, and Seymour removed the covers. Beneath one was a baked rainbow trout with the head left on. Beneath the second was Mrs Mulwray's head. Mr Cross had apparently saved it. Seymour placed the covers delicately on the floor and was considering how he could convey Noah Cross's orders in anything but an indelicate way. 'Um...' he said. 'Daddy has asked that you eat this to... well... feel more a part of your true family. I guess,' he tried, attempting to combat the look of horror moving line by line across her forehead, around her eyes, around her gaping, silently screaming, hyper-ventilating mouth. 'I guess your family will be in you, at least.' He gave a little laugh, but his humour, he was sorry to note, had not lightened her mood. Instead, she said, 'No.' and would not stop. 'Now...' Seymour though of grasping her hands. Gently massaging them. He decided against it, but lowered himself so that he could stare into her eyes. 'Don't worry Katherine. I have a plan.' Her hitching breath was becoming a sobbing sound. 'I asked to eat my lunch with you. This trout. Now, why don't you eat my lunch... we leave the head on, you don't mind do you?.. and I'll eat your mother's face, her head I mean, and nobody need be any wiser.' She was crying. 'Please don't, please not in front of me.' 'Oh,' said Seymour. 'I guess you'd be wiser.' He paused to consider how to help Katherine. 'Please help me,' she said, as though a mind reader. 'I know!' he declared. 'Instead of eating your mother's face in front of you, which I understand might put you off your trout, I'll feed it to the birds outside the window. Out of sight, out of mind,' he added, thinking of Mrs Mulwray's brain. She didn't reply, but her sobbing didn't increase, which Seymour took to be acquiescence, so he hurried to the window, and tore of shreds of skin, then the flesh beneath. It was hard work, like shredding a duck in Chinatown, and his knuckles ached by the time he and the terns had finished. When he returned, however, he was disappointed to see she hadn't even picked at her fish, but had fallen asleep, bundled up against herself, as though slumbering on a cold doorstep, on a winter night. He walked over to her and collected up the plate. He couldn't stay cross with her for long. He smiled softly and ate the trout. 11 - The Movies Do It. Why Don't You Do It?

{"text": "Television does it. And you will have to do it if you want attention. Seymour kept his gaze away from what Daddy called a woman's 'sweetmeats'. The skin of her inner thighs was the smooth, goose-bumped white of milk seen through the condensation of its bottle. Her lower stomach a still saucer. Higher, there was the ripple of motion from her drugged, deep breaths, the curves of her glimpsed breasts bringing to Seymour's mind possibilities; ideas imagined in the sculptor's brain when he ponders the raw material, a wavering of possibility, not yet chiselled, not yet fixed. There were sands at the mouth of the river Inn, near its tidal estuary, which were white under the moonlight, and her skin took Seymour home, to the time in the middle of the night when he would wade in and seek the creatures out there, beyond the reefs, search for them and their probing, clutching tentacles that sought for him. She was the place where all his metaphors met. Home. He laced his bow-tie, dextrous despite his webbing, and pulled the tuxedo jacket in as far as it would come around his stomach and about his flaccid chest. It would need, for this, to be triple breasted, he thought. The suit was tailored but the tailor knew Seymour was not paying, and so had said to Noah Cross ' who was - that it came from the material of two suits. Cross had replied, 'It might as well have come from a three piece suite. Look at the size of you, boy.' Seymour slipped his Smile into the pocket of one of the breasts, leaned over the bed and tugged her silk, white panties up one calf then the other, then over the left thigh, then the right, and over the blonde, long-bleached-grass-in-an-Alabaman-summer mound of her pubic hair. He didn't look, then, there. The bra was a roll of her body to the side (eliciting a snore and a string of drool that remained tethered to the pillow like an anchor-line) and a clasp of her torso to his, followed by a fumble, another fumble, and several more minutes of fumbling. It was like, he thought, getting white mice into denim pockets. He pulled down the petticoat. He pulled up the silk cream dress. He 'dratted' under his breath, pulled down the dress and pushed the petticoat back up to the top of her pubic bone. She said, 'Are you my prince?' She wasn't looking at him but at the bedside lamp so, speaking softly but with his customary drool, he hissed. 'Yes. Prince. That's me. Shhh.' Under the lamp, which cast a halo on its upper hemisphere, was the cyanide apple. The fruit elided the time on the clock, but by what he could see of the minute hand, he cursed. 'Shit; the tights.' They would be late for the premiere and he was worried the chloroform was wearing off. 'Come on, come on,' he whispered to himself. Tights. Petticoat. Dress. Eau de chloroform. Father had never taught him how to put the clothes back on a human woman. High heels. (Not so high she'd slip, nor so low she could run, if she became lucid.) Katydids whirred their legs into life in the gardens and rough grounds of the ranch. Dusk had come to crouch and, it seemed, urinate, over Santa Carolina with the lightest of Pacific squalls; a series of semi-continent spurts. Katherine lolled on the bed, turning and twisting the ends of her limbs; her feet Penguin-sideways/Chaplin-angled, her hands like two pale, slow-writhing fish that had not been properly brained. Seymour steadied her with one hand, grabbed his apple with the other, and shoved the fruit down and into his trouser pocket. He couldn't well leave it, after all. He drew her up and to his bulk, and using the gravity of this, he levered her to the door, coasted her small, white heeled feet down the stairs in a broken record of scratches and bumps, and out onto the drive. A man was waiting inside a Ford de Luxe; a man was always waiting there, ready to serve the estate in the estate sedan- the engine in front of him turning over jerkily. Man, not human, Seymour added to himself. Much of Cross's staff had been replaced, over the last couple of months, as the diaspora of what was left of the People of Dagon had coalesced here in Los Angeles, as a mist might above a marsh, or as mustard gas might in the bronchi. For a long time, Seymour thought, the city had been a new, shiny thing on which he could graffiti a new life. But a past cannot be escaped, and especially one in which Seymour had let a human escape. Seymour didn't approach this car but skirted around the courtyard's walls as if engaged in a well-dressed three-legged race. The Dagon ignored him, anyway, as they always did, of which Seymour was grateful. If Noah Cross knew they were going on their first date, he would have put a stop to it at once. He didn't understand young love, thought Seymour, or any kind of love, for that matter. In the shadows by a wall that would have been white in the day but glowered a ghostly grey, now, he found the car he had parked, earlier. Seymour opened the rear door, and twisted then staved Katherine inside. Seymour walked around the exhaust and got in on the other side. 'Avalon Bay,' he said, to Katherine, and; 'You look beautiful, tonight. I love your clothes. Simple but sophisticated. Straight lines, etc...' He didn't need to look at what she was wearing. He drove; down to the docked SS Catalina, parking on the curve of the waterfront road. Seymour and Katherine got out, walked the line of the wharf, and embarked. The lights on the boats lines (both rigging and curves of the hull) were reflected in the bay but Seymour did not", "label": 1}
{"text": "now, he hunted and the wind circled and wisps of words drifted back from Seymour's prey. 'Berkley University... lucky to have you... God our apartment stinks... Landlord... Lovecraft... shadows... publishing deal... publisher...' and, 'Simon and Schuster'. The phrases may have been clues in a crossword, the solution of which would be where the men were going or how to kill them, but Seymour didn't need them. Noah Cross had told him their destination outright. He may have had ears on the worst street corners of Los Angeles, and in the loftiest echelons of the council, but here, on Santa Catalina, his ears were in the air, in the deep, on the sandy, bluff coloured, palm-tree strewn hills. There was a saying on the island; 'Noah knows.' Those who knew him best, of course, had another saying; 'Cross kills.' At the end of the road sat the theatre, which - with its red tile roof and white-washed walls. If Dagon children were allowed to read poetry it would have recalled to Seymour William Carlos Williams. Most things would have recalled to Seymour William Carlos Williams. He had that kind of mind. He sweated as he stalked, his black, bloodstained shirt now darker and heavier. He always wore black. The bloodstains didn't show, and he rarely laundered. The three Friends entered the arches and then the doors of the Avalon and proceeded down to the theatre. Seymour closed on them, on the stairs, allowing his weight to carry him down on the three at speed. He thought to strike, then to curve around and rescale them, but the steps emptied out onto an atrium, abruptly widening then flattening, leaving him exposed. Breathing heftily, he slowed and stepped back up the crimson carpeting, pretending to have remembered something of importance. Like; murdering humans was bloody hard work. His fingers clasped around the Smile in his pocket. It felt hard, rictus, forced; or soon to be. At the theatre's entrance the Friends showed their tickets to an attendant clothed in the same coagulated blood-crimson colouring as the carpets, as the upholstery. They bought tickets and went in. Momentarily, hands tremoring so that he dropped his dollars then missed his ticket, so did Seymour. Glancing at the ticket, he realised it was for the advert he had seen that morning. Staring, frowning, thinking woozily after all the exertion and stress, this is odd, he saw, [Dale Carnegie- part of the advert] Seymour looked up as the theatre opened up around him. If Avalon Bay was blue sky and blue sea, the innards of the Avalon Theatre were red, red, red. The carpets and seat covers continued the gory note of the corridors. The walls were painted shades of blood, new and old and faded in the sun like a white shirt squirted with lemon then hung out to dry. (It should get the blood out, but it never did, not entirely, hence Seymour's black attire.) It was, in all, like being inside the heart of a pagan god, Seymour thought, like the One that loomed below the bobbing tides off the island, which leaned in when the tide came in and peered at its inhabitants with its many, unfathomable eyes. That waited. The three Friends had arrived early and seemed to be looking for somebody who had not. They talked and if one happened to glance back at Seymour their human eye would tell their human mind to pay Seymour no mind. Somehow, Seymour was most often noticed but almost never seen. It was his ugliness, he reckoned correctly. Seymour glanced left. The diorama on the wall there was of an ancient hunt, the prey already tiled in the terracotta colours of its own blood. Maroon carrion ' silhouetted by a red sun - circled overhead, waiting, and Seymour edged along the seats in that direction, to do the same. He was glad of the rest. He opened the Puzzle Section of his newspaper. Jack Gittes crouches by a run-off pipe and stares down the cliff. Below, Hollis Mulwray stares out at the Pacific Ocean. Seagulls circle. Mulwray bends and picks up a starfish. Part 1 ' Fundamental Techniques in Handling People [crossed through] Humans [in hand-writing] 1. 'If you want to gather honey, don't kick over the beehive' Women talking. 'Look, look.' Then, 'Can you see it, there's three seats there?' 'He might be waiting for friends.' 'Well, it's too late, now, it's about to start. And look at him. Does he look like he's got friends to wait for? He looks like Toad of Toad Hall has died in this heat, in his worst suit, and all swelled up rubbery. I bet he stinks. I'm not sitting next to him. God, you see that woman at the end of the aisle, by the wall- she's trapped! I don't want to end up like that poor gal.' Another of the three tuts but then laughs a throaty, clicking laugh, 'Yeah, but he's not a frog; he's pale, like one of those fish you see dredged up from the deep sea, that never saw the sun. And have you seen how far apart his eyes are?.. And his lips, his lips look like the fish died from shock.' Tuts, laughs. 'Oh My God, he's dribbling. Can you see it? Oh My God, it's going to reach his chest.' Seymour did not have an excess of saliva, but the positioning of his lips, both their pendulousness and their proximity to his chin, meant what liquid pooled within made its way out. He snatched the spittle away with the sleeve of his black shirt. That will stain, he thought. His saliva was closer to opaque than transparent, to yellow than white. He would have blushed if his skin tone could reach red. Instead, Seymour went the puce of an off sausage and found it difficult to breathe. 'Oh! Oh! He can hear us,' said one of the female voices. Their tone lowered, but was still audible. That", "label": 1}

Neither did he look up beyond them ' as they traversed the deck to one of those lover's niches he had seen used but never sat in ' though the night was clear of clouds, he did not look at the constellations above the City of Silver Stars. Tonight, even in the shade of the snug in which he secreted Katherine and wedged himself, she shone enough for him. He stared at her and, apart from propping both her upright and her eyelids open, he did not touch. They and the SS Catalina existed in their own self-reflecting bubble of light. It could not last, of course. The journey would take two hours. When Noah Cross found out, Seymour wouldn't be allowed time with her again. For her part, Katherine whispered, 'My what big teeth you have'' The chloroform, it seemed, had put her in a fairy-tale frame of mind. '' Grandma.' Seymour's Grandma was back home. Dead and buried, the house TNT blasted. It had been an old house in the old town district of Innsmouth. Gambrel roofed, rust-red cellar, and she had sat by the wide, bay windows. She'd had big teeth, too, especially the canines, which were long and sharp, both unlike a human's and liking human. Out on the deck adjacent to them, le Grande Midgetian added to the magic and Seymour listened to the sound of him and his disappearing pommes routine, followed by the saltpetre bang of the Midgetian's own disappearance. The ferry docked, the passengers found their cars on the wharf below, and the air began to smell of exhaust and oil. Seymour walked Katherine off the wharf to where he had parked her mother's Packard. Seymour drove north until they reached Wilshire Boulevard. All of the city appeared to be heading the same way, so he stopped as soon as he saw a space long enough. The pedestrians and the air about them frothed past the Packard as he killed the engine. The evening was a bubble bath of excited speech bubbles, the pedestrians bobbing below their own words as though tethered to them, carried up the pavement toward the Carthay Circle Cinema, the tower and the bell at its top lit up at the boulevard's end. [speech bubbles ; yeah, Marlene Dietrich, Cary Grant, Betty Miller, Wow, Walt Disney, Pow, Yeah, YEAH] If Seymour had been tied to one of the bubbles, if the magic of the evening hadn't left him unable to speak, he would have been a terrible tether, and would instead have bobbed above all the hubbub, carrying it forever upward. The first date - his first trip to the cinema - did not surpass all his imaginations (the images he sweatily saw, late at night, were extreme and as depraved as you might expect of a Dagon) but it did reach parts of him he didn't know existed; his heart, and the pheromones in his blood, which rose high, higher than the babble of public excitement, which soared. He gripped Katherine's hand. She moaned in reply, but not in excitement. Above the door to the Circle Cinema, in bold font surrounded by circling bulbs, Walt Disney took top billing, followed by, [as above description, with Snow White and the Seven Dwarves'] There was a privileged excitement to all this. The night was not only rarefied by the prospect of a film that would carry all cinema before it, less a new wave than a tsunami, but an awareness of the audience's part in its moment. Visible beside the theatre were stages built to contain the masses who could not get a ticket. Those that could were the great and the good. They would rub popcorn cartons with film stars, be served at the bar before household names, shit in cubicles next to celebrities. Seymour looked across at the gathering crowd sat on the assembled bleachers across the boulevard. The fashion of the crowd was high '37, perhaps even early '38. Even the non-entrants were trendsetters. Men in pinstriped suits but more often tuxes. The women; oh, the women were all of the highest style, elegant angular fashion, new-fangled fake eyelashes, hair up and off the ears, heels higher than Seymour's sock-line, slim line cigars and jewellery the size of the Smile in his pocket. Many wore tight, tall black hats in a nod to the lengthening nights, the men scarves against the lowering temperatures. Carried by the excitement, Seymour and Katherine joined the stream of humans that had itself joined a river. Around the Carthay Circle Theatre, cars stopped and blared their horns. Policemen prowled. There was a canopy leading up to the entrance below both the tower and the gyrating lights, beneath which the bulbs of cameramen popped like the speech bubbles on the street, but brighter, and the brightness of celebrities caught the eye, here and there between the press and under the canvas. Stars you can follow, thought Seymour. 'Crumbs in the wood,' mumbled Katherine. 'Leading you deeper, darker...' Seymour couldn't help but feel hers was the better metaphor. 'Yes,' he said. The policemen shadowed the celebrities and glared at their public. The flatfoots were walking toward him. He owns the police, Seymour recalled, of Noah Cross. Breathing heftily, he pulled Katherine left, going with the direction of her loll and stopped ' abruptly- as they stumbled into the midst of a dwarven village. 'Yes,' yes'' muttered Katherine. 'This is expected.' The village had mushroomed up from the ground, organically; seemingly grown more than sculpted of wood: a mill, a bridge, seven dwarves. Just as abruptly, Seymour realised the dwarves were not whittled ' were not part of the movie scene- but were whistling, and moving as they did so, moving toward them, and shouting, in a sing-song fashion. 'Hey.' 'Hey.' Seconded another. 'Hi!' said a third. 'Ho,' said a fourth,", "label": 1}
{"text": "but sotto. The village was part of the night, part of the fantasy of it all, of Disney's great attraction, but Seymour and attraction were as much an alien concept as Cthulhu, and he wanted anything other than to be here, at the centre of attention. The dwarves surrounded them. Seymour twisted about, looking for a way out of the village other than back to the policeman or over its bridge, and Katherine swung with him, in his arms. 'Hey, it's Snow White!' 'Nah,' one of them leered up at them. It seemed to have little choice in the leer; its face being made out of some kind of soft, plush, cushion of fabric. 'This one's whiter than Snow White.' 'Snowier than whiter than snow white, did you say?' said a dwarf with glasses. 'Nah! White-ier than snowier than white-ier than Snow White!' 'Listen,' said Seymour, but they were dancing about him, with all the jollity of a slave-gang-line that had been recently ' and mistakenly, in Seymour's opinion - freed. They were singing, 'Hi, ho Hi, ho, It's good to see you Snow, With a deformed ape, Who likes to rape. Hi Ho Hi Ho Hi Ho Hi Ho,' And again, 'Hi Ho, Hi Ho, It's off to fuck you go, With a pale skinned maid, Dick shaped like a spade, Hi Ho Hi Ho Hi Ho Hi Ho'' Their fake beards trailed them as they leapt. 'No'' moaned Katherine as they danced her toward the mill. 'Hi Ho, We dance to raise our dough,' Then, 'No!' Seymour thought it had been him who'd said it. He'd meant to. Instead, a bespectacled dwarf with the brown tabard shoved forward, grasped Katherine by the candle-white taper of her forearm, pulled her quickly back, with Seymour with her. 'No!' he added in a hiss. 'What's up, Doc?' said the beardless dwarf. He made a quick slapping sound with the human lips that could be seen between the fat cartoon lips, as though eating a carrot that wasn't there. 'I've told you not to say that! Especially not around Mr Disney!' 'He's not here! Go on - what's up?' 'You! You! All of you! That's not the song Mr Disney asked us to sing. You, you're all making us look like what everything thinks we dwarves are. Little lecherous men, lustful little men' little, little men! Next thing you'll be getting naked and fucking cavorting. Stop it, stop it now. I've fought against this my whole life. I'm a fucking serious actor. Serious, get it, I've done Macbeth. Midsummer's Night Dream. I've been Puck.' 'What the Puck?' replied the original dwarf. 'Dearie me, you do look serious, doc, with that frown' and that fake beard' and those leprechaun clothes'' 'Just stop it!' 'Doc's orders!' Laughter. Seymour felt his eyes were agog, and his brain behind them, and his mouth below both. In the absence of anything coming out, he gulped. 'Why what's that you've got in your pocket, Mr Deformed Ape? Either it's fruit or you're pleased to see me.' 'It's a Cox,' said Seymour. ''an Apple!' he managed. Pop, Flash. The fizz and explosion of the cameras would have eked warmth even through the cold December air, would have warmed Seymour's face, if it were not already hot from his unguarded 'Cox'. The dwarves turned from him as a photographer shouted, 'Look, it's Funny-Man Milton Berle!' Pop. Flash. Pop. Flash. A man with teeth and eyes almost as white as the camera's flash, and eyebrows thick and well-drawn as the smile of an upside down cartoon cat strode into the dwarven village, and picked up the dwarf they called 'Doc'. Seymour ' who had never seen a movie - didn't recognise the Funny-Man Milton Berle. The man laughed and shouted back at the gathering constellation of popping flashbulbs. 'Hey, these must be the seven gnomes I've heard all about. Right, gnomes?' 'No,' shouted the dwarves. 'That's what I said, gnomes,' said Funny-Man Milton Berle. The press laughed. 'It should have been called Snow White and the Seven Gnomes, right gnomes?' 'Yes,' shouted the dwarves, except Doc, whose 'get the fuck off me' was lost in the laughter. 'Hey Funny-Man!' said a reporter, pad and pen in hand instead of a camera. He stood a foot higher than the dwarves, but only, noticed Seymour, because he was the meat in a Cubans and Fedora sandwich. 'Jerry Rodgers, reporter for the L.A. Times. Funny-Man, when are you going say something funny?' The crowd (which now surrounded Seymour) 'oo'd and 'boo'd. 'Why Jerry, I got one,' said Milton Berle, holding Doc a little higher. 'Jerry Rodgers. Punchline; reporter.' Jerry had gone the colour of his Cubans, forehead further mottling with rage. 'Only joking Jerry,' said Funny-Man. 'With your looks you could be a movie star.' He hoisted the dwarf. 'Like one of these guys.' 'I'm an award winning journalist,' began Jerry Rodgers. 'Yeah, I heard,' interrupted Milton Berle. 'That's when I said, 'Why are we honouring this man? Have we run out of human beings?'' Seymour flinched and carried the action into a crabbing, sideways shuffle, away from Berle and the flashing lights, through the press of people. As he left, Jerry seemed to be scribbling a series of short words, each no more than four letters. Seymour pushed through to the back of the crowd, across the dirtied red carpet and into the foyer of the Circle. 'Walt Disney and Marlene Dietrich!' Seymour was too tired from carrying Katherine to do more than glance, sweating as heavily as he breathed, he made for the foyer's door. 'It's Mr Disney! It's Marlene Dietrich!' He had a short, dark moustache, and she shoulder length, platinum hair which carried its colour through her dress. 'Mr Disney, sir, over here!' The cries went up and sideways and zigzagged around the flashbulbs, until their lines were snipped by the closing of the foyer's door. Seymour leant against it, breath quick, breathing, breathing, concentrating on breathing for a moment,", "label": 1}
{"text": "with Katherine's weight on him. Their date wasn't going as he had hoped. He must have used too much chloroform. A man walked their way, heavy set in the way Seymour was, but taller, and talking in a deeper timbre, 'You have your ticket, sir?' The human's stature and voice said 'manly' just as surely as Seymour's said 'fishy'. His tone suggested there was 'something suspicious' about Seymour. 'Here.' Seymour dug with his left hand, then thrust it out at an angle. He was tiring, his patience and abductor muscles stretched. 'Is she..?' 'Those tickets are fine,' said Seymour. Nothing was further from his mind than 'How to Win Friends and Influence People'. 'Yeah, but is'' 'You know whose name those tickets were bought under?' '' No' 'Noah Cross. You can check it, if you'd like.' 'Oh no' No need, sir. Through you go sir.' 'Thank you,' Seymour said Seymour walked Katherine across an octagonal, ochre and white tiled floor, past a clutch of faux Grecian pillars. He turned them both right, and ' with a tired sigh - sat Katherine in a booth, behind a small circular table. As if agreeing with his exhalation, she snored once, but long and loud. A nearby table- the room was filling but not yet full, most of the tide of patrons still outside- looked up. Seymour nodded at Katherine. 'Quite right, dear,' he said. And, 'I couldn't have put it better myself.' Katherine opened her eyes, glared at him, and slurred, 'Troll looks.' 'Yes, dear,' said Seymour, glancing about the room, thinking, No, not at all, actually. He didn't need to focus on the particulars of the people on the tables nearby to know they were all more attractive, more successful, and less likely to live under a bridge frightening passing goats than he was. She slumped toward the table, and Seymour grasped her arm. Touching the drugged Katherine felt wrong. Golden haired, pearl-skinned, she was sacrosanct. Only his God's tentacles were supposed to hold (then pierce, then impregnate) her body. He lowered her gently to the table-top. Seymour rose, made a rough swigging air-drawing to the room, and went to the bar, where he ordered three glasses of white wine, a lager, a Martini, and a cola, for him. Returning with the tray, he placed these on the table, removing Katherine's head from the same (where it had been drooling) and surreptitiously poured the contents of all but the cola on the carpet between their feet. Surrounded by discarded glasses of alcohol, nobody gave their table more than a second glance or a comment beyond 'look at that alcie, she's outta it'. The tide came in, pooled, rushed on to the cinema in waves and waving and calling 'over here Greta,' or, 'Hey, Mr Gable'. Seymour lifted Katherine and allowed them to be carried in with it, the press helping with the weight on his right arm. The name Noah Cross could get them any seat in the house, bar the front row. Seymour had picked the back and so did not have to tumble down the incline of the aisles, but he had to push past knees and, at one point, retrieve a fallen Katherine from a ladies lap. He 'sorried' along the line, mindful of Part 3 chapter 3, until they reached their seats. The lights went down, the curtains sideways, the screen turned on. 'Gable's in front of us,' said a voice beside Seymour. The woman there, wearing what could (if Seymour could judge such a thing) have been the least fashionable hat in the house, spoke to her friend, pointing at a head with hair that glistened, as though the screen were projecting on him. He shone, but only at his extremes, the rest silhouetted; a cloud with a silver-screen lining. Next to him sat the woman who had stood beside Walt Disney, on the red carpet. Marlene! they had shouted. Miss Dietrich! She turned to Clark Gable and spoke in a gabbled voice that didn't seem to recognise the need for finger spaces between its words. 'Didn't see you in the line, Clark.' Clark Gable shook his head, which glittered. When he spoke, the spaces between his words were asymmetrically big, as though he had stolen hers. 'Oh, no, couldn't be bothered with all that. Had to sneak in.' 'I heard about Jean, I'm sorry.' Clark Gable nodded as the audience hushed. 'It's a great pity. She's... She was a grand girl.' 'She died during filming?' 'Yeah, Saratoga.' Gable's words were lowering to a harsh whisper, as human's do when they were about to weep, or wanted to stop talking. Marlene did the latter. On the screen, the credits appeared, written over a brown, scaly background, the colour and shape of the flakiness on Seymour's skin. Snow White danced onto the screening, singing, watched by her step-mother, but not by Seymour. Snow White seemed to Seymour as she was, in fact; two -dimensional; fictional. He didn't know what the fuss was about. Instead, he stared at Katherine, who began to snore softly, though her eyes were open. The woman next to him turned and stared. 'Too much drugs,' said Seymour, by way of an explanation. The woman's stare narrowed and, nervous, Seymour began to fiddle with the fruit in his pocket. The woman looked away and shifted away as far as her seat would allow. Sometime later, the two-dimensional woman in the movie died and Clark Gable, along with several other audience members, began to cry. Seymour yawned. It was all a little melodramatic for his taste. Bored, he retrieved the apple and studied it hopefully. There was a gasp from the seat next to him. Peering over the cyanide-ripened curve of the fruit, Seymour smiled it what he hoped was a reassuring way. It wasn't. The woman drew in a breath long enough to be a scream on its way out, but passed out, instead. Shaking his head, Seymour reached across in one of the", "label": 1}

[In white font on black, with the black clouded and smoky at the edges] As he became a teenager he lost most of his hair and put on fat around his abdomen so that he could no longer find the outline of the child he used to be. As an adolescent he sat on the cliff edge. As he got older he seemed to find himself further and further from the sea and nearer to the edge. He had been crying. There was more than the normal measure of moisture in his eyes. He stared unflinchingly into the Atlantic breeze and filled his sight with the ocean, allowing his thoughts to drift out with it except for one' push yourself off, you don't deserve to go on' It was then that he saw the shape, a line becoming a curve, a tentacle waving to him. He smiled and, whenever he remembered her, would do so again. 12 - When Nothing Else Works, Try This 'Go ahead, punch me.' Noah Cross pushed his face, pendulous lips, small, slitted eyes, and all, forward and down; closer to where Seymour crouched. 'Didn't you understand me, fiend? Punch me.' Cross was clear - not as crystal but as present danger ' though he didn't speak in English, nor even in human. He spoke Dagon, a filthy, heavy, bloated, bleared tongue, like that of a rotting fish, a kind of nautical slang of a language, like that sharks might heckle and threaten in. His fist hung above Seymour, ready to be thrown down. Seymour had been reading much about throwing down the gauntlet, recently, but remembered none of the contents of Chapter 12. If Cross's fist was a gauntlet, thought Seymour, it was burnished at the knuckles, polished by the repeated application of Seymour's face. Like his simile, it was heavy-handed. 'What are you? A waste. A disappointment. After all of my charity you almost ruin everything by taking her to the ' to the fucking movies.' Of course, in Dagon, the swearword wasn't fucking but the kind of intercourse you might imagine between demons in the form of fish. It was, at the least, incestuous. 'Show some back bone you bottom feeder, and hit me! Hit me!' Cross didn't wait for this, his fist slipping a little on Seymour's greasy scalp as it struck. The pain it set off in Seymour's head echoed, repeated, reverberated, echoed again. Echoed again. It didn't help that there was a hollow in Seymour, and always had been. 'I couldn't,' Seymour said. 'I couldn't hit you. I couldn't'' he was lying, now, not with the words ' he couldn't do this, either, not to Cross- but on the floor. They had nights like these, every month or so (as often as a human woman's period, Seymour calculated, and just as bloody), when everything Seymour suspected others thought of him was spoken out loud. It was relieving to be told the faults he secretly knew riddled his personality, or that he could see openly in the mirror. He recalled Snow White, 'Mirror, mirror on the wall,' he tried to mumble, but, instead of the words, there were red ribbons of blood in his mouth. He felt as though he were unspooling. The man he sometimes ' not in these times- knew as Daddy lent in. 'You know what I do to people I love, don't you? Eh' No? I make love to them. I loved my daughter, Evelyn, and I love Katherine. I love Katherine because she's my daughter. You... you... I can't make love to you, son. I'm not a pervert. So what good are you? And you do this. You risk my daughter, you risk my granddaughter, for a shitting trip to the movies?' The floor tiles were a cool, congealing rag against his cheek, against the bruises Cross had given him. Not far from his face, his valise had been knocked on its side and was open, mealy mouthed, midway through saying, perhaps, 'I can't help you, I don't know why you thought I could save you'. Scattered from it, like so many words, were some of the greatest works of fiction written by the hands of humans. Wuthering Heights. Frankenstein. Moby Dick. Mansfield Park. The Scarlet Letter. The Waste Land. Leaves of Grass. And, nearest to Seymour, the first, orange edition of How to Win Friends and Influence People. Seymour had returned from the movie theatre to find his room not turned upside down but thrown sideways, every draw open, paperwork across the floor, his valise on its side. Cross, once apparently hearing from one of his many nearly-men that Seymour had taken Katherine out, had seethed through his room like a vengeful ifreet, spouting fire and seeking Seymour's ruin. Seymour was still wearing his tuxedo. On the tiles, the tomes vibrated as Cross walked away and returned with (from the shadows that stretched out across the terracotta squares) a candlestick in his hand. The ochre tiles themselves glowered and gloamed as the candle neared. They knew what was coming. 'It's this.' Cross did not deign to touch the books. 'This is the problem. You failed your people when you couldn't get your fat arse through a door frame and kill one, single, meek reed of a human being. This,' the candle guttered as it was lowered into Seymour's sight, above Carnegie's text. 'Reading was supposed to make you strong, make you a success, but you've taken it too far. Now it's made you soft and stupid as the human tongue.' He splayed a webbed hand over Leaves of Grass. He set fire to The Waste Land, and then set this book against the other, the fire catching. 'Poetry? Poetry? What place does that have in the real world? How is poetry ever something that is successful, in any way? That wasn't my recommendation, was it, boy? You're not one of us, now,", "label": 1}

Look at you, down there bleeding and smelling and feeling shitting sorry for yourself. That, I don't mind. It's feeling sorry for other people I can't stand.' He spat the 'people', as he did the next word. 'Pathetic!' Seymour, who had been breathing in huffs, constricted his breath, so as not to accidentally blow out what Cross was doing. The bow-tie about his throat helped in this constriction. 'No.' His voice tremored. 'No I'm Dagon. Dagon from my gills to my webbed feet.' Seymour's chest tightened on the floor. There, his moobs were cushions against the tiles, but not against the impact of Cross's blows. A kick, shortened by Cross's trick hip, clipped Seymour on the back of his skull. He winced and sobbed, once and high-sounding ' nearly a shriek- and the world, when the wince had ceased and he could open his eyes, was reeling, all the furniture and the room rolling past his sight as though he were on the deck of a downing ship. 'Dagon,' he managed. 'Prove it.' Cross, as it was with these times, had none of his candour or charm. Instead, his whisper was a sharp chill and high heat in Seymour's ear, like a spike of fever driven into his brain. 'How many times do I need to tell you of a human who is spreading the word of us? How long do you want to give him to alert his fellow kin to our presence among them, or the presence in their seas? How can you not see how dangerous Derleth is?' The blows came again, as the fire spread to Mansfield Park, and with them came Cross's own words, separating now, as red leaves do on an Autumnal breeze. Failure. Son. Failure. A list, ever since 'How to Win Friends and Influence People', Seymour had been partial to lists: a kick to the ribcage, punch to the right cheek, kick to the left upper spine. Leaves of Grass hissed as it burnt, The Waste Land sputtered once. Frankenstein required three ignitions to get started, the flames licking up, 'Accursed creator! Why did you form a monster so hideous even YOU turned from me in disgust?' and blackening the page around 'I am' so that the words were left alone in the dark. 'I'll kill him...' whispered Seymour, of August. A further list: a long blunt object (possibly a cane) set to his buttocks, twice, then the dip between his skull and then to his twisted, hunched back. '' I promise...' The candle lay sideways, wick dipped in seeming defeat. Under it, the Scarlet Letter began to burn. The wax on the top of the stem looked, to Seymour, like a shattered back. How to Win Friends and Influence People's orange spine blackened and curled. Amid the flames, Seymour thought, yes I still have the green one. And... '' I promise... Daddy...' A final list: blows to various points on Seymour's upper back, then skull, the precise points of impact lost in unconsciousness. Consciousness came back, with the last of the red flames embering on fragments of a page that seemed to be crawling like red and black backed beetles away from each other. Then he was falling. Fiend.

In A Nutshell - Win People To Your Way Of Thinking Seymour walked across the main street to the grocers, carrying a black-board. Under his right hand it read in four lines of Snow-White chalk, [Portrait advert ' 'Last Cox of the Harvest - One Bite All Dreams Come True' Bent double with remembered and present pain, he V'd open the advert, upended the V, plonked it down on the sidewalk next to a window filled with levels of bagged rice. Close reader that he now was, Seymour noticed the 'Last' had lost its 'L' and 't'. He lifted his hands and upturned them into the shape of dead spiders. The fingers of the right were whiter than even their normal dead-fish-pallor. The chalk had coagulated in places, mixed with sweat. He wiped the mayonnaise-gloop onto his black trousers. As soon as he raised his hands, they were wet again, already. Terror, he thought. His vision tremored with it, he added, until he realised it was the hands that were doing the palsying. Wrapping the wide white cuffs of his unbuttoned sleeves around his palms, so that they seemed to be mummified, he extracted the chalk from his trouser pocket and reapplied the 'L' and 't'. Bent over, he worked frantically with the top of his pants and crack between his buttocks exposed to the street, black-jacketed back beetled up, thinking dung beetles probably had easier jobs to do. The thought was compacted by the smell of Chinatown, which around here was predominantly faeces. It might be me. Seymour still wore the suit of two nights before, having been unable to remove it due to the swelling and blistering inflicted by Cross's fists. He had considered scissoring off the jacket, before realising", "label": 1}
{"text": "that, once it was removed, he wouldn't be able to recover his swollen skin. He was now at what he labelled 'peak bruise'; purple and painful but there was no rest for the wicked, or even for failures who were supposed to be wicked but could barely pull off mildly immoral. Things to do, people to poison. Seymour had driven in and parked Evelyn's Packard in the alley opposite, beside the store Cross's ears-on-the-street said August bought most of his groceries. At the end of the alley was August Derleth, Mark Scorer, and Donald Wandrei's fire-holed apartment. Driving had been an agony - which wasn't to say much, given everything was pain - his arms and legs as limber as a stick insect. (Getting out of the car, he had entreated Cthulhu to put an end to him, putting the 'praying' in Praying Mantis, though certainly, he thought, not the 'man'.) Unable to bend at many of his joints, Seymour didn't need to straighten, but forced himself more vertical than horizontal and scuttled back to the sidewalk opposite, where he had sat, before, in the shade at a table overlooking the store. He had positioned the table and an extra chair opposite him, along with a drink to make pedestrians think he entertained a guest. On the chair, in fact, lay two more chalk boards, both bearing the same advert. Under the chalk boards, hidden, sat his valise, half burnt and browner than before. Inside the valise, two unburnt pages of Leaves of Grass sat next to a book that, scorched, read 'The Waste La', and on top of what was left of 'Frank'. Under the chair opposite him were seven brown paper bags of apples; all of the store's stock. Above his droop-ended moob, his left breast pocket was pert with the outline of a poisoned apple, nippled by the stalk. Opposite this, leering in the right breast pocket, was his Smile. Sitting beneath the tail-end of the vertically hung, neon COCKTAILS sign, Seymour sipped an Angel Face and made paw-prints of sweat on the cool table top, wet crescent moons for his palms and tide-lines that were his fingers. He raised his hands and blew on them, watching the street between his fingers. Still, he sweated. He leant back, scanning left, then right, rubbing his palms against the greasy back of his hair. This didn't help. He couldn't see August. The apple in his jacket pocket felt, somehow, loaded. The chemical processes must have preserved it, blushing its skin for several days, but it had now started to brown. No matter, Seymour convinced himself, the last apple of the harvest would not be flawless. He sipped. Seymour ordered another. Sip, sweat, watch, wait, sweat some more. The shadows of the street shortened toward noon, disappeared as the sun sat overhead like the head of a pin (spiking them down, stavened on a butterfly-display) then lengthened again. For some time, he needed to urinate. Unable to leave, he did so down the left leg of his black trousers. It pooled against his shoe and the table foot. It did little to alter his aroma. As the shadows of the main street switched sides, the owner of the store stepped out of its front door, a broom held between both hands. He swept, before running the brush up against the advertising hoarding, and pausing, broom held tighter. Seymour sighed, raising his hand into a flat salute above his eyebrows, scanning the street. Still no August. Shaking his head ' the brush end of the broom wiggling ' the store owner grabbed the black board, looked angrily up and down the street and strode back into the deepened shadows of the building. There was clatter from within. 'Another?' asked the barman, nasally, standing several feet away. It wasn't the barman from before, with his porcine snout. This server had more than enough nasal passage to sound snotty. Seymour didn't blame him for pushing the words out through his nose. It would stop the stench coming in. 'Where's the other barman?' asked Seymour. The wrinkle of the human's nose continued up into his forehead, crinkling it into a frowned, silent 'Who?' Seymour waved a hand over his own face. 'He had a funny look'' The new barman stared at Seymour's features. '' you know, like a pig.' 'Oh.' The barman looked away, his eyes seeming glad to do so. 'You mean Randall. He just left, walked out before his shift was over. Said he'd had it with Chinatown, was moving to the country.' The barman tried to move the conversation along to its terminus. 'A drink, sir?' Seymour didn't answer, tilting himself so that he could see left, then right, as if crossing on a main thoroughfare. A man and his boy approached the store, the boy's curling brunette hair bouncing at his father's hips as he said, audible both to the height of his father's ears and, here, across the street, 'Run daddy? Run, please? Maybe race?' The father, half a head taller even than Seymour, and far above the boy, smiled down at him. Somehow, it reached, and seemed to send highlights glinting through not only the boy's eyes, but also his hair. The father, though, shook his head, which he then nodded toward the grocery store. Despite the lack of a race, the boy smiled back up at him, big as he could in order for the grin to reach all the way to his father's face. They entered the shop's shade, the father's walk that of a man who had lived- just about- through the Great Depression; a long, loping stride and roll of the shoulders that used as little energy as possible. He wouldn't know, Seymour guessed sipping his drink, when he would eat up the last of his reserves, or when he would eat next. His new denim work shirt ' a clean curacao blue like the bay off Avalon - said life was turning up,", "label": 1}
{"text": "but that upturn had not travelled all the way down to his feet, which were shod in the mummified parts of different half dissolved shoes, bastard sandals of no distinct origin. All of the boy's clothes were new. Then, father and son were gone into the shadows. There was an exasperated breath, rasping because it was not allowed to go down the nose. Then, a repeated question. 'Sir?' Seymour nodded as he rose. He crabbed his fingers around the frame of the next advertising board, careful to avoid the chalk, crossed the street between a Ford and a GM, replaced the signage, turned to hurry back to his seat. Foot dangling of the pavement, he stopped. August Derleth. Back-peddling toward the store, Seymour bumped into a white-suited, Fedora-hatted man, whose lips curled ready to curse, but were quickly cupped by the man's hand. He looked, to Seymour, as though he had been a little sick into his palm. His eyes glistened. 'Christ,' he managed. Seymour slipped past him into the grocers. It was cool and dark and his shoes (which had once been smart) came to a clip-clopping stop on the tiles. Seymour looked left-right, then straight ahead down the aisles. The boy and his father were stood before the fridges, the boy holding the low-hanging, brown, ear-rim-like shape of his father's hand. The boy said, 'Can I have it?' 'Maybe.' 'Please Daddy?' 'May' Be.' The father's face, turned away from his son, smiled through the ellipse ' quick, so his son wouldn't see it. 'If you eat some fruit first, maybe.' This 'maybe' sounded surer, so that the boy smiled also, but without guile. 'Can I have an apple, please, Daddy? Please?' His father laughed when he saw the smile. 'Sure, son.' A hand on his hair, moving back and forth. 'Eat as much apple as you want. Good for you.' 'Thank you Daddy.' Two thoughts: Daddy. August. Seymour strode to the empty basket of apples at the back of the store. He looked to the fascia's windows. August was there, but not looking in, staring, instead, across the front of the shop. Derleth turned into the front entrance. Seymour didn't need to duck, beetled by deformity as he was, and maggoted his fingers around the curve of the apple inside the black, musty cloth of his breast pocket. His fingers jammed, stuck in crooked lines against each other. He pushed. The pocket ripped a little. August's footfalls were the heavy heart beats Seymour would have been able to feel, were it not for the thick insulation of his chest-fat. Still, the apple would not roll free. 'Hey! Miss Ter!' It sounded to Seymour like three separate words. The store owner had left his till and was pointing at him with the end of his broom. Derleth could be heard in the adjoining aisle. One of his shoes made a clean high sound on the tiles, the other was flatter, as though the sole had been holed by so much walking. It was, to Seymour, like a tick, then a tock. The sound repeated. The outline of the apple bulged into the tease of a mammary. 'Comeon,' said Seymour. There wasn't time for two separate words. It just' It just wouldn't' Then, with a riiiip, it did. August was at the end of the aisle on his right. On his left, the store owner closed. Riiiip. Pop. The apple came free in a rush, and an upended parabolic arc, and a bounce, and a roll along the ground. Feeling as Adam must have felt, Seymour suddenly saw everything too clearly. The apple rolled past August, who had turned the broccoli-end of his aisle, who now stared at and recognised Seymour. It rolled past his walk-battered shoes, under the next rank of shelving, to the aisle beyond, and close enough to two small feet. 'No,' said Seymour, clearly. 'Get out,' said the store owner, as though they were holding a conversation in reverse. Joining in, August said 'yes' and would have, but he slipped on the sole of his worn shoe ' the right- and fell into a shelf of tined sardines. They clattered around him, glinting like a catch falling from overloaded nets, and one tin cracked, spurting the tomato juice they were marinated in. August tried to rise but slipped on the red. 'Look, apple, Daddy.' There was the sound- Seymour was sure he didn't imagine it ' of a small hand slipping from a big hand and then the sound, clear as rain, but not right, no, not in any way, of the pitter patter of tiny feet. 'Daddy,' said Seymour, appalled. 'Get...' said the store owner. Seymour dodged right, pain ratcheting his spine as he twisted past the store owner, down the aisle. He slipped on the sardines around August, kicking them away. Derleth stared up at him, painted red across his legs, his chest, red as the centre of bulls-eyes Seymour no longer saw. 'Poison!' Seymour tried to shout but it came out as 'Oi! Son!' 'Son,' the father was saying. 'Little man, come back please. We have to pay for that first. Little man!' Seymour rounded August, skidded round the shelving. Seymour stared. The aisle was empty. Momentarily he thought the boy was a ghost, already. The store owner hit him with the broom. He didn't notice even the numb pain through the layer of back-fat. Seymour staggered toward the next aisle. Seymour put his hand inside the curve of his dress jacket. Opposite pocket. He drew his Smile. The store keeper drew back. Beyond the blade's curve, right on the horizon at the edge of his sight, he caught a glimpse of a pale arm, between boxes of cereal, an arm white and thin enough to make him think, momentarily, of pouring milk. The arm was grasping an object which was out of sight, but central to his mind's eye. 'Put that apple down, now. Right now. We haven't paid for it.' The", "label": 1}
{"text": "last of his vowels were drawn out, exasperated. Crunch; a sound clean as the breaking of ice, and wet, as wet as the metabolised cyanide just below its surface. Seymour closed his eyes. He would have sheathed his Smile to put his hands over his ears but didn't have time. Crunch. Crunch. The father was striding, but not running, and not for the right reasons. 'Little man, how many times have I told you we have to pay for things first?'` The boy tried to reply. 'Sorry,' Seymour guessed, by the sibilance that began the words and would not stop. The 's' went on and on, and became wet, and bubbly. The boy went down, with a writhing clump clump clump of his arms fitting against the floor, and with the slight, italicised splatter of froth hissing from his lips. 'Not enough to kill a full grown man, oh, no.' 'My boy!' An arm flapped out from the end of the aisle, pale, tapered, fitting. It stopped. 'Wha..?' The scattering roll of the father knocking the apple away. The father screamed. Not yet with despair, but this simple agony. He had his fingers between the boy's gnashing teeth, Seymour knew, and would be scooping out Snow White apple flesh. Little good it would do. The cyanide was in. 'Waaaarargh'' the father's 'what' had stretched into a scream. 'What have you done?' the store owner whispered from somewhere back there in the shadows, completing the question when nobody else in the store was able to do so. He - the store owner - must have seen a look on Seymour's face that went beyond the hitman's normal inhumanity. A look that said; I'm a monster. Seymour could not help looking at that one white arm. It was utterly still, now. Seymour, his own limbs palsying, could not move or reply but in shakes. Then, allowing the palsy to move him, first a little finger, then an arm, then his legs, he ran in a judder from the store and into the street, knocking a woman onto the road. There was a beeeeep and a screech that sounded like it might be a high-pitched scream inside his mind. There, he heard the store owner's question, again, when all anybody in the outside was saying was, 'You idiot!' 'Look at that madman!' 'Fuck off outta the way.' What have you done? Seymour went right then right again, into the alley. 'Right, right,' he muttered, when he didn't feel it was at all. He vomited against the wall, then punched it, along with the vomit. 'Daddy,' he said, and punched the bile as if it were his surrogate father. He didn't know why the death of a human, and one no more than a child, would afflict him like this, but he couldn't stop punching. His knuckles slipped, then he did, into the refuse that skirted the alley. 'Daddy!' He turned away from the wall and found his car. He clambered in, started the engine and pulled out into the main street without looking. There was nothing unusual about this and nobody paid it ' or his erratic driving- any attention. He drove. When he hit the coast, he took an abrupt left into the sea. Nobody saw Seymour doing this. The Packard plummeted several feet, hit the water, and fell a further twenty-three feet, but at a slower speed with a shattered windscreen. Glass filled the car, glittering as the surface of the bay would under the sun. Son, thought Seymour. When the front tyres then the rear settled into the silt, Seymour flapped out of the broken windscreen, searched for and found some seaweed, returned to the car, strapped himself awkwardly into the back seat and, crying salty tears that changed his environment not at all, fell asleep, cuddling the seaweed as if it were a doll, holding it to the part of his chest that was a cavity, empty but for the bile of what he had done burning at him. He didn't bother to massage the inside of his thumb, he didn't stroke the outside of his upper arms, he didn't offer himself any other comforts. The doll came apart in his arms, seaweed unravelling like tentacles and, when he slept, he hoped he would dream of his mother's embrace. Instead, he dreamt of an arm.

Here is the second most famous letter that Abraham Lincoln ever wrote. (His most famous one was written to Mrs. Bixby, expressing his sorrow for the death of the five sons she had lost in battle.) Lincoln probably dashed this letter off in five minutes; yet it sold at public auction in 1926 for twelve thousand dollars, and that, by the way, was more money than Lincoln was able to save during half a century of hard work. The letter was written to General Joseph Hooker on April 26, 1863, during the darkest period of the Civil War. For eighteen months, Lincoln's generals had been leading the Union Army from one tragic defeat to another. Nothing but futile, stupid human butchery. The nation was appalled. Thousands of soldiers had deserted from the army, and even the Republican members of the Senate had revolted and wanted to force Lincoln out of the White House. \"We are now on the brink of destruction,\" Lincoln said. It appears to me that even the Almighty is against us. I can hardly see a ray of hope.\" Such was the black sorrow and chaos out of which this letter came. I am printing the letter here because it shows how Lincoln", "label": 1}

This is perhaps the sharpest letter Abe Lincoln wrote after he became President; yet you will note that he praised General Hooker before he spoke of his grave faults. Yes, they were grave faults, but Lincoln didn't call them that. Lincoln was more conservative, more diplomatic. Lincoln wrote: \"There are some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you.\" Talk about tact! And diplomacy! Here is the letter addressed to General Hooker: I have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac. Of course, I have done this upon what appears to me to be sufficient reasons, and yet I think it best for you to know that there are some things in regard to which I am not quite satisfied with you. I believe you to be a brave and skillful soldier, which, of course, I like. I also believe you do not mix politics with your profession, in which you are right. You have confidence in yourself, which is a valuable if not an indispensable quality. You are ambitious, which, within reasonable bounds, does good rather than harm, But I think that during General Burnside's command of the army you have taken counsel of your ambition and thwarted him as much as you could, in which you did a great wrong to the country and to a most meritorious and honorable brother officer. I have heard, in such a way as to believe it, of your recently saying that both the army and the Government needed a dictator. Of course, it was not for this, but in spite of it, that I have given you command. Only those generals who gain successes can set up as dictators. What I now ask of you is military success and I will risk the dictatorship. The Government will support you to the utmost of its ability, which is neither more nor less than it has done and will do for all commanders. I much fear that the spirit which you have aided to infuse into the army, of criticizing their commander and withholding confidence from him, will now turn upon you. I shall assist you, as far as I can, to put it down. Neither you nor Napoleon, if he were alive again, could get any good out of an army while such spirit prevails in it, and now beware of rashness. Beware of rashness, but with energy and sleepless vigilance go forward and give us victories. He woke happy. It was a moment but like any moments it became a memory, then not even this as he remembered what had happened yesterday. His heart squeezed blood out from his chest as though a small, pale hand had gripped it, as a hand would hold fruit. He unbelted himself, clambered up through the Packard and swam to the surface. With several heaves, he hauled his heft up onto the rocks beside where the boulevard ended and the Pacific began. He lay there panting, but not with the need to breathe, no; neither for water nor oxygen. A fisherman nearby stared at him belligerently, holding his rod fast, before shaking his head and muttering, but audibly, 'I'd throw it back; throw it right back in'. Seymour panted with grief. Others would call it sobbing but, despite the liquid his mouth normally produced, the sound was dry and rasping. The fisherman nearby glanced at the patch of Pacific Seymour had crawled out of, then withdrew his hook, shouldered his rod, picked up his box of tackle and feed, and walked down the coast road. Seymour lay curled as the sun shook off its sunrise clouds and stretched into the sky. He rose as did the volume of the traffic on the road off which he had veered, the day before. He walked, his Florsheims squeaking as they sloshed - leaving shoe-prints on the pavement in pretty much a straight line to the offices of the Post Record. There, and dribbling only a little now, he approached the desk of the receptionist. She glanced up from below her partition and across Seymour's frame as though he were an empty picture. Momentarily, Seymour stood before her, dripping. He felt the need to pee, and did so, thinking its noise would be hidden with the rest of the liquid. It wasn't. Still, she didn't move, bar the striking through of names on a list before her. 'Um,' he said. The sound of it bubbled, muted, as though he were underwater. He squeezed his left gill, and then his right, spitting water across the polished tiles of the floor. 'Excuse me,' he added, reaching forward to ring the bell on the desk. Bing! it went. She pulled back the list toward her cream, elaborately brooched blouse, ignoring him while avoiding him as a pedestrian does a vagrant. Seymour reached for the bell again and a small sardine flopped on the reception bar. It glittered under the crystal-housed bulbs above along with the bell's Bing! as though it were the thing that had been rung. Seymour gasped. He knew the sensation of being landlocked, of suffocating when everybody else seemed at their ease, of being unable to breathe. 'God, I'm so sorry!' he said to the fish, realising he would not be able to save it. The receptionist looked up, thinking he spoke to her perhaps, and saw the fish. She gaped as it did, then looked directly at Seymour. Her glare went sharply to wide-eyed shock, as if he had slapped her, or, maybe, thrown a fish on her desk. 'You're... you're...' she said, then, 'you come in with Mr Cross!' Seymour nodded, delicately spraying her immaculately made-up face. Seymour lent forward. The receptionist lent back, but tried not to show it. The sardine flapped, then flopped. Its mouth opened and closed. Seymour saw froth. Seymour saw a tapered, fitting", "label": 1}

'Please do,' she said, by which she meant, please leave. Seymour grasped at the fish as he did so. His hands palsying, it took him three attempts (which took the fish down onto the desk behind the reception's bar) to pinch below its fin softly as an injured bird might be held. He walked behind the desk and to the amenities, walked inside, past a human washing his hands at the sink, and then into a stall. He closed this, deposited the fish in the water and said- loud enough for it to hear him beneath the surface, 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry.' Seymour began to cry and then to sob. 'Go on, go. Be free.' The fish considered him then began to swim into the u-bend, and Seymour helped it by flushing the toilet. He then left the stall and walked past the man who had stopped washing his hands, but had not turned off the tap nor moved either his hands or the rest of his body, bar his eyes, which followed Seymour closely. 'Paper,' said Seymour on his return to the reception desk. 'Please.' he added. She slid a sheaf across the desk. Noah Cross had tentacles in many pies, and not all of them fish, and the Post Record would allow Seymour to place an insert into the late edition of that day's paper, as he had done with several Crosswords. To this end, he wrote, Dear Los Angeles Great Public, I wish you the season's greetings. Boxing Day is a day of presents, and what greater gift have the City of Los Angeles had than that bestowed by one man. One Noah Cross. You may not have heard of him but you will by the end of this letter this letter 'like a Christmas song- of praise. His gift to us all in this holy period, is progress. Like the progress of water over the desert, Noah Cross is the man responsible for bringing the water wars to an end, for feeding this thirsty city, for stopping the desert from driving us into the sea. Yes, you haven't heard of him. Like the best of great men, he is humble, he wants no sort of public recognition, But, believe me good humans of LA, he deserves it - he deserves everybody to know exactly what he's been doing, so that we may show him the appropriate thanks. The Mulwrays - chief amongst Mr Hollis Mulwray - stood in the way of the life-saving Alto Vallejo Dam, now thankfully speeding toward completion. Mr Cross used his well-earned and well-paid-for influence with the LAPD to end the threat the Mulwrays posed this city.

Charles Schwab was passing through one of his steel mills one day at noon when he came across some of his employees smoking. Immediately above their heads was a sign that said \"No Smoking.\" Did Schwab point to the sign and say, \"Can't you read.? Oh, no not Schwab. He walked over to the men, handed each one a cigar, and said, \"I'll appreciate it, boys, if you will smoke these on the outside.\" They knew that he knew that they had broken a rule - and they admired him because he said nothing about it and gave them a little present and made them feel important. Couldn't keep from loving a man like that, could you? After this, he said to the receptionist, 'And please add this to the Crosswords section...' He pushed a final sheaf of paper across the bar and lent in and whispered, 'It's so indirect I'm not sure they'll get it.' The receptionist looked confused but nodded and said, 'I'll hurry off and put it in the editor's office, then.' The 'then' was shouted back over her shoulder.

My niece, Josephine Carnegie, had come to New York to be my secretary. She was nineteen, had graduated from high school three years previously, and her business experience was a trifle more than zero. She became one of the most proficient secretaries west of Suez, but in the beginning, she was - well, susceptible to improvement. One day when I started to criticize her, I said to myself: \"Just a minute, Dale Carnegie; just a minute. You are twice as old as Josephine. You have had ten thousand times as much business experience. How can you possibly expect her to have your viewpoint, your judgment, your initiative - mediocre though they may be? And just a minute, Dale, what were you doing at nineteen? Remember the asinine mistakes and blunders you made? Remember the time you did this ... and that ... ?\" After thinking the matter over, honestly and impartially, I concluded that Josephine's batting average at nineteen was better than mine had been - and that, I'm sorry to confess, isn't paying Josephine much of a compliment. So after that, when I wanted to call Josephine's attention to a mistake, I used to begin by saying, \"You have made a mistake, Josephine, but the Lord knows, it's no worse than many I have made.

He wasn't crippled by shyness but by obesity. He was wedged into the seat. The women moved on. Seymour dared a glance as they passed. Three of them, all draped in lace, each as the help would drape a doily over the finest glassware. The only structure to their forms came from their slender, tapered legs, and the pretty little high heels at their ends. They all wore sun hats that drooped like the petals of great, lackadaisical flower heads, shielding both their faces (unless they were head on) and most of their willowy, white necks. Their clothes were baggy; fashionably so. The woman who spoke most, who led them chattering to their new seats, had black-cat-faces stitched onto any plane of white spacious enough to support them. Her own face, seen in a glimpse of gossip, was tilted downward and laughing as she went, lips strikingly maroon. A brunette, she had a dark expression, thought Seymour, like that of a black cat disembowelling a shrew in the middle of the night. While she spoke, her face may have been head on, but her waistline was not and ' from the side - became more of a line than a waist. The women sat and quietened along with the audience as a human walked toward the lectern. The book in the human's hands was embossed with initials (DC) in a diamond, separated and enclosed in gold lines. 'Hello,' the human said, a thin, jagged, black-suited man who had the look of a jigged line of charcoal that refused to be rubbed out, a line through the talent you thought you had, a redaction. 'I'm George Shimkin, an editor of Simon and Shuster'' There was a gritty, bitty quality to his short frame, his abbreviated gait, and his pebble-dash of speech. Shimkin was, in short, a simile of himself and, like any great literary agent, there was nothing he liked more than rejection. ''I'm pleased - very pleased - to present the author of our best-selling publication.' George Shimkin's tone sounded the most very pleased over the words best and selling, 'How to Win Friends and Influence people. Please welcome, the great orator, the life changing, the man who has made me a ridiculous amount of money; Dale Carnegie.' The audience applauded, sweaty hand to sweaty hand. Seymour thought of fish and felt at home, and all the more at the sight of the books front cover, sealed as it was in the kind of green that had framed FDR that morning, that swirled in the sea of home, which rotted through his mother's skin, even when she had lived. The hue of home. A glance across the theatre and Seymour saw that the man he'd followed was still there, flanked by his friends, close by the steps that led to the stage. Seymour clapped flap-ily as Dale Carnegie stood behind the lectern. Carnegie wore a tie the colours and geometry of shattered rubies on a cream cloth. This brought to life an abdomen otherwise covered in a black jacket. His legs were obscured by the lectern. The jacket colour is a wise choice, Seymour thought; he'll be sweating under there. Carnegie reached for a pitcher of iced water which had been left on the lectern, poured into a glass, and drank. As he did so, Carnegie gave a half wave of his left hand; a wave less like a welcome than an apology for interrupting whatever it was these fine people were doing. Seymour instantly liked him. Carnegie stood behind the lectern, straight and central and unmoving as though a continuation of its wood. The hall expanded with silence, until it could be felt on the skin, as the temperature could. 'I want you to say one thing for me, ' said Dale Carnegie. He had a pleasant-green Missouri accent, hard on the r's, high pitched and goosed by any long' 'oo's. 'Say to yourself over and over: \"My popularity, my happiness and sense of worth depend to no small extent upon my skill in dealing with people.\"' Seymour said this to himself. Despite the gap of seats on either side, his neighbours shifted a little further away. Seymour said it again, more firmly, touching, as he spoke the last three words, the hilt of the Smile in his pocket for confidence. He looked right and forward across to the other great red lung-shape of seats at the front of which sat Wandrei, Schoror, and Derleth. '' dealing with people...' Seymour intoned. August Derleth was eating another apple, in small, squirrelly, guilty actions, the actions of a man who has been brought up well but brought down by circumstance. Seymour ate the same way. 'I see many of you are carrying the book,' said Carnegie, and smiled. '.. I would say I wrote, but it was a book, as many of you probably know, that I spoke, and my publisher copied it from an event much like this one today, at this beautiful hall in this truly angelic city.' Applause. Carnegie had a familiar, welcoming face. His plain rimmed glasses seemed to hug his temples as a man would casually drape an arm around the shoulder of their oldest friend. 'Flattery?' asked Dale Carnegie. 'Well, as any of you who have read any of this book will know ' no it isn't flattery, but sincere compliment. Many people love this vibrant forward thinking city, and I can see why.' Applause. The sound of Seymour's palms struck an odd note, a toddler hitting a dud key on a cheap piano, and a man in the row in front half turned, disturbed by something he couldn't, Seymour supposed, quite put a finger on. Embarrassed, Seymour stopped clapping and pretended to continue to do so, palms rebounding off air. 'I'm sorry to relate, then, that those who", "label": 1}

I HATE YOU. I WILL KILL YOU. But it isn't all about you, no not this time, Daddy, because not everything in my life will be about you. There's one innocent child left in all this, and I love her. Now, it's about her. Because I can choose, can't I, the kind of person I want to be, I'm going to be? I can pick between the human in me and the Dagon. I choose her. [In white font on black, with the black clouded and smoky at the edges] Seymour dragged his Grandma along Bates Street, down Adams Street, past the ancient, shuttered station on Bank Street and into the railway cut beyond it. She was dead by Adams. Before she died, somewhere close to Rowley Road and discomfortingly proximate to the officials of the Federal Government, with their tight white lips on pallid faces (lips curled in satisfaction as they demolished his hometown, and looking, to Seymour, as when milk first curdles on a high heat)' before she died she had whispered through the blood and the shrapnel teeth displaced by explosives, 'Your fault'. She hadn't the breath to call him a failure, so Seymour had added that, internally. He'd discovered this route after H.P. Lovecraft had escaped and used it now, as his town burnt or, more accurately, exploded then burnt. He continued under a sentinel, arch, frowning bridge and, as he entered the tunnel beneath it, he turned and tried to see the black reef he used to swim across, the Bay, his mother maybe, but the vista was covered in a pall as grey as the uniforms of the Excise Men, so he turned away from Innsmouth. Still carrying her body he went from there to the marsh (wherein he was glad of its depths, and avoided the island in its centre). Somewhere near Arkham, he buried her. 4 - No One Likes To Take Orders ' Principle 4 - Ask questions instead of giving direct orders. Resentment caused by a brash order may last a long time -even if the order was given to correct an obviously bad situation. Dan Santarelli, a teacher at a vocational school in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, told one of our classes how one of his students had blocked the entrance way to one of the school's shops by illegally parking his car in it. One of the other instructors stormed into the classroom and asked in an arrogant tone, \"Whose car is blocking the driveway?\" When the student who owned the car responded, the instructor screamed: \"Move that car and move it right now, or I'll wrap a chain around it and drag it out of there.\" Now that student was wrong. The car should not have been parked there. But from that day on, not only did that student resent the instructor's action, but all the students in the class did everything they could to give the instructor a hard time and make his job unpleasant. How could he have handled it differently? If he had asked in a friendly way, \"Whose car is in the driveway?\" and then suggested that if it were moved, other cars could get in and out, the student would have gladly moved it and neither he nor his classmates would have been upset and resentful. Detective Loach walked low to the ground with his hands wide from his hips. He sweated. Not just here, in this infernal part of town, but everywhere. Mainly from his armpits. He had to wear two vests, which did nothing for the sweating, but stopped it reaching his jacket. Loach wore the fashion of the year. Grey suit, white shirt, red", "label": 1}
{"text": "tie. But his shirt was not white enough, his tie was not red enough, and he was not handsome nor tall enough. He had won and lost a woman or five in his time, yes, but they were all ugly and short and either as grey as his skin, or the kind of bilious sour you get with luminous sweets. They drank too much. He had never married nor had kids. Yet, he had the wrinkles and drained complexion of a man married for ten years too long with two boys, a girl, a fourth on the way, and money nearly run out. The dregs of a drained marsh had the same hue as Loach's skin; grey, sallow, and, now that he was sweating again, liquid. He walked to the end of the alley and past the guard there. 'Dick-tective,' said the guard, and let him in. Loach let him. Later, he told himself, he'd let him have it, and by 'it' he meant a bullet from his gun. Loach descended one flights of stairs more than Seymour had when he'd chased August this way. The air was loud and humid down her, beneath the bellowing gusts of the Chinese laundry, long whiffs of steam let of into the corridor along which he paced. Wet as all bloody hell, he thought. He entered. There wasn't much left in the room except for the smell. It was dark, as ever it had been, lit only by light from the studio apartment above. The shine came down a black hole, singed as it was by the small fire that had discovered the room better than any detective work. Well, than his detective work. Death. It was everywhere and, as it tended to do when Loach felt vaguely threatened, his hand fell on the hilt of his gun, his finger on the trigger. If there were details in the room they lay in the imagination, a portrait of what had been done to human beings over time by other human beings with hot wires and clippers and knives. Luckily Loach saw only blackness. He didn't have an imagination beyond what he would do to that fucking guard with his fucking gun. Dick-tective, my arse, he was thinking (along with BANG) when he heard, 'God. How do you look grey even in the dark?' 'I... Sir?' Escobar. The lieutenant stood in the shadows beside the wall, like a lizard in the shade of the day, and camouflaged, a gecko in a cream fedora and jacket. The fedora was pulled low, and the shadows close, and Loach could see little of his expression bar a curl of his lip, and Escobar's irritated fingers curling on the air as though searching for a cigarette that wasn't there. 'You know,' said Escobar. 'I did some detective work of my own, while I was waiting for you...' Loach was sure he said 'dick-tective'. 'Sir?' '' Just asking around, you know, the obvious. Seems an ugly man ran into the apartment above us just before the fire. Ugly, they all said, all the witnesses, and these were Chinamen, in Chinatown. They thought he was ugly.' Loach didn't know where this was going. His hand fell to the hilt of his gun, finger to trigger. He wouldn't have been able to say where his hand was going, either. 'Only one bloated, evil looking misbegotten sin I know that a Chinaman would call ugly, 'cept your mother, and that's the sack of rotten fish you called an L.A. Times reporter, yes?' 'Yes?' Loach didn't know what else to say. Escobar did. 'And that reporter guy- the one who looked like a fish had died and rotted and bloated up as it rotted, yes, Peemore, or Seeshit, or whatever. It turns out he's not a reporter for the Times but tried to slip them some copy fingering up Noah Cross as Mulwray's murderer, yes, that Noah-Who-Is-Now-Incredibly-Fucking-Cross, and that Pissmore is a dead man, a dead fish walking. He got some spiel or other into the Post, though. I'm saying you stupid flatfaced flatfoot, he pulled the wool over your eyes (which frankly would be an improvement if it also stopped us having to see the rest of your face) and don't talk to him again, you understand. If you see him, just arrest him. If you talky talky, I breaky your jawy. Si?' 'This is'' began Loach, finger raising. He hadn't noticed, but it was still attached to the trigger of his gun. 'Put your gun down!' shouted the lieutenant, loud and sudden enough to make Loach raise the whole weapon, as though to ward off the noise. 'Don't you dare raise your gun to me! You're a detective. I'm a lieutenant.' 'What?' 'Sorry,' sneered the lieutenant. 'What?' 'Sorry sir, or, pardon sir, not what. I'm not your hooker. Speak to me with respect. God knows I deserve more of it than you have to give. God knows the guard at the alley is right, you do put the 'dick' in detective.' Loach was unsure if he was being called homosexual. He blushed the ash of a fire nearly burnt out. 'Sorr'' 'You pulled your gun in public. In the street in Chinatown. I told you not to do that. Don't do that. Don't pull your gun. Not in Chinatown.' Loach attempted another question, but the words, again, were too quick, and his ' Loach's thoughts too slow to his lips. Escobar looked down his aquiline nose at Loach's stammering. Loach knew there was a word for his expression ' supercilious- but only knew its first two syllables, and that it didn't feel anything of the sort. Besides, he had only ever beaten Escobar in an argument once and that was much later than their actual conversation, and inside his own mind. 'Not in the heights, not at the docks, not in your mother's bed, not up her cooch. You don't pull your gun, got it?' The shouts had become concussive. Loach", "label": 1}
{"text": "felt punch drink. He thought he heard two of everything but- unlike punches- none of the words were going in. He blinked in confusion, or thought he did. In reality, it was one wink followed by another. He wanted to say, as he so often wanted to say- but I shot Mulwray. She was getting away, a fugitive. Escobar, as ever, beat him to it. 'You think shooting a woman from behind was a good thing? You think killing a woman by shooting her from behind was a good heroic idea? Give me your gun. I've had enough of you, Loach you're a loose cannon, and like a loose cannon; you're shit at shooting. Give me your gun!' 'STOP BOSSING ME AROUND,' screamed Loach. It was out of his mouth before it was a thought in his brain. He stared down his face as though at his lips. 'PUT THE GUN DOWN,' shouted Escobar. 'Put the gun down,' Loach felt himself whisper. He couldn't hear the words. Loach lowered the weapon, but while his arm was willing, his trigger finger was not. It tightened. The gun buckled as it discharged. Lowered as it was, the bullet went into Escobar's gut, the impact staggering him backward, until he had slid down a wall sooted by the fire from above. Escobar, even here, even below Loach, even bleeding from the stomach, looked down his nose at the detective. Loach leapt forward, bending before his superior, hands stammering as his words were, now. 'Sorry lieutenant, sor-sorry.' It was what he wanted him to say, wasn't it? He didn't know where the gun-wound was, but he was - despite the lack of light ' intently aware of where blood had seeped through the lieutenant's crisp shirt. Escobar's cream jacket had a new, richer, lining. Loach pushed his fingers - still palsying - against the wound, perhaps to dam the flow, perhaps to block it from sight, maybe both. 'GET AWAY FROM ME. GET AWAY. Ge...t...' The barked orders stretched out as they quietened, becoming inaudible below the clatter and hiss and bang of the laundry next door. The shock, thought Loach. God, yes. The shock. Loach jumped up and strode to the door and through it. He slowed his walk - though not his heart - as he walked down the corridor, its planks creaking somehow audibly beneath his feet, but they- his feet- grew distant from each other as he jolted into a run, past the guard at the alley, and joined the main street of Chinatown. His thoughts knew as little the destination it sought as his feet did, and they both ran wild. - 5 - Let The Other Person Save Face Years ago the General Electric Company was faced with the delicate task of removing Charles Steinmetz from the head of a department. Steinmetz, a genius of the first magnitude when it came to electricity, was a failure as the head of the calculating department. Yet the company didn't dare offend the man. He was indispensable - and highly sensitive. So they gave him a new title. They made him Consulting Engineer of the General Electric Company - a new title for work he was already doing -and let someone else head up the department. Steinmetz was happy. So were the officers of G.E. They had gently maneuvered their most temperamental star, and they had done it without a storm - by letting him save face. Letting one save face! How important, how vitally important that is! And how few of us ever stop to think of it! We ride roughshod over the feelings of others, getting our own way, finding fault, issuing threats, criticizing a child or an employee in front of others, without even considering the hurt to the other person's pride. Whereas a few minutes' thought, a considerate word or two, a genuine understanding of the other person's attitude, would go so far toward alleviating the sting! Seymour placed the valise on the floor in front of the bookstore's shelves. The boy and his Smile were forgotten and his smile was a warm flood across his face, both of slipped saliva and of muscles relaxing and lips spreading. The feel of it was warmed by a glow that came, to Seymour, off the books. There were many establishments in Chinatown that claimed to be Golden, but this was the only one that glowed. The books gave a soft low light. The steady, modern, electric hum of Steinbeck. The dull, waxy, bottomless candle of Hardy. The magnesium-in-water alchemical flare and pop and dancing light of Ben Jonson's mind. He reached out to the 'NEW' section and touched Steinbeck and opened his pages and the light went into him, or - more ' the words were a voice in his head that did not denigrate, did not speak Dagon. The shop's owner was watching him in that wincing, squinting expression of those that did not want to look, but felt they had to 'as at a large bodied spider they would have to move. 'You buying that?' he asked. Seymour did - along with all books Cross had burnt - then placed 'Of Mice and Men' on top of the other titles in the valise, left the shop, and turned next door. On one side was the bookstore, on the other 'Herbal Spice' and, in between but lower down, 'Le Grande Midgetian'. The flanking signage was first in Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese- it was all Chinese to Seymour) and then translated into English. The middle shop, indented from the street as though a tabbed, short paragraph, was signed first in European (a 'salaud'isation of English and French), then translated into graffiti, though Seymour was sure the interpretation was not accurate. Underneath the 'Le' was a drawing of an erect penis, while 'Grande' and 'Midgetian' were hung with over-large, hairy testes. Nothing was cool in Chinatown, even that late in the year, but the wall beside the door was close", "label": 1}
{"text": "enough as Seymour lent his head against it, close enough to chilled to remind him of child, and the wall itself close enough to the fevered pulse of the memory he could not shake- of a still arm and a stilled, small corpse. He drew in a ragged, pleuritic breath. It was no different - in raggedness or agony - from all the other ones. He shook his head and, leaving a daub of condensing sweat on the stone surface rose, went through the darkened door beneath the testes. Inside the store was as shadowed as its door. There was everything you would imagine in a wizard's apothecary of any age, swirling globes, crystal balls, wizened hands, cards, deeply burnished dark wood furniture of all shapes and intended usages, tomes, and minor books. There was also everything you would expect from a joke shop of this post Great-and-Final-War age, tat like that which Seymour now held up. His fake nose, non-prescription glasses, and horse-hair moustache. 'Excuse me, excuse me,' he said. His voice shook as though Seymour knew being excused was unlikely. 'Uh-huh,' replied a voice from behind the counter. Seymour was imposing and it didn't take much peering to see Le Grand Midgetian. He was not wearing his shiny black boots and red jacket, but a scruffy black suit and cheap shoes. His moustache and goatee were not waxed, now, but scruffs of hair, like the tufts ripped off a manged dog's skin by its excessive scratching. Out of his magician costume he looked incongruous. Then, again, thought Seymour, he was just as incongruous in it. He was small, so should have fitted neatly into his surrounding, but didn't, almost wilfully didn't. The Midgetian was eating an apple- not a Cox, but still Seymour's breath held, momentarily, and he sweated more than normal, which was, as far as his ribcage was concerned, a downpour. 'Uh-huh?' Seymour held up the fake face. The great Midgetian, however, spoke first, 'I don't give refunds,' he said. He looked Seymour up and as far down as the counter would allow, then looked at his apple, then put his apple on the counter, nose wrinkling as he looked at it, now, as though the sight of Seymour had suggested that everything else might be rotten. 'Caveat emptor.' He added, 'Sold as is.' Asses? Thought Seymour, before correcting himself and recalling he should have been thinking about the other end of the body. Let the Other Person save face. Seymour pointed at the features in his hand, and said, 'This worked very well. Nobody gave me a second glance. I was wondering if I could buy something else?' Le Grande Midgetian swept his empty hands out to indicate the vast range of goods. His span did not do the store justice. 'You'll have to be more specific.' he said. 'Well, I want a big ending for my final act. I want to go out with a bang,' Seymour leaned over the counter causing the Midgetian, in turn, to lean away. 'But I also have a certain affinity with water, and want to use the liquid in my finale. Do you have anything that can explode underwater? A firework without the fire?' 'I have even better,' said the Le Grande Midgetian. 'Thermite. Aluminium and a little something else I have sent especially. Just received a consignment from my comrades in the French army. They have plenty, ready for that short, ugly, moustached Bratwurst to hang his Kraut cock over the Maginot Line, so that they can blow it off the crotch that is Allemande. Follow me.' Seymour followed him across carpet that pulled at his Florsheim soles as did the image from the grocery store pulled at his soul, of a rolling apple from an empty hand. To fill the silence, Seymour said, 'I went to the premiere of Snow White. It was great, I saw seven of your kind there.' Le Midgetian did not break stride, asking, 'You mean French people?' 'No, dwarves.' Now, Le Midgetian stopped, and stared at Seymour as though he might break something other than the rhythm of his own gait. Perhaps, Seymour's legs, with much the same result. 'I mean... midgets...' said Seymour. The stare continued. 'I meant French people,' Seymour conceded. 'Mais oui,' whispered Le Midgetian, before turning and walking again. Yes, thought Seymour, when you look at me that way I feel like I might. They walked down an aisle of jewellery covered in non-specific but non-Egyptian hieroglyphs in glass, locked cabinets, and past the small cupboard he had seen on the SS Catalina. 'I recognise that,' he said, pointing. 'And...' His point drifted up the full sized wardrobe beside it. 'Yes, my petit pomme disappearer,' said the Midgetian. 'And his sister, his fat, over-eating sister, for the disappearing of the human.' 'How does it work, or is the magic a secret?' 'Not if you're thinking of buying,' said Le Midgetian. He opened the wardrobe, and tapped at the base. 'Of course,' he said. 'It is hollow as you'd expect, for there is a draw below.' He opened it. 'But the draw is a fake. What you see here,' he said, of the draw that he had pulled out. '' the draw is forming from a new floor dropping out as it comes out.' The Midgetian leant into the wardrobe, pointing. 'The original floor remains, with enough space for a man, not an obese man, perhaps...' here he raised an eyebrow at Seymour, '' to curl in, and hide. When you wish to retrieve your hidden magic you press this lever here'' Seymour had been listening but it was then that he saw Detective Loach, through the shadowed door, on the street, pacing backward and forward; grey in a street of colour, a fast moving rain cloud on an otherwise azure sky. Seymour held a finger up, as though he didn't know which way the wind was blowing from the look on Loach's face. 'Gotta go,' he said.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Le Grande Midgetian stared after him. 'Like I thought,' he said. 'Un mauvaise pomme.' 'Tell me what happened,' said Seymour. It was an order but, well, rules were written to be broken, and at no time more so than when talking to a broken man. Loach ran his hands across his face, as he had in the street, and their walk down it, down the stairwell, along the corridor, and back into this room. Seymour had been here before, of corpse but the body of Lieutenant Escobar hadn't been amongst the corpses last time. 'He... I... He...' said Loach, pointing at where Escobar was slumped. 'I,' interrupted Seymour. 'Read a lot these days, and one book I read was by this professor from Colombia called professor Antenednor Voc, it's on how to speak well and fluently. He's from Columbia University, Bogota Department, he said' ' 'Colombia the country you fucking idiot,' spat Escobar, with some blood, before his face lolled, and his eyes went away again. 'He's awake?' Detective Loach raised a horizontal, flat hand which shook in a sign of sort-of. 'Up and down...' Loach said. 'Anyway, the professor suggests trying this, to calm down a jittery tongue...' 'I... I...' Loach was making a trigger finger in the air, and a recoil of his hand. His gun lay on the floor, pointed away from Escobar as if to say, 'Wasn't me!' 'Yes, repeat after me,' said Seymour. 'After me,' flinched Loach. A little too good at following orders, apparently, thought Seymour. Seymour breathed, then said, 'Around the rocks the ragged rascal ran.' Loach swallowed, but it didn't stop him following. 'A-a-a-around the rocks the raging'' 'Ragged.' 'Rag-rag-rag-ed rascal'' tried Loach. 'Ran.' 'Ran.' 'You shot me. You fucktard.' Escobar was back and then, again, gone. 'Very good,' said Seymour, in response to Loach. 'Now, try; Sinful Caesar sipped his snifter, seized his knees and sneezed.' 'S-s-s-s'' 'Simpletons,' said Lieutenant Escobar. ''inful Caesar sipped his snifter, seized his knees and sneezed.' Detective Loach barked a laugh at the end, the cut off of a laugh, the stammer of a laugh. But he was breathing again, and his hands no longer bothered his cheeks, and his forefinger no longer curled around an imaginary trigger. 'Now,' said Seymour. 'Moses supposes his toeses are roses. . . . . .but Moses supposes erroneously. Moses, he knowses his toeses aren't roses. . . . . .as Moses supposes his toeses to be.' 'Why do you think you'll get away with this?' snarled Escobar. He tried to rise and lolled backward. He reached for his gun, pulled it out, and passed out. 'You didn't take his gun off him?' asked Seymour. Loach blew out his lips in a tight, almost airless whinny and shook his head. Seymour reached down and took the gun. Escobar woke and tried to grab his hand. 'They've put the word out you know,' he whispered between gritted, pinked teeth. His breath smelt of guts, but not ones that had been passed downward. 'I didn't know why, until now. Noah Cross wants to see you. Why ask for his own son? I thought. Why not just ask his own son? I thought. But you're on the run, aren't you? You've displeased Daddy. And I tell you, son, I know what a displeased Noah Cross does to people. He'll gut you and leave you to rot on the dirtiest street in this Chinatown, right? And the thing is, you won't look or smell any different, right?' 'Fuck you,' said Seymour. 'Oh yes. That's the real you isn't it,' said Escobar. He didn't seem to be for falling into unconsciousness again, despite his teeth now being more red than pink, and his shirt just the same. 'Beyond all that nicety nice, never disagree with anybody, always say the right thing, you're a monster, aren't you, as much on the inside as on the outside.' Seymour thought of the boy. 'Yes,' he said. He looked at Loach. 'You don't have to say anything,' he said to Loach. 'It's obvious what happened here. You snapped.' Delirious, Lieutenant Escobar began to laugh. Yes,' said Seymour again, to Escobar. Then, he bent and, using the lieutenant's gun, shot the lieutenant through the roof of his laughing mouth and into his brain, most of which appeared on the wall behind him. Seymour closed his eyes. Behind them, there was an image, there was so often an image, of a gun in Seymour's mouth, his finger on the trigger. Another image. His brains on the wall. It was so clear now, he thought he could almost reach out and touch that grey matter, until he realised he could, but it was Escobar's. He dropped the gun and it lay listless and unnoticed on a tile. Then, there was a dripping sound too quick and too thin to be blood. Seymour opened his eyes and turned around. Detective Loach had wet himself. 'Don't worry,' said Seymour, staring up at the burnt hole in the ceiling to the apartment above, '' I have a way out of all this.' Seymour retrieved his Smile from its side-pocket and, working into the fat of the subcutaneous layer, peeled off the skin of Lieutenant Escobar's face. It was messy work but the room was used to it. Loach was not, and made another wet splatting sound, but this time with his mouth. Seymour ignored him, humming 'hi, ho, hi, ho' as he worked' until he realised he wasn't. The room was silent Loach managed, 'You okay?' thickly, from the shadows in which he bent. Seymour was staring at the wall, at the brains he had blown there. Deja vu sprang to mind, he thought. He had seen that image many times, but always with his own mind in splayed up brickwork like a giant's thumb print, a giant who had been finger painting in red. 'No,' he whispered. 'I'm a fiend.' His consciousness smeared, also, bleary as the brains, and he added in a sudden", "label": 1}
{"text": "shout. 'No! I need a midget, a drink and a large box. Not in that order!' These were orders, of course, but Seymour was beyond caring. He felt drunk already, and needed, more than anything, for the alcohol level in his blood catch up. 'Stay!' he added in a shout - as he walked out - and Loach did. 6 - How To Spur People On To Success In the early nineteenth century, a young man in London aspired to be a writer. But everything seemed to be against him. He had never been able to attend school more than four years. His father had been flung in jail because he couldn't pay his debts, and this young man often knew the pangs of hunger. Finally, he got a job pasting labels on bottles of blacking in a rat-infested warehouse, and he slept at night in a dismal attic room with two other boys - guttersnipes from the slums of London. He had so little confidence in his ability to write that he sneaked out and mailed his first manuscript in the dead of night so nobody would laugh at him. Story after story was refused. Finally the great day came when one was accepted. True, he wasn't paid a shilling for it, but one editor had praised him. One editor had given him recognition. He was so thrilled that he wandered aimlessly around the streets with tears rolling down his cheeks. The praise, the recognition, that he received through getting one story in print, changed his whole life, for if it hadn't been for that encouragement, he might have spent his entire life working in rat- infested factories. You may have heard of that boy. His name was Charles Dickens. ' Principle 6 - Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be \"hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.\" Seymour stared at his reflection in the orange of the Angel Face. He had recently sipped and the ripples of what little cocktail was left settled around an image of his face. The face, like the cocktail, looked drunk. Nearly all gone. It was also slightly distorted, not that anybody bar Seymour would have been able to tell, and he was too inebriated to care. The sight of himself did not make Seymour think of the mirror mirror of the witch's wall. Nor did Seymour think of the riddle 'You see it in water but it never gets wet...'.For a start, it was ugly, for a second, it was weeping and, for a last Seymour was finding it hard to think of anything but the boy. Another visage joined him in the Angel Face. This one, though smeared and distorted up the taper of the conical glass, was hale, and when it spoke, its accent was the hard, cynical, clean sound of ice crystals carried on the breeze of an Wisconsin winter. 'You don't want to kill me, anymore?' Seymour shook his head, and would have watched his own reflection do the same, if shaking his head didn't make the rest of him palsy, which disturbed the Angel Face's surface. 'Still,' said Derleth. 'I thought I'd wait until you were so drunk you couldn't do it anyway'' He added, '' Because of the boy?' Seymour said, 'How do humans go on...' Seymour meant to continue the question with 'after the death of a child' but could not. Derleth didn't seem to need him to. 'It isn't human to kill a child.' The voice cracked as it came to the full stop. Momentarily, however, Derleth resumed. 'It was an accident though... You meant to kill me.' Seymour said, 'I've been reading, reading, reading until I can't sleep and every next word is the word that will bring me peace, and I tell you August Derleth, it is making me question... it is making me...' August cut in, 'Into J Alfred Prufrock.' '' into a pair of ragged claws scuttling cross the floors of silent seas. I heard the mermaids singing, each to each, and the song of those mermaids was the sound of the monster that was half of me and that was enough, but then, then I became obsessed... overwhelmed... with a question...' 'What question?' asked Derleth. 'Oh, do not ask,' said Seymour with a quick grin, and a glance no slower. They both laughed. Thankfully, Derleth louder than Seymour, so none of the bar's patron's looked over in horror at the sound. 'And then..?' asked Derleth. 'Walt Whitman. I am question after question. I cannot stop feeling.' 'Well,' said August Derleth. 'That's the influence of books. Stories ' narratives - make you human. Even you.' Seymour sighed. 'It feels bloody monstrous.' 'Yes,' agreed Derleth, with another laugh. 'And now?' Seymour stared out onto the straight where Evelyn Mulwray died, across to the laundry under which Lieutenant Escobar's corpse sat against a blood stained wall. 'I don't want to kill anymore. Or... I want to kill the monsters who kill. Murder the murderers. And then... stop. Just stop.' Seymour rubbed at his eyes with hands that felt heavy enough to sink to the floor of seas. The knuckles came away wet. 'We all tell ourselves a story about who we are. To some extent,' added August. 'We are stories. You have swapped the book of You for another. One with a better ending, I think, though maybe not for yourself.' Seymour looked at Derleth and this time for longer, lingering on him in a manner which somehow did not make the human flinch, or look away himself. It was one of those connections. They were a song of each other, momentarily. When Seymour spoke next, he did so deliberately, slowly. As a drunk tries to prove he is not by walking in a straight line. 'Howie was the one who got me into crosswords.' 'Howie?' '' Lovecraft.' 'You called H.P. Lovecraft Howie' You must have been close.' Seymour gulped then drank and went on, 'He used to", "label": 1}
{"text": "pick up used newspapers. No money by then. No money in writing, as you know. Wasn't interested in the world, or America. Only wanted them for the crosswords and the obituaries. While he was dying, we would sit and fill in the puzzles and laugh about the dead. Much as he could, anyway.' Seymour drank and nodded, the action long and straight up and down. The deliberation of a man trying to walk a line when drunk. He said, 'Lovecraft talked of you before he died, not long before he died, you were one of the last things he talked about when you could understand the words, before the screaming.' Derleth's flat, hard brow cracked and wrinkled. The gaze from his dun eyes eddied as though Seymour had stirred a gutter. Eventually, Derleth asked, 'You murdered him?' 'Poison,' said Seymour. 'I made it have the look of cancer. It was not a good way to go.' They stared at each other. 'I'm sorry.' 'What did he say?' 'He said you were good, talented, that you should carry on his work. I read the work you sent him; your writing. It was rich, deep, you know. Good. Really good.' It wasn't, but now wasn't the time to mention the lack of pace, the two-dimensional characters, or the plodding, derivative ideas, Seymour thought. 'He thought so too. Lovecraft did.' He hadn't. Derleth nodded, and looked away. Then the Friend of Lovecraft sighed. 'I'll need you to tell me everything you know about the god your people worship, about all the gods in their evil pantheon.' 'Well, it isn't really a panth...' Derleth wasn't listening. 'And then I'll need you to do one more thing.' Seymour was listening. 'For the good of humanity, I'll need you to sacrifice yourself.' Seymour stared at the Angel Face. He drank and nodded at the last of his reflection. This wasn't a hard decision to make. In the end, he had already made it. 'Okay,' Seymour said. 'But I need a favour from you, in return.' Derleth's tone became as hard and cold as the place his accent had come from. 'What?' he asked. Seymour said, 'I need help moving some furniture.' 7 - Give A Dog A Good Name ' Principle 7 - Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to. 'Heave,' said August Derleth. They -Seymour, August and Loach ' heaved at the rope, but Loach groaned 'no' rather than 'heave ho'd as Lieutenant Escobar moved little more than five inches from the floor. With a burp of bile and what might have been brains leaking from the hole excised in his subcutaneous palate by a bullet, Escobar voided red, adding depth to the stains on the floor of the apartment below Seymour, August and Loach. Hanging there, despite the lack of skin, his sharp nose and acutely angled features gave Escobar the look of a bird above its young, reconstituting the meal it had caught itself minutes before. 'No,' maintained Loach, even before August Derleth's repeated, 'Heave.' 'Heave,' said Seymour who then regretted it, wiped at his mouth and tried not to remember how drunk he was, or that his mouth was more likely to do so, than his arms. 'Heave,' said Derleth in his crisp accent. Escobar rose a further foot, his shoes dangling as obsidian-shined as ever. As he was hoisted, the rope worked against the fired floor - burnt through from August's old apartment - making a dry, ratcheting, sawing sound. Abruptly, Escobar's bottom did the same, but more liquid in timbre, his buttocks making a noise about as wet as the brains, blood and bile had, before. 'Jesus,' said Loach. 'Who?' slurred Seymour, who had been brought up in the Dagon tradition, and not the Christian. 'What?' said Loach. 'Heave,' said August Derleth. 'Christ,' said Loach. 'He smells like a dead bloody body.' He blushed ash-grey, realising the accuracy of his simile. 'Who?' asked Seymour. 'What? Who do you think?' hissed Loach jabbing a point at his lieutenant. 'Heave,' said August. Seymour did so, glad that the rope was keeping him in a straight line and upright. Lieutenant Escobar rose further, his fedora now visible (set no longer at 'Jaunty' but at an angle that could be more accurately labelled as 'Jeopardy') above the charred horizon of the studio flat's flooring. Seymour imagined the porcelain cat clock, below, waving him goodbye. He giggled. Loach ignored him, saying, 'I'll get him. He crabbed over to grasp the Lieutenant by the armpits. Seymour and August took his slack. The grasping Loach knocked off the lieutenant's fedora, which fell into the darkness. There was a flump as it hit the floor, below. 'Leave it,' Loach said, to himself. 'You can't,' said Seymour. 'Why...' Loach lifted. Escobar slid onto the floorboards, riding up a hem of carpet frayed by flames. '' not?' Seymour sat, simply breathing, then said, in rushes between the breaths. 'If you stage his suicide... in the gun range and... somebody finds his hat here... where he was last seen... at the least questions will be posed... and at the worst.... posers will be questioned.' 'What?' said Loach with a jolt. The sweat slicking his grey hair and grey forehead helped lubricate the angle. Nobody replied. Seymour sat breathing and trying to forget about both kinds of heaving, instead, staring at the hairy overhang of his belly, and at the scales of skin there, run through by hairs that, even so far up from his withered, bloodless penis, managed to be pubic. The flakes tore up, cradle-cap-esque and Seymour picked at one. 'You have to wear the hat'' he said now that speech came easier. '' When you pretend to be Escobar. You have to pretend to be Escobar and walk past the guard at the end of the corridor. Escobar went in, and he saw him go in, so Escobar has to come out.' Saying this, Seymour went back to breathing. 'What?' asked Loach. He pointed at", "label": 1}
{"text": "the corpse. 'Escobar's already out.' August sighed. 'Yes, but if you were one of the last people to enter the room below ' and the guard knows you were ' and Escobar just disappears' You become the prime suspect.' Loach didn't say 'Oh,' but made the letter with his mouth, and big enough to be its capital. 'That's why I carved off his face,' said Seymour. 'It wasn't just for fun.' Once, it might have been for fun. Loach wasn't make letters with his lips, and without letters there were no words, nor sentences. They, all three, sat, near the one person who was lying down, sat in silence, all staring down at their own bodies ' better that than the body between them. Then, 'Let's go,' said August, rising, staggering over to the body of Escobar. Standing over the lieutenant, Seymour realised he hadn't congratulated Loach on his upcoming promotion, and did so. 'Lieutenant Loach ' sounds good,' said the Detective. He added in a mutter; 'It's been a long time coming.' Seymour thought of saying, Sometimes it's just a case of when the face fits, but didn't. The face-fitting would be later. Instead, he said, 'You'll use the rope to climb back down and then you'll leave. Then you'll walk back round, and you'll climb again and - with the face and the fedora on - you'll leave again, walk past the guard at the end of the corridor.' Seymour noticed the detective's expression. 'Don't worry. It's dark down there, and steamy from the laundry. He'll not know the difference between you' and you'' Seymour frowned. The drink wasn't helping. '' he'll think you and you are different' is what I meant to say' I think'' Loach shrugged, bent and grunted as they lifted Escobar and dragged him to the wardrobe by the door. The wardrobe hadn't been there before, when Seymour had last visited and arsoned the room, or even the day before. They had brought it here, down the street from Le Grande Midgetian. Seymour opened its doors, then the trap door at the wardrobe's base, and they hefted then rolled the Lieutenant into the rectangular hole, before wedging him in, foetally curled. 'As he came into the world; so he leaves,' said August Derleth in the tone he would later use for his writing. Escobar farted. 'Oh. My eyes,' said Loach, holding these. 'Shut the bloody door, will you?' They did so, first the trap door, then the wardrobe doors. Still, the stink seeped through the gaps in the wood. Seymour thought he could hear it hissing. The trio sat some distance from both the wardrobe and the charred hole in the floor, their legs and arms burning with lactic acid, their eyes and noses burning with flatulence. August and Loach blinked moistly at each other, while Seymour stared moistly, which made no difference at all to his looks. 'You just want me to let you into the reservoir?' asked Loach finally. Seymour nodded. 'New Year's Eve?' Another nod. 'That's it?' Seymour's head did not reply, except in staring. Just as listless, colourless and emotionless, Loach's expression had little left to lose, or little left that he had not traded away for brown paper bags filled with green paper notes. Expressionless but for a dull, unremarkable anxiety, he nodded twice where Seymour hadn't at all, as if firstly at the inevitability of being blackmailed, and then acknowledging his inability to do anything about it. 'Let's move him,' said August. He was always the one for action, noticed Seymour, and his outsdoorman Wisconsin accent suited his words. They rose and lifted the wardrobe through the kitchenette door, into the alley, and along the alley to its end. There, the engine of a navy blue Chevy pickup rattled and clumped as it turned over as though bones spinning in a grave. A short, rotund, greasy human with short, curly, lank hair helped them load the furniture onto the bed of the truck. He was not only blue collar but blue shirted, blue-trousered, with blue dungarees over both. The exception to the hue was his shoes which were not blue suede, serving only to underline the ensemble's class. As Seymour pressed money into his hand, the human's dark, brown eyes had the expression of a waiter who had been knowingly under tipped. The man's name, like his hair, was Curly, and Seymour knew from experience that the expression of disappointment was permanent. Curly worked for the Albacore club. 'Why did I have to drop the wardrobe here, and then move it again?' he asked. 'I'm just asking,' he added. Seymour took out another webbed handful of dollars, and pressed them into Curly's palm. 'You don't want to know,' he said. Curly had a round face with the one concession to angularity being his nose, the full length of it now involved in sniffing. 'God,' he said, mistaking the flatulence bottled in the wardrobe for Seymour. 'You can rope that thing onto the bed and ride in the back with it.' Curly combined a tilted head nod toward the wardrobe, with the body-roll of climbing back up into his cab. Seymour shrugged and ' with August's help - fastened the wardrobe. August climbed into the cab on the other side and Seymour clambered onto the flat-bed, and sat down beside the furniture, holding it in place as the Chevy jolted into action with all the grace and haleness of necromancy. Curly drove out of the alley along to the supermarket and then onto the main street, around the corner of which they parked. Momentarily, Detective Loach walked past, the latter's face still red from carrying the wardrobe. Curly looked askance at Seymour through the Chevy's thin rear window. 'Bit longer,' shouted Seymour. Curly shook his head in a tired action that had almost run out of momentum. A few minutes later, Loach returned, his face red, still, but now from where Escobar's severed features had been pressed against it.", "label": 1}
{"text": "August shifted to the centre of the cab but before Loach jumped him he mechanically swapped the fedora on his head for his own. Curly drove out of Chinatown and by Echo Park, downtown, toward the city centre, the Town Hall, then the coroners and Escobar's attached precinct. They stopped outside the double doors and Seymour unhitched then untied the wardrobe, before sliding it from the Chevy's bed and into the waiting Curly, August and Detective Loach. They ' with Seymour ' struggled the wardrobe to and through the twin double doors of the building, along the corridor beyond and past the translucent, folded glass door that was stencilled 'Coroner'. The skirting board of the corridor was blood red, which as they groaned and the wardrobe creaked and they preceded along it, seemed strange to Seymour, like following a trail of blood when the body was already in their arms. Then, he spotted Claude. Seymour's heart would have missed a beat if his biceps didn't need all the oxygenated blood they could get. Mulverhille reached into his jacket as he saw Seymour, then withdrew his hand as his slow focus narrowed on the Detective, on Curly, on August. 'Give us a hand, Night Train,' gasped Seymour. The heavy reacted as all big men do when presented with an opportunity to lift; he bent as though devolving to an ape, feet close to the tiles, and took most of the load. Claude glared around the edge of the wardrobe with a dull, animal angst, as if ' while not quite knowing what Seymour had just done- he was aware that he had done it, and didn't like whatever it was one bit. When he spoke next, however, several steps toward the door stencilled 'Shooting Range', he addressed Loach. 'So, Detective, where's your Lieutenant? You're like mother and child, you two, always at each other's side, you hanging off his tit.' He smiled wide over the last word, his lips in the middle of the grin puckering with a 'pop, pop,' sucking sound. As if offended by this, Lieutenant Escobar's corpse farted long and hard and, Seymour was sure even before it reached him, smelly. 'Sorry,' said Seymour. 'Sweet Mary,' said Mulverhille. Seymour held his gaze. 'It's neither of those,' he replied. Then, the stench did permeate the wood and the four men remained quiet as they held their breath and lugged the wardrobe to the stairs descending into the shooting range. Seymour swung the furniture so that Mulverhille was a step below the others and bearing more of the load. His jacket began to moisten at its breast, where it touched a white shirt that had pinked from contact with his flooded skin. His wide, kipper tie looked as though it was in its element, happily bathing in between both breasts. Mulverhille's mouth hung open, his lips flattened to the shape of an anvil; breathing heavily. They reached, in shuddering steps, the bottom of the stairs and Seymour guided the wardrobe into a corner, pinning Claude there, then letting go, excusing himself, and hurrying up the stairs before he heard the meaty clump of the furniture settling partly on the floor and mostly on the fingers of Mulverhille's gun hand. August followed behind. The yell of pain from below was silenced by the stencilled door closing behind them, and then by the twin set of double doors, as they made the street, and their get-away. 8 - Make The Fault Seem Easy To Correct Tell your child, your spouse, or your employee that he or she is stupid or dumb at a certain thing, has no gift for it, and is doing it all wrong, and you have destroyed almost every incentive to try to improve. But use the opposite technique - be liberal with your encouragement, make the thing seem easy to do, let the other person know that you have faith in his ability to do it, that he has an undeveloped flair for it - and he will practice until the dawn comes in the window in order to excel. Seymour closed his eyes and his heart opened, sending out great gouts of water-balloon-blood about his chest. Despite this disgorgement, his heart filled, swelled, as if, like love; by giving he received. It was love. Beyond his closed eyelids, a stripper bent, right knee cocked, taloned left hand creating its own silver stretch marks tracks up from her curved hip to the puffy bulge of her ribcage, her collagen pocked upper right arm pressing her breasts in their own water-balloon moment. The woman behind Seymour's eyelids had no more curves than a ripple on a dam's reservoir, a gentle, imperceptible wave of body that nonetheless held his gaze even when she wasn't there. Katherine Cross. In Seymour's imagination she was clothed stylishly in shivering, lilac chiffon, blonde hair shining not so much with its own light, as her own, which lit Seymour up and left him with a thick-lipped grin plastered on his face, the work not of a plasterer but of an odd-jobber. That look, if the patrons of the strip bar were to look away from the breasts and bottom they came to see, would have made them say, 'Idiot,' or' Retarded,' or, 'teenager'. None of these were wide of the mark. I will save you, Seymour thought ' as he often did ' and opened his eyes and looked to the side, where Jack Gittes sat. Like an abandoned lot, the private investigator's face had gone to seed; short, thick, black hairs a little too over-grown to be rugged on his cheeks, a little too long to be in vogue on his Adam's apple. These, and his red, vacant eyes gave him a devil-may-care-but-I-don't-anymore expression, He drank Old Fashioned as if they were going out of style and stared at the stripper with round, glazed eyeballs as icy as in his drink. Noah Cross used to say, when he had drunk too much whiskey, 'I", "label": 1}
{"text": "put the sin in cynical, son.' Gittes looked like he'd contributed the whole word. Shaking off the after-image of Katherine Cross, Seymour watched him. Seymour raised his ow drink thinking, it tastes like piss, smells like piss, looks like piss, but it keeps me pissed. Drunk, this made him smile. August Derleth sat down beside him. 'You've paid them?' asked Seymour with a slight slur. 'A private room's been set aside.' The strip joint was called 'See Legs', its name bookended by two pink legs of this description, giving the neon letters of its title the look of hanging genitalia. Above ground, the strip club offered the slimmest view of the sea and so its name sat in the no-man's land between being a geographical pun or a typographical accident. Besides, thought Seymour of the stripper, it would have been better called Goggle Large Tits or Purview Ample Arse. Being below ground (accessed by narrow, steep steps that looked as much a well as a staircase) both the breasts and the bottom needed to be lit by the same mammary shaped lanterns as those that illuminated the town hall. These were well placed, and their light glittered of the d'cor (which was a deep sea scene of faux treasure chests sprouting fake coins, and large, splayed golden shells). The brightness of the central runway spangled off all this, giving it a three dimensional resonance, though it was cut from card. Around the runway and reaching back into the shadows, men watched, their wrinkled, leathery, shadowed faces all focused and unmoving and lizardine, the draconian impression given further texture by the treasure hoard d'cor, and by the majority smoking. Black and grey curls of smoke wisped about the stripper like the chat up lines that could not be spoken. This rule was written up top, by the front door, below and above 'No Touchy' and 'AND NO TOUCHY!!!' A waiter, walking straight as his black jacket, as his thin tie and as his greased back and sides approached Jack Gittes. He whispered in Gittes ear, then pointed at Seymour. This one is on that gentleman, sir. Gittes laughed, an action too long and harsh. It may have been his whiskey going down the wrong way. Then, with shrugging shoulders that could barely be bothered to rise, Gittes rose and, sipping at his glass, walked to the side room. 'Well,' said Seymour, gesturing down his own body. 'The strippers here might be curvy, but he won't be expecting this.' Seymour grasped his right moob and made a loud honking sound. 'He doesn't have the look of a man who expects anything much, anymore, I'd say,' said August softly. They rose and followed Gittes. The antechamber carried the theme of cheap riches, but without the spangle of overhead lights, leaving the scene less deep sea, Seymour thought to himself, than deeply seedy. He rather liked the sound of this, before again remembering he was reading too much. This room was lit by a desk lamp, and by a horizontal but narrow window that led to the unlit street, into which full-moonlight flooded, as it might down to a sub-marinal wreck. Talking of wrecks, thought Seymour. Gittes sat on a leather couch that was smudged around the seat of his pants with the stains of multiple wipings. In his hand, all the whiskey was gone, the tumbler transparent but for the sphere of ice that now sat disconsolately tilted in its own effuse, as though quietly weeping to itself. Still, Jack Gittes sipped, his lips turning up in a repeated, disgusted snarl. 'Well, you're prettier than some of them,' he said of August rather than Seymour. 'We're here to show you your faults can be corrected,' said August. 'You've been reading from my book,' said Seymour with a slight squeak. Gittes drank, snarled, repeated both these, then said; 'You know that waiter fella said there's a no touchy touchy rule, but I'm about to be royally screwed, aren't I pal?' Seymour smiled and some drool splatted to a carpet that sounded wet already. He wiped at his lips. His mouth always ran away with itself when he drank too much. 'Don't worry, Mr Gittes, you may have been duped by a second rate actress into following Mr Hollis Mulwray. This deception may have led to the first discovery of Katherine Cross, and then to Mr Mulwray's murder. You may have then been na've enough to think the police were not corrupt or in the pay of the powerful of LA, and led Noah Cross, again, to his daughter - or granddaughter - and your actions will next lead to the young Katherine being raped and eventually killed, but August Derleth is right,' Seymour's smile widened, showing not only his teeth, but the innards of his gills. Yep, can't stop talking, he thought. Pissed as a fish. He continued, 'All this is easy to correct. Yep; easy peasy.' Jack Gittes lips and eyes had narrowed, and his fingers had done the same about the tumbler in his hand so that the glass creaked, adding to the wreckage theme of the room. 'I don't have to listen to this. I don't have to anything for anybody, anymore, pal.' This pal had a different sound. The sound of 'I have a gun in my jacket pocket and I'm guessing you don't, pal'. Seymour looked at the jacket now, and the rest of Gittes's attire. His red neck-tie was sumped, like a wound-dressing that should have been changed several days ago, and was now congealed but loose. His cream suit was beige in splatters, and brown at the wrists and ankles and hems, as though the shading had sunk to the extremities, as blood does, in a corpse. 'We can give your failures meaning. We can turn your life around,' said Seymour, unable to stop himself. 'All you have to do is come with us tomorrow night to the dam Noah Cross built, where he intends to sacrifice", "label": 1}

For they are worth a second, a third, and an endless telling.' He drank. They clapped. Seymour glanced along the rows. There he was. August. Good. He couldn't fail again. 'One of those greats'' Back to Carnegie. '' was George Bernard Shaw. He said, 'If you teach a man anything, he will never learn.\" Shaw was right. Learning is an active process. We learn by doing. So,' ...drink.... 'here I will depart from the script, and, instead of reading aloud, I will ask you to do. Imagine, first you want to shake the hand of the gentleman or...' Cough. '...lady...' slight smile, fist to his mouth covering, an almost delicate, feminine action, '...closest to you.' Seymour looked left and right. It must be easy for them to imagine, thought Seymour, as both made a point of not needing to look at him. Easier on the eye, at least. My looks are striking, I give you that, Seymour thought, as is my breath, according to the human I gutted last month. He'd said, 'It smells of bait' while he still could. Carnegie continued. 'Go on, now, tell them. You must shake my hand sir, madam you have no choice, shake, shake it now or you'll regret it.' Seymour turned. The woman at the end of the aisle wore off white from her toes to her silk scarf, which was pinned with a thick red brooch (the dark, crimson shade giving the impression the pin went too far in). She herself turned as if she might ask the red paint on the wall to take her hand. 'Shake, shake,' Seymour said, edging toward her. He knew he had a lisp - it's that formation of the lips, like the end of a water-slide - so he forced the words and a little shot out in spittle. It landed on her scarf. Luckily, it blended in. She was shaking; her head, her body, everywhere but her hands. 'Well, of course,' said Carnegie, cutting through Seymour's attempts. 'Your target, the man or woman you want to impress, is forced away. You have been too forceful. Insulting, even.' The crowd murmured in agreement. Seymour nodded at this truth. Carnegie continued. 'If you want to gather honey, don't kick the beehive. Now, try using some honey of you own. Tell them how much you'd appreciate the sign of friendship, how you've admired them from afar and how even been seen shaking hands with you would be a boon.' The words were almost out of Seymour's lips already. 'I have been looking forward to holding your skin in my hand for some time,' he said. 'I notice you are sweating. My skein is slightly amphibian and would welcome the wetness of your skin'' Seymour reached and she shrank and Seymour reached and his fingers touched the backs of her bent over, foetal position hands, and Seymour reached. He patted her with his damp fingertips, aware that she would not appreciate the full shake. 'There, there...' he said. 'There,' he added, awkwardly. This tapping went on for a few seconds until Seymour stopped as he noticed the audience had quietened and turned to the lectern. Mr Carnegie was solemnly holding a five dollar bill. Taut between his fingers, Abraham Lincoln looked drawn, but not as worried as the lady to Seymour's left. 'What would Abraham Lincoln do?' Pause. The bill shakes delicately in his hand as if to the wind depicted in the frieze behind Carnegie. 'Theodore would stare at his painting in the oval office and ask himself precisely this, on the eve of momentous decision. What would Abraham Lincoln do? I'll tell you what he wouldn't, kick over the beehive. Talking of his bitter, indenturing foes in the South, President Lincoln said, 'Don't criticise them, they are just what we would be under similar circumstances.' Under the greatest duress, in the face of the worst sort of provocation, our greatest leader always took the road of honey.' Carnegie paused. The hall was silent enough for Seymour to hear the crunch of an apple. 'A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gal.' Carnegie said. He didn't attribute, didn't seem to need to do so. A man in a white suit three rows ahead gave a long, warm nod at this as though at an old, respected acquaintance in the street. 'Now,' and Carnegie smiled here, as wide as his glasses. 'My publishers would like me to take a break so all you discerning folks ca buy a book or two.' The smile was gone. Thin lips, frame straight. 'Take a moment also to say something good to your fellow man. Practise this. Take in their hair, or clothes, or their easy smile, or the way they put you at ease, and tell them this. Odds of one to a thousand they have never even heard it from a human mouth. They may have guessed it, suspected so by others reactions, but never actually heard it said out loud. You'll be the first one to tell them, and the joy, the joy of this, is you'll be the first one to tell them the truth about themselves. They'll never forget the moment they hear a joyous, happy truth about their existence, and they'll never forget you. Don't forget that.' With this, Carnegie turned woodenly from the lectern amid applause, a ship in that Westward wind, and left the stage on Seymour's left. The woman was", "label": 1}
{"text": "Katherine Cross to an alien deity and bring about an era of terror and war and meaningless bloodshed. We need you your gun. I can't keep one...' Jack Gittes was up. 'And you think I'll fall for this bunk? After that 'third rate ' actress. I told her; I said let sleeping dogs lie. And I tell you Noah Cross has attack dogs, dogs like you, yes I recognise you, dogs that will rip out your throat, yeah, but also rip out your eyes, and most of your brains, like they did with Evelyn.' Here, he dropped the tumbler, which slapped against the thin thread of the carpet. The icy ball rolled away under the chair. 'Look,' said Seymour. 'We've already started rectifying your mistakes. Yes, I killed Lieutenant Escobar,' 'Um?' tried August. 'Shhh,' whispered Seymour. 'I'm on a roll' Yes, I killed him and hid him in the police-station, in the shooting range, where it'll be set up to look like he committed suicide. Come with us. You may be responsible for Evelyn's death but...' 'I won't,' Gittes was past them now, and through the door, shouting, 'I won't be fucking screwed over again. Fuck you.' Seymour began to follow him into the reamed smoke, but in the stairwell he saw a press of new bodies, faces thrown evolutionarily further back than even the lizardine audience. They slouched in, a band of four, five. A putrefying stench of fish pervaded the room, tainting the tobacco that hung there, and men in the audience broke eye contact with nipples and from an arse crack to stare in disgust at their own cigarettes. 'Back back,' said Seymour to August, as Gittes pushed past these newcomers. 'Back into the room.' They did and shut the door. 'What?' said August. 'The window,' said Seymour. 'What?' 'The Dagon,' said Seymour. 'What?' 'My Folks!' 'Oh,' said, August. He walked to the window. 'I'll...' said Seymour, gesturing with a flat, webbed hand. August nodded, stepping on it. Seymour hoisted him to the window. Derleth unlatched this and it swung open and he crawled out, wriggling left and right like a worm through the loam to the light. Or, Seymour feared, like bait. He grasped Derleth's lowered hand, and pulled himself up and after him. He grunted as his belly wedged in the narrow gap. 'Heave,' he said to August and wished he hadn't. He didn't want to think of death. Nevertheless, as the door behind him opened (not with a sound, but with a smell) he repeated, 'heave' and August wrenched him through. There was a rip and a thick welt of blood onto his crotch, from above his penis. Seymour didn't look back, hurrying doubled in pain across the street with Derleth, but knew several scales of skin would be left there, on the window ledge. At least the pain had, like the night air, been sobering. Scurrying, Derleth dog-trotting and Seymour lamed, they crossed Washington to an alleyway opposite. There, in the cut's quiet mouth, they stood, and wheezing but still somehow breathless, watching as the crowd of doubtful shapes returned to the road. Horrible, low voices exchanged croakings that, if they were in English, would have been Anglo Saxon. If Seymour were closer, he would have understood, but, as they lit a lantern, and hitched and unhitched its aperture toward the slip of bay visible between the buildings and down the streets, he could read the language in the lights. 'They're coming inland,' he whispered to Derleth, when he could. 'We have to move.' There in the bay, lit by the blind, white and pocked crone's eye of the full moon, and in response to the lantern's shine, a teeming horde of shapes swam inland toward down-town. They brought with them a sulphurous-mustardy fog, roiling in off the Pacific. 'What are they?' whispered August. 'Idiots,' replied Seymour. '' from the Appalachian hills, escaped from internment camps, from the Louisianan swampland, from the Bayou, all here for the New Year's Eve party.' 'The one we're gate-crashing?' 'Yeah,' Seymour muttered. He stared at the fog and tried to see through it to the Bay, He couldn't. He wondered if his mother was out there or, if not, where she was. Then, he twisted about. There was another flutter of lantern light from the other end of the alley, in the parallel road. 'They're cutting us off,' he said. 'Come on.' The shabby, malformed band had moved on from the See Legs so Seymour led them back past this, up Washington. Abruptly, a shape ' bipedal in body but sicine in face- staggered past August and Seymour from a nearby vestibule, past them and across the street, then East along Washington, toward the sea. The creature smelt of salt and beer. It - Seymour was sure - had the features of a catfish, its gelatinous, thick whiskers moving of the own accord, and drunkenly. They were covered in what might have been the foam of the waves or more likely the head of an ale. 'That was close,' said August. His voice was dry as ever it was, as a well-tended woodpile, but there as a roughness to it, a branch's broken edge, not sawn but snapped; ragged at the tip with fear. 'You'll have to walk like me,' said Seymour. 'What do I..?' 'You'll have to pretend to be Dagon,' interrupted Seymour. 'The streets are filled with sea demons; you've got to fit in. Look, lean forward into you left elbow, and pull your right leg behind you, like you're yoked to a plough. Good,' Seymour said. 'The bells, the bells,' said August. Seymour knew why. He laughed. He enjoyed literary jokes, these days. They walked together, side by side up Washington. 'There,' said August, between a moan and an exhausted wheeze. Jack Gittes. They quietened and followed him, dragging their lamed legs ever quicker as Gittes walked at speed, his Florsheims snapping at the tarmac as a rabid dog might at the air. Nice", "label": 1}
{"text": "shoes, thought Seymour. The tattoo of them stuttered every fourth step and Seymour could see from Gittes's silhouette that he would flinch then rub the bottom of his right Florsheim against the top of his left and kick out, over and again, as though there was a stone in that shoe he could not dislodge. Seymour flinched as Gittes did. Then, there ' the light - again. It was the other lantern, flashing once more at the sea, but this time from up in the hills, where Seymour guessed the Alto Vallejo dam would be. He didn't look back to the Los Angeles bay. It would be out of sight, now; behind the curve of Washington, and under a rotten, yellowed, piss-smelling duvet of fog. They increased their speed to match Gittes, and to get away from its drift. Gittes led them to his office block as, above, the sky began to blue, not the blue of morning nor even pre-morning, but the last of night, the navy blue of Seymour's breeding grounds, out by and below the reef, or of Gittes' Ford V8. Jack Gittes passed his parked car, and entered the offices next to it. Inside, two storeys up, Seymour recalled, would be a sign for J.J. Gittes and Associates, and it was in those windows, though blinded, that Seymour and August saw the silhouette of a man's head- his body elided by the angle- already at work. 'Claude Mulverhille,' said Seymour. It was his first thought. His second was, 'Too thin,' his third, 'Mr Walsh.' August turned to him. There was a question in his silence. 'Walsh is one of Gittes Associates. He's also one of Cross's ears on the street. He told us everything.' August opened the door and Seymour followed through onto thin-pile susurrating carpet. 'You can stop that now,' whispered Seymour. 'It just feels like you're mocking me when nobody else can see us.' August smiled, warm and wide and corn-fed and they went up the stairwell, circling once, twice. On a short corridor of doors spliced by translucent corrugated glass, there was a sign that said, J.J. Gittes and Associates Discreet Investigations. The font was austere and so straight backed the 'J' had the look of a backward 'L'. Beyond: voices, one of which was muted by the door, the other raised so that no wood or glass could get in its way. Gittes. 'There's always been something off about you, Walsh. A feel, like an apple that's gone bad and you only get it, pal, don't you, when you bite in.' There was an edge to Gittes voice that had not been there, Seymour recalled, before Evelyn Mulwray had been shot through the brain and left eye, in that order. He hadn't been given to metaphor, either, but that was the effect of depression. There was a muted reply, a placation that didn't get through. 'What you doing there, Walsh what you burning? Is that you script, is it? Is that what you were told to tell me? It that what you told Noah Cross about me?' Seymour went in, August following, his hands flapping almost apologetically as if to say, well look, I wouldn't have but for him... Beside the door was a black filing cabinet and a low mahogany desk, on which was a sword-in-the-stone paper knife. On the cabinet a fan was on, turning black and spindly and austere. Mr Walsh was burning paperwork, the fan distributing the fumes toward an open window. 'Hey pal, it's the middle of the night,' snarled Jack so extravagantly he didn't need to turn for Seymour to spot the curl of his lip. 'I'd say we're shut but that'd be kind of obvious, right?' 'He's Noah Cross's man.' Mr Walsh's cheeks and forehead went the colour of the sheaf he was burning. He dropped it and it sailed like a fired ship going down past the bin at his feet, and landed near his shoes. They were of an indeterminate make. Walsh stamped at the flames and they became embers. 'Cross?' said Gittes. Congruently, the name seemed to enrage him. 'You?' the sight of Seymour did the same. Gittes was fully turned now. Staring from August to Seymour. 'You'd better explain this, I can tell you. You followed me here?' 'Walsh is in the pay of Noah Cross,' said Seymour. 'Everywhere you went, we knew because of Mr Walsh.' 'Listen.' Gittes reached into his pocket. There was the outline of a pistol below the dirtied, off cream jacket. The hem of the pocket was a line in the sand. 'You'd better...' 'Did you ever wonder why it's impossible to make an honest living? Why some people are impossible to get at? To get near? No matter how hard you try, how many books you read, how many rules they contain? It's because the powerful are held up by the Walsh's of the world, Mr Gittes. The big men by the little men. Like a pyramid. They're the nothings that money can buy, and there's so many of them, there's always somebody to do Noah Cross' dirty work.' 'You can talk,' said Mr Walsh. 'I've stopped,' said Seymour, simply. He lurched forward, slipping his Smile free, and stabbed ' backhanded- at Walsh's right eye. Walsh grasped his wrist and turned it back against Seymour. The Associate hadn't reckoned on Seymour's girth, however, and was borne backward against the low mahogany desk, and onto its, legs splayed, fan flailing as it was pitched to the floor, where it crawled in circles. Seymour lay on top of Walsh, pressing his Smile toward the human's neck. Walsh was bloodied, already, but uncut, and Seymour realised his own hand had been nicked in the fall, his palm bleeding as his Smile had slid downward, and along. But now, all it went was down, into Walsh's throat, piercing it, then - with serrations as Walsh jerked to and fro ' severing the windpipe, revealing the white cartilage like its", "label": 1}
{"text": "own tiny white smile. There was a hiss, a raucous drawing of air, then of blood, then hacking, then stillness. Seymour rose into the butt of Gittes's gun, a hard exclamation mark of barrel and sight on his nape. 'You won't shoot,' said Seymour. 'You would have before, if you were going to. He's dead now. What's the point?' Gittes seemed to concede this with a slight tilt of his head, like a tiny sideways nod, raised the gun and walked to his desk in an adjoining room. He sat with a squeak of soft leather in his chair, turned to a cabinet behind him, drew out a scotch bottle, took a tumbler, opened the bottle, and drank straight from the stem. Seymour walked into Gittes' office, holding a tissue to his palm. The cut wasn't deep or long. Gittes didn't look at him but stared at one of the many photographs on the wall and, when he spoke, he seemed to be addressing a garrulous white haired, black wrinkled gentleman who stared back belligerently at whoever had dared photograph him. 'Put Walsh's body in the Johns. My receptionist will be here in ten minutes.' As Seymour left to do this, he turned, but not fully to the Dagon, rather to the middle distance between them. 'Put it in the men's mind, not the ladies. She'll shit herself before she reaches the bowl if you put it in hers.' When Seymour returned, Gittes had returned his gaze to the gentleman on his desk. 'Who is it?' asked Seymour, after a moment. Gittes shrugged. 'No idea. Bought all the paintings and photographs and ornaments with the office. Think it was some kind of insurance company before. Best when you're a private dick; that nobody knows anything about you, or can guess it from the photos you keep. Little I knew anyway, eh?' A pause. More drinking. 'Can I have an apple from your bowl? I'm starving,' asked August from the reception. 'I wouldn't, they're all rotten,' muttered Gittes, to himself. 'Oh, God, oh yuck,' added August. There was a spitting sound and Seymour guessed the bin in the reception area was being used for something other than burning papers. 'What do you want from me?' asked Gittes, seemingly of the single malt. 'I told you,' said Seymour. 'You messed up, but you can make it up. You've lost Evelyn, but together we can save her...' Seymour stopped. 'I mean; we can save Katherine.' The door to the reception opened and almost directly after it a female mouth, or so Seymour guessed from the screaming. He rushed out of Gittes' office. A curly-black haired, pale, red lipped woman was stretching her lipstick as far as it would go, 'OhGodoh,' she said. She quietened and looked at the mahogany desk soaked red and her gaze followed the crimson down to the wide slug trail of blood and then to the nearest corridor. 'I cut my palm,' said Seymour, indicating the shining paper knife with his gashed hand. She had little black-cat heads stitched into her blouse. 'You... you were at the How to Win Friends and Influence People book reading,' he added. She leant against the filing cabinet. 'I'm sorry... I don't recognise... I'm sorry but this really weird fog, smog like thing, like the limeys have in London. All yellow and smelling of fish... well that came in and this... I'm normally really good with faces but that fog has made me feel...' She stared at the red potato print of a man's scalp and shoulders on her desk. To her, perhaps, the shapes were both meaningless and starting to coalesce. '' queasy, I suppose'. I'm sorry.' 'You laughed at me... you looked at me and laughed...' 'Sorry?' she said. It wasn't an apology. Seymour stopped. She didn't recognise him. He was used to this. Besides he had, almost literally, bigger fish to fry. 'Hey,' he said. 'Don't worry. Grab a seat... maybe not your seat... I'll make you a coffee. Hey, by the way; the janitor popped by, said there was something wrong with the ladies toilets, something to do with the fog. Didn't understand it myself. But I wouldn't go in there. Terrible fishy smell, apparently. The janitor said to use the Men's - just check none of us our in there, beforehand, yes?' She slumped into the chair Seymour offered her and nodded. Seymour left and mixed a coffee. As he did this, he emptied the sink and filled it with water. Returning to the room, he pressed the coffee into the receptionist's hand and returned to Jack Gittes office. Gittes was asleep. August had now sat in one of his leather chairs, peeking out from between the office-blinds then turning back to place a hand on his abdomen. The blinds seemed new. 'Stomach ache,' said August, after Seymour hadn't asked him. 'Bad apple.' 'Sure,' said Seymour. He looked at Gittes. 'Would you wake him and bring him to their kitchenette?' he asked. August winced as he rose. 'Should I tell him why?' 'Tell him he didn't believe me about the sea demons. Tell him he will now. Bring him through straight away.' Seymour returned to the kitchen. He waited until he heard Gittes arguing but following August down the short corridor to the kitchen. Before they arrived, Seymour plunged his head into the sink and held it there for several minutes. About a minute into this, he heard a brief scuffle as Gittes attempted to bring his head back up, and August held him back, Derleth's calming voice explaining, through the echoing water, that he- Seymour- was obviously still breathing. 'Look at his head. 'Feel his pulse. He's alive. Moe than that, he's breathing.' There was a pause in which Seymour breathed some more, and bubbles rose round his ears, sticking somewhat to his greasy hair, before bursting on the surface. 'He's got gills,' August added. Under the water it sounded like, 'Ee's but bills.' After a further", "label": 1}
{"text": "couple of minutes, long enough to be sure he should be dead, Seymour pulled his head up and back. The Dagon shook the water off it and from his bulging eyeballs, bulging not because of a lack of air, but because of his deformity. Once he had finished shaking his head, Gittes nodded once and left the room. 'I think that was a 'yes',' said August with a grin. ' Principle 8 - Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct. ' 1. Be sincere. Do not promise anything that you cannot deliver. Forget about the benefits to yourself and concentrate on the benefits to the other person. ' 2. Know exactly what it is you want the other person to do. ' 3. Be empathetic. Ask yourself what is it the other person really wants. ' 4. Consider the benefits that person will receive from doing what you suggest. ' 5. Match those benefits to the other person's wants. ' 6. When you make your request, put it in a form that will convey to the other person the idea that he personally will benefit. 9 - Making People Glad To Do What You Want 'That's the bomb?' asked August, of the valise. Seymour placed it on the carpet in the middle of Jack Gittes' office and they stared at it, as though at a small, brown dog about to do a trick. It didn't move. 'The bomb,' said the receptionist, and giggled. She had torn the scotch bottle from Gittes' hand and finished it. Not because of the fog outside, or the screams they heard both muted and echoed by it, but because of the screaming she had done when she'd visited the toilet. 'Looks like a little dog, don't you think?' Seymour unzipped the valise and roughly tugged it open at the top. The receptionist laughed, the sound of it brittle and jagged and tinkling, like broken glass rubbed in the ear. 'I guess not. You can't do that with a dog. Not without a lot of blood.' 'There will be blood,' said August, typically biblically, Seymour thought. 'Well,' said Seymour. 'These are the best.' At the top of the bag were Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein', Emily Bronte's 'Wuthering Heights', and Walt Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass'. He raised the middle of these into the air. Under it were slim, sausage skinned packages of a Loach-face grey and mottled white material. 'Under these covers is an incendiary device,' said Seymour. Gittes didn't look, but studied his tumbler. 'It's what make acts end in a bang, magicians go out in a cloud of smoke. But it's a lot of it, a lot of bang, a lot of smoke, a real show stopper, he said,' Seymour said these three words in a French accent. 'All you do is push one end of the grey sausage into the other and you and everyone near you goes out with a bang. As an ajout supplementaire, it is waterproof.' 'And that'll kill Noah Cross?' Gittes asked, again of his glass. 'Yes,' said Seymour. Him, and all the Dagon nearby, and send my God Cthulhu down into the depths of the earth, he added to himself. Seymour wasn't yet used to people paying attention for longer than one word. They sat and watched the valise as a bomb should be watched and drank and the day of New Year's Eve proceeded not with daylight, not with the track of the sun across the sky, but by the circling of the second, then minute, then hour hands on the clock. The fog outside made the world a thick, fatty girdle of varicose yellow, veined by darker shadows, the occasional shape half formed and the more regular screams. The walls seemed to lean in and on them the photographs of strangers, drunkenly as the room's occupants, leering. On each of the screams, as though the slaughter of L.A. were a drinking game, they drank. They drank. 'The clock says it's time,' said Gittes, after an interval. 'If you want to get to Alto Vallejo in time for midnight.' He shrugged and his Scotch rippled. The receptionist rose crookedly, onto her elbow, then the flat of her right palm, then her buttocks. 'Not you,' said Seymour. 'Fuck off ugly,' she replied. 'I was just going to get another bottle. If you think I'm going out in this shit you're uglier than you look... I mean...' she laughed, '...stupider.' Seymour stared after her as she tottered to the cabinet behind Gittes, then rose himself; they all did. They descended the tight stairwell. The steps felt submarine, both because of the sea-fog pressed like a stained, wet cloth to the windows, and because it felt like they were sinking, like the submarine of the stairs had been holed, had tilted vertical, was going down fast. They stopped at the door. The Dagon were experts in portals and the alien landscapes to which they led. This was one, as foreign as any even in the centre of L.A. but the welcome mat was no longer out for Seymour. He was a pariah amongst aliens. Bent over as though they wished to disappear, they left the office block and went out into the textured fog - a clinging, close and wet embrace - and Gittes stumbled directly and blindly into August, who stifled a scream. It came out as a kind of meow. They were all trying not to breathe, except Seymour, whose gills took in the miasma like water in a soupy yellow-green sea. It tasted of broccoli. The car, Seymour recalled was close by, and they found it with out-stretched hands which Seymour thought would be abruptly filled with a claw, or a wet paw. Instead, he ran his webbed fingers over the smooth canopy of the Ford, and down to a side door, sliding into the back. Gittes took the driver's seat, and Derleth the passenger's, as the private investigator gunned the motor and flicked on the lights.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Neither the sound nor the illumination reached far into the fog. Gittes inched forward, which was about as far as they could see, and they began their drive up and out of Los Angeles and toward Alto Vallejo and its dam. 'Look ugly,' said Seymour. 'Easy for you to say,' said Gittes. Seymour ignored him. 'Hunch your shoulders. Pull a face. If they spot us, they'll see me and maybe think you two are just a few more humans along in the bloodline.' This made Gittes grin for the first time that evening, though Seymour was unsure why. Seymour looked across to August, who had crossed his eyes, stuck his top teeth well over his bottom jawline, and puffed out his cheeks. Seymour shook his head and smiled, the latter of which worsened his looks. Gittes- after weeks of drinking and nights without sleep- looked terrible anyway. He spoke to himself as he drove in a low and minacious mutter which Seymour, sat in the back seat, could not hear, except that the terminal word was always, 'pal!' They travelled through and up and out of the city. Seymour was unsure of the roads, but Gittes, despite the fog, seemed to know his way. He's been thinking about this dam ever since Evelyn died, thought Seymour. That dam's a con job. New Year's Eve ' the night of it - closed in, yellow and thick. The fog roiled and brought in sounds on its wyrm-like coils that might have been echoes, or may be faces pressed close by, salivating at the thought of the flesh of the car's occupants. Hands close enough to reach out and scratch the bodywork. Seymour's own fingers burrowed into the cab's upholstery. By the time they reached the dam, he was wearing gloves of foam. The gate, with its, 'Construction Pablo Alto Dam Trespassers Will Be,' sign, was open and though guarded by a short, human shape in a listless fedora. They were waved through. Loach, Seymour knew, though he couldn't quite see his face. Too grey. The air too yellow. Gittes parked, got out and stumbled across to detective Loach, embracing him, pinching his cheek. By the time Seymour joined them, carrying his valise gingerly, Gittes had moved on to Loach's arse. 'Maybe I can get some colour going here,' Gittes was saying. 'You old dish-rag.' Loach pulled his gun, finger jolting on the safety as his feet did on the tarmac. 'You...' he breathed. Gittes had pulled his pistol, also, and Seymour said. 'We need him. I killed Escobar for him.' 'What?' Like the rest of him, Loach's eyeballs jolted, but this time to the side. Seymour ignored the question. 'That's Cross's De Luxe.' He nodded at a wood-panelled Ford. 'Same as yours,' he added to Gittes. 'But newer and the next model up.' 'What?' asked Loach, catching up to the previous comment. 'The next model up,' snapped Gittes. 'Like I wanted to know.' 'It'll have all the stuff in the back,' explained Seymour. 'The masks, the robes, the tiara.' 'What?' Detective Loach's questions were fading in volume as they tried to spread themselves over a wider range of subjects. 'Escobar' robes' tiaras'' he mumbled. 'I'm not wearing a tiara,' said Gittes, holstering his gun. He staggered slightly. 'God I hate you,' he said, perhaps at Loach, perhaps at Seymour, perhaps at himself. 'What did you mean you killed..?' 'You make lieutenant!' said Seymour. Loach shut up. A firework burst overhead, green and gold at the edges and embered red as it died out on its way down. It was nearly New Year's. 'Fine,' said Gittes, who walked to the boot of Cross' sedan, kicked the boot several times, popped it reached in, and returned with three squid masks, the same number of old-blood-maroon robes, and a tall tiara fashioned out of jewels which seemed a slightly different colour from any of the normal range. They slipped on the disguises and Seymour mounted the tiara on his own head. 'Fetching,' said August. 'Retching.' Gittes made the noise more than the word. 'This smells like a fish ate shit and died.' 'Look,' said Loach. 'This is it. No more favours. We're quit, yeah? The girl's in the centre tent. No idea how to get there, though, this place makes no sense to me at all, especially in this fucking mist.' 'It's fucking fog. Can't you see?' asked Gittes. 'No!' hissed Loach. 'Ex-fucking-xactly,' said Gittes. 'OK. Time to go,' August said. Seymour nodded, his new mandibles nodding with him. Wordlessly, he set off for the tents on the car park's side of the dam, Seymour carrying his valise. Gittes didn't. 'Hey Loach,' he called. Loach turned. 'What?' 'At least you don't get shot in the face.' 'What?' asked Loach, using his favourite word for the last time. Another firework burst above the tents. Seymour didn't see its colour. He was looking at Gittes's raised gun. Gittes repeated himself by shouting, 'FACE!' and shot Loach twice in the chest. Detective Loach mouthed 'face?' almost whimsically, touched his chest, then fell on his back and died as invertebrates do, arms palsying for some time after his consciousness was gone. ' Principle 9 - Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest. They walked toward the centre. Seymour didn't find the way through confusing- this was his kind of plan, seemingly random, definitely chaotic, but with a pattern like that of coral, each branch leading back to its seed, like his family tree. The miasma was thick here, thickest by the dam, but still almost braided yellow and slipping between tent lines and over canvas, the hue of which was clearly, luminescently, white, the way bones are white, even under the puss. They walked toward what could be now seen as a central, small tent. Of course, thought Seymour, the seed of a reef is always one life, and it's the same for my people. Humans would have had the colour of the encampment as", "label": 1}
{"text": "virginal white. In some ways the colour scheme of the Dagon agreed, but this was seminal white, the hue standing for the semen that would impregnate the virgin, who was now at its centre, in the central tent, being attired, as Seymour well knew, in white, with white jewels clearer than diamonds, on a tall tiara, with a throng of jewellery weighing her down as much as, or more than, any princess of the human realms. They walked and Seymour limped, but the others felt no need to ape his lamed gait. The tents around them were empty but noisy, the chanting from the dam reverberating amongst the canvas, almost twanging the tent ropes. Fireworks sawed through the air, their detonations a hammer against the mountains that abutted them. They were there - the BANGS- to disguise the bellows of Cthulhu, as the creature lunged up the aqueducts toward the waters of the dam's reservoir, seeking the meat being prepared, now, in the small tent before them. Seymour knew the itinerary of the evening like the back of his hand. It was just as inhuman. 'I'll go round the back.' The gun was in Gittes's hand and the dead, disgruntled smear of alcohol had gone from his eyes, replaced by a glint that was carried by the barrel of his weapon. He was gone, then, into the fog, and around behind the white canvas. Seymour nodded, put down his valise politely at the tent's entrance as a guest waits for the valet at the entrance to a grand hotel but then (as a guest would not outside the entrance to a grand hotel) he smiled and drew out his Smile. It felt good, this incipient violence, it felt like the end of his previous life as much as the lives of those before him. He entered. Gaze fixed ahead, he bobbed downward, allowing his weight onto his lame leg, then twisted, and using the one good leg he possessed, drove the blade upwards under the arm of the Dagon that stood there, into and through his rib cage and into its heart. It died instantly, apart from an odd, short gurgle. Seymour was sure to withdraw the blade before the body dropped and spun, using the flat, dead weight of his following (always following) leg to spin his bulk about. The Dagon guarding the other side of the entrance flap was at its jacket, hand on the grip of a pistol. Allowing his Smile to spin with him, Seymour slapped the hilt of his weapon into the same of the other's, loosening it as he had his own lips, which now flapped and drooled, and knocking the gun out and across a lushly carpeted floor. The Dagon gaped - his face retaining its normal look - and Seymour threw his knife upward. The Dagon watched it. It glinted, which didn't harm the mesmerism of the moment. Seymour caught it high but on the downward curve of its parabola and - using its natural flight - drove it into the Dagon's watching gaze, and, by way of its right eye, into its brain. He let it take the knife as the body descended, wedged in its socket. At least, he thought, it died with a Smile on its face. August walked in. 'Blimey,' he said. In the centre of the central tent stood Katherine Cross, dressed in white with white robes over a white dress, with white slippers and pale ankles, and jewels brighter than diamonds in a tiara which may have been mistaken for white gold, but was forged of a metal alien to Earth. On her face was an elaborate, yellow mask of a human female screaming and weeping. It probably didn't mask her emotions, thought Seymour. In the eye slits, her own eyes shied and winced and rolled. If the eyes were the windows to the soul, these were as near to opaque as could be. She was heavily drugged and only shadows of fear could be seen- tentacled - moving beyond their sheen, and she winced at them and possibly, though the mask made it hard to tell, she wept. The design of the carpet below her had a Persian symmetry but an iconography of fish that were a world away from any desert, and icons of fish that were of a world away from Earth. 'You really do love her, don't you?' said a voice Seymour hadn't heard before. Next to Katherine, with a gun held to her head, was Noah Cross's butler. His long, white jacket gave their clothes ' Katherine's and the butler's- the look of His and Hers, a Bride and Groom in an arranged marriage, where the sacrifice of the woman was the arrangement. There was one line of smeared blood, light and recent, across the midriff of his white-coat, but no sign of bleeding anywhere on Katherine. 'Of course,' said Seymour of his next comment rather than the butler's question. 'You bring all of Noah's meat. You would be the one to prepare her.' The butler nodded, a stiff, quick action like all his actions, and like his moustache; almost non- existent. 'But you're human,' added Seymour. 'There must come a point when you think, this is too far, I've crossed a line I cannot cross?' Seymour gulped. The question had been discomfortingly human for him, and saying 'cross' so often unnerved him. 'You know,' said the butler. He had a Midwestern accent which could have come from Ohio, or Indiana, or Illinois, or parts of Iowa, Kansas, or even Nebraska. As with his silence for all those years, it gave away nothing about his past. 'I have a four year old boy. I don't know what he will do, except be a butler to the Cross family. You know, you rich kids, there's been a depression out there. Looking like they'll be another. If I have to work for a monster, I'll do it. I'll serve human-meat to fiends that", "label": 1}
{"text": "look like fish so my little boy don't starve. What do kids from families like yours know about doing what it takes to survive? About work. Just being born made you a success. And I tell you what I couldn't believe, the lengths that old fiend went to making a success out of you. All the way to sending you to that book reading, for that stupid book. I mean, if you have to buy it you'll always be a loser. Especially two copies'' 'Sorry to interrupt,' said Seymour. He was. It went against everything he'd been taught. '' You really heard everything, didn't you? Look; you are completely right, it didn't help me at all. And telling you you're right should make you like me, according to the fucking thing, but it hasn't has it?' The dislike may not have been evident in the Butler's impassive face, but it was certainly there in his gun-hand. 'Can I get that book? Just stay here. I mean where else are you going to go?' The Butler shifted uneasily with his feet, the end of his gun making the same squirm on Katherine's cranium. Seymour paced out of the tent, grabbed the valise, carried it back in, placed it on the tent's floor, unzipping the bag. 'Got to be careful... got it'' He eased out 'How to Win Friends and Influence People', the book sliding slowly between two sausages of explosives '' Here, this is what this stupid book was supposed to do for me:' He read, 'Eight Things This Book Will Help You Achieve ' 1. Get out of a mental rut, think new thoughts, acquire new visions, discover new ambitions... I'll come back to this.' The butler looked about. He seemed to wish Seymour wouldn't. '' 2. Make friends quickly and easily... All the friends I ever made I killed.' He indicated August. 'Or failed to kill. ' 3. Increase your popularity.... Do you like me?' The butler opened his mouth, perhaps not to answer, but definitely to interrupt. He got the chance to do neither. 'Nope; didn't think so. ' 4. Win people to your way of thinking... I never had a way of thinking, it was always somebody else's. First my father's. Then, this book's. ' 5. Increase your influence, your prestige, your ability to get things done. What do you reckon?.. Nope, again.' The butler hadn't bothered to open his mouth, this time. His eyelids had narrowed. '' 6. Handle complaints, avoid arguments, keep your human contacts smooth and pleasant... Laughable. ' 7. Become a better speaker, a more entertaining conversationalist... What do you think? How am I doing?' The butler stared at him impassively. '' 8. Arouse enthusiasm among your associates... Your face answers this one.' The butler nodded resignedly. Seymour breathed. 'So all I'm left with is new visions. Now those I have. Once my vision was my father's: bring Cthulhu in from the cold, and bring the cold, empty space between the stars with him, make meaningless chaos of this world, another Great War, pointless killing and madness. But now I dream of being grasped, of being harpooned by the barbed tentacles of a God, and by those barbs, impregnated with the seed of demons, all of which would writhe and die in my useless male flesh and then, just at the moment of Cthulhu's thwarted lust, I, Seymour, would thrust the cylinders of the explosive in this valise,' Seymour indicated the bag. '' into His blubbery skin, and blow Him back into the darkness between the stars. It and me. That is the vision, the ambition, this book has given me.' 'What blubbery crap,' said Jack Gittes. Jack was stood behind the butler, in the shadows, but the look of contempt on his face was clearly visible. 'God, you both do go on, don't you,' he said, then pulled the trigger on his gun. This BANG was in the tent and Seymour could not help but flinch. The butler had turned, perhaps to say, 'no, no actually, I never talk' and the bullet went through his head and directly out of his right eye. The cordite contact spun the butler further on his heels, before dumping him on the floor, dead. 'He has... had a son you know,' said August, aghast. 'I don't c...' began Gittes. He started. The butler's vacant eye stared. '...care,' said Jack Gittes, before continuing, '...care' care... care...' He backed further into the shadows and then just stopped, walking, moving, 'care'ing' stopped. There in the lack of light, he was the outline of a private investigator, the image of a self-made man now utterly unmade. 'Jesus,' said August. He hurried over and removed Katherine's mask. Underneath, her expression was, if anything, more wooden, apart from her eyes, which watched where he went, and not only the position of his body, but where each of his fingers went, too. 'What is she drugged with?' he asked. 'Difficult to tell,' said Seymour. 'We Dagon have potions you Westerners have never heard of. Neither have those Easterners for that matter. I can't remember them all, though they are pretty useful with human women...' August stared at him. Seymour added, '' were useful...' They tried to sit her down, but her posture had done the same stiffening as her face, and they were forced, in the end, to lie her down, white and straight and sacramental as a candle. 'What now?' asked Derleth. 'Well,' said Seymour. He quailed at what was to come, but only his wedding ring finger. The palsy didn't reach his wrist, let alone his voice. 'You said my narrative was coming to a happy ending, just not for me. Now, I become the sacrifice.' August laughed. 'You're going to pretend to be the sacrificial virgin. Who's going to believe somebody as lithe and good looking as your self hasn't been round the block a few times already?' Seymour said, 'I am a virgin, you know.' 'You know, I've seen", "label": 1}
{"text": "things that these last two years that have redefined all of existence for me,' replied August. 'You being a virgin? It's the very first time I've not been surprised.' They laughed together this time and looked at each other and their laughs and their glances met in the tent then both fell away. They studied the fish on the carpet. 'There's something wrong with those fish,' muttered August. Seymour cleared his throat by gulping several times then said, 'The butler hadn't finished dressing her. She has more jewels, more robes. By the time she was dressed, she would have looked more like a cow pi'ata, than the virgin bride she is. I can pull off the cow pi'ata look, I just need less stuffing.' 'Okay, we'll strip her off,' said August. They undressed Katherine and, with a lot of grunting and stretching and wedging, got the robes across Seymour's frame, lengthening the straps of the back and the mask to get both the dress and disguise onto his heaving frontage. 'Ah,' said August who, working his way down Seymour's bulk, had reached his feet, and had ripped open the backs of both slippers, in order to force them on. 'I'll shuffle,' said Seymour. 'I pretty much do, anyway.' 'No, it's not that. I hadn't realised your feet would be so hairy. I thought, if anything they would be scaly.' 'I'm half human, you know,' said Seymour, with some pride. 'Just that human was very hairy' and ugly.' August smiled. 'Your father?' 'No idea,' said Seymour, unsmiling. 'I don't have enough time to shave you. I'll have to...' 'Ouch.' 'Pluck.' 'What I'm thinking rhymes with that,' agreed Seymour. 'Ouch. Ouch.' He was weeping, he realised. It might have been the pain, or perhaps that he was about to kill himself. Maybe it was that somebody whom he had not previously drugged was touching his body. Two ankles later, Seymour rose and shuffled to his valise. He drew out 'Wuthering Heights,' made his way to the butler and left it on his chest. 'For his son,' he said. Then, he pushed the twin Frankensteins ' one burnt, one hale in ways he never had been - toward August. 'For her, and for you,' he said. 'To remember me by.' Next, he drew out the sausages of explosive and placed them softly in the robes about his body. There were several explosives, but he did have a lot of body to place them about. 'You can't go on your own,' said August. 'In this fog, none of them will see me coming until I'm amongst my people. By then, nobody will know I'm unaccompanied. Besides, Jack's no good for looking after anybody. You have to take care of her.' He nodded at Katherine. August nodded, looking elsewhere, top teeth on his bottom lip. 'Time to go,' said Seymour. 'Goodbye Jack.' Jack Gittes stood silently staring into the light at the centre of the tent, flinching occasionally. Seymour said, 'If you have any 'care'ing left in you, find the butler's son, stump him some money, and tell him to get out of the family business; tell him family businesses are bad for you.' Seymour left the tent without looking at August or Katherine and wended his way through the wafts and twistings of fog, following them toward their source; the waters of the dam's reservoir. The fog was lifting along with the land as he walked toward the entrance to the dam, as again was the volume of the chanting, and the frequency of fireworks overhead. The ground shook, not in response to the gunpowder, but to the bellows of the thing in the water. To say it was hungry was accurate but it was sex it craved; human meat. Here we go, he thought. He thought of the book, 'How to Win Friends and Influence People', one last time, Listen, son: I am saying this as you lie asleep, one little paw crumpled under your cheek and the blond curls stickily wet on your damp forehead. I have stolen into your room alone. Just a few minutes ago, as I sat reading my paper in the library, a stifling wave of remorse swept over me. Guiltily I came to your bedside. These are the things I was thinking son: I had been cross to you. I scolded you as you were dressing for school because you gave your face merely a dab with a towel. I took you to task for not cleaning your shoes. I called out angrily when you threw some of your things on the floor. At breakfast I found fault, too. You spilled things. You gulped down your food. You put your elbows on the table. You spread butter too thick on your bread. And as you started off to play and I made for my train, you turned and waved a hand and called, \"Good-bye, Daddy!\" and I frowned, and said in reply, \"Hold your Shoulders back!\" Then it began all over again in the late afternoon. As I came up the road I spied you, down on your knees, playing marbles. There were holes in your stockings. I humiliated you before your boy friends by marching you ahead of me to the house. Stockings were expensive'and if you had to buy them you would be more careful! Imagine that, son, from a father! Do you remember, later, when I was reading in the library, how you came in, timidly, with a sort of hurt look in your eyes? When I glanced up over my paper, impatient at the interruption, you hesitated at the door. \"What is it you want?\" I snapped. You said nothing, but ran across in one tempestuous plunge, and threw your arms around my neck and kissed me, and your small arms tightened with an affection that God had set blooming in your heart and which even neglect could not wither. And then you were gone, pattering up the stairs. Well, son, it was", "label": 1}
{"text": "shortly afterwards that my paper slipped from my hands and a terrible sickening fear came over me. What has habit been doing to me? The habit of finding fault, of reprimanding'this was my reward to you for being a boy. It was not that I did not love you; it was that I expected too much of youth. It was measuring you by the yardstick of my own years. And there was so much that was good and fine and true in your character. The little heart of you was as big as the dawn itself over the wide hills. This was shown by your spontaneous impulse to rush in and kiss me goodnight. Nothing else matters tonight, son. I have come to your bedside in the darkness, and I have knelt there, ashamed! It is a feeble atonement; I know you would not understand these things if I told them to you during your waking hours. But tomorrow I will be a real daddy! I will chum with you, and suffer when you suffer, and laugh when you laugh. I will bite my tongue when impatient words come. I will keep saying as if it were a ritual: \"He is nothing but a boy'a little boy!\" I am afraid I have visualized you as a man. Yet as I see you now, son, crumpled and weary in your cot, I see that you are still a baby. Yesterday you were in your mother's arms, your head on her shoulder. I have asked too much, too much. After Seymour left, August picked up 'How to Win Friends and Influence People' and walked to Jack Gittes. There was a feeling in him that reminded him of being young, of Wisconsin and growing up when life was simple, an apple was just and apple; a bygone life when a friend was a friend and not someone to be won, and all he ever wanted was to be a writer. Gittes stared as he approached. It seemed to Derleth that even though the private investigator did not stare at him - but through - Gittes still saw nothing. 'Listen,' Derleth said. 'Seymour' he deserves an end, he's a monster, right, he really is, but he's not all monster. The Dagon couldn't take all of him. Should we be the judges of anything? I think' I think there's a way to save him'' At that moment, he was struck across the nape with the barrel of a gun. He didn't black out instantly but stood and swayed for long enough to think he might be okay, until he felt a finger of blood creep down his spine, fingertip tapping from one vertebrae to the next. 'Forget it. It's Chinatown,' he thought he heard Gittes say, before realising that didn't make sense, and he must be passing out, which he did, collapsing on the thick-pile rug. 'They have fingers,' he whispered of the fish, before his eyes rolled and closed. Seymour was on the embankment of the dam. The concrete of it was wet and cold under Seymour's heel where his foot broke through the split white slippers Katherine was supposed to wear. Above his numbing, stumbling feet, his shins burnt and itched where the hairs had been plucked free. Under the layered robs and slinky white dress, Seymour sweated. He would have sweated just as much without the ceremonial dress, he knew. Claude Mulverhille had his arm in a pinch of heavy-set fingers. He ' Mulverhille- thought Seymour was Katherine, and so the fingers caressed him gently where they wouldn't be seen. He had said, when finding him walking alone between the tents, 'Come on, little lady, you shouldn't be out on your own at night. Especially tonight. I'll be your white knight, eh? You know, beautiful girl,' he had whispered as he led Seymour toward the hunkering concrete embankment of the dam. 'I've thought about raping you long and hard and I'd love to do it, ya know, love it almost as much as you would. But, well, who knows if that ugly fucking God of yours can feel another man's cum inside-a you when he tries to impregnate you with whatever messed up funky seed he has in gizzard. God knows, I ain't messing with that motherfucker's baby mama.' With this said he had run a hand over Seymour's ample right moob and then grunted with some surprise and more appreciation. They stood on the dam. The fog had dispersed and above him the stars were out and between them the darkness was out also, but more prevalent. Seymour was jostled by red-robed Dagon. As a magnet through iron filings he had collected them. Unlike magnetic lines, they all faced west toward the sea, toward the bulk of Cthulhu. They circled the dam, red as too much lip-stick. Ahead, Noah Cross discarded his cane and plucked up his harpoon and walked forward and the other worshippers stepped back. Despite his piscine mask, there was no mistaking his father nor that he was smiling. The waters of the dam before and below them churned and shadows rose, a multitude of shadows that Seymour realised were tentacles. Noah Cross raised the harpoon above his head and prepared to spear Seymour down and into the water. A tentacle rose, quivering slightly as a virgin boy might before a virginal girl. It touched Seymour's wide, sweaty ankle. It slid upward, prompting a rise of nausea into Seymour's throat. It touched his remaining, almost pubic leg hair. Cthulhu recoiled. Cthulhu roared in rage and, more than anything else, disappointment. Noah Cross turned to the water, then back to Seymour. Momentarily, Seymour felt a glow he could not ascribe to the incendiaries stuffed about his robes. It had taken a lot to get here. To get Noah's attention. The apple of his father's eye. A rotten one, yes, but the centre. He. Seymour. Noah Cross drew the mask from his own face then reached across and ripped the", "label": 1}
{"text": "mask from Seymour's, letting the latter drop. Both the wooden visage and Noah's own fell, and about as far as each other, Seymour thought, the mask turning chin over carved hairline into the waters of the reservoir. On the other side of the dam's wall, down in the valley, the New Year count had begun raggedly, with several 'Ten!'s scattered about the night air. 'You,' said Noah Cross. Me, thought Seymour Cross. 'Go to Hell, father,' said Seymour. Noah nodded and grinned softly as though idly pleased by the suggestion. 'I plan to bring Hell to me,' he said. 'Oh, and I'm certainly not your father. He was a fool. A bloody writer! I'm your grandfather and your brother.' Before Seymour could calculate this, a female voice screamed, 'You bastard. I'll kill you,' from behind him, from near the aperture to the gantry. 'Nine!' Seymour turned and Noah Cross glared. Even Cthulhu seemed to stop thrashing and to watch with at least a dozen of His countless eyes. Katherine Cross, the drugs no longer at work on her, raised the butler's pistol and shot several times. She missed repeatedly. 'Eight!' Snarling, she threw the pistol at Cthulhu and it smarted against one of the watching eyes. The God screamed. At Seymour's side, Claude Mulverhille joined in, raising a hand with fingers as rictus as Cross's gaping lips. Katherine had shot Mulverhille in the hand. Clawed Mulverhille, thought Seymour and would have grinned himself if Katherine hadn't snarled and burst through the worshippers, throwing herself at him. 'Seven!' The shouted numbers were converging, now. Katherine converged with Seymour. 'You bastard,' she repeated, accurately, as he buckled under if not her weight then her momentum. 'No, Katherine,' he tried to say. 'Six!' But she was throttling him and screaming, 'You rapist bastard.' 'I.. didn't... rape ' you,' he tried to reply, but recalled kidnapping her, drugging her, stripping her. It wasn't far away, he thought. Nor was the edge of the dam. Backpedalling, his right foot stepped off the concrete. 'Five!' Seymour slipped down, that foot only, and all of his heart into his stomach. 'Bastard rapist.' 'Katherine...dear, come here,' said Noah Cross, reaching for her. 'Four!' She didn't reciprocate but reached instead for Seymour. She pushed him. Seymour fell. 'Three!' 'Katherine'' said Seymour, as he fell away from her. She had been caught and saved from the drop by the clutch of Noah's free hand. 'Two!' He didn't have a hand for Seymour. 'One!' Seymour didn't have the time to hear 'Happy New Year!', had only a moment to contemplate both dwindling faces as he pitched backward; not long enough for looking at Katherine, just long enough for Noah Cross to look down on him one last time, and just long enough for Seymour to think the 'damn' of 'damnation' before he hit the ground, setting off a series of explosions from within his robes. Far above him, Noah Cross grasped Katherine and smiled a smile if not of joy then of quiet satisfaction, of thinking, 'I knew he would amount to nothing'. Then, a crack. 'Happy New Year!' drifted up the valley to the dam wall. Then again, a crack. The New Year fireworks rose above L.A. Crack. The sky turned gold, and blue, and green, and red, and twinkling, and loud. The next 'Crack', though, was still audible. Crack. Crack. The dam at its foundations began to come apart. It had sides two and a half to one, was 112 feet high and had delivered core samples that had shown that beneath this bedrock was shale similar to the permeable shale in the Van Der Lip disaster. It all- the shale bedrock, the walls- failed. The foundations gave way and with them the whole dam buttress, and those on the centre of the gantry were pitched downward into an ensuing waterfall. Beneath the reservoir, huge cracks levered up toward the hills that flanked it and Cthulhu, tentacles and eyes and all, was sucked into one of these, down in a narrow whirlpool, down into an abyss not quite like that from which He came, but nearly as dark and as deep. Moments before, August stood at the end of the dam, holding 'How to Win Friends and Influence People'. Swaying while he staggered, he had chased after Katherine. The fog was gone, but not from his ability to reason. He heard Noah Cross say, 'I'm certainly not your father. Your father was a fool. A bloody writer! I'm your grandfather and your brother.' And Katherine: 'You bastard' I'll kill you.' And then the shooting. August couldn't reach her but she got through the worshippers to Seymour and pushed him and, seeing his fall, August turned and ran- his heart running within him, his thoughts finally gathering pace. One thought repeated itself: bang! Bang! Bang! BangBangBang! Momentarily, he was proved right. August ran across the aperture to the steps, down these, along the path toward the car park. Behind and below him, there were explosions. L.A's fireworks were going off and the dam was going down. Crack, Crack, Crack, Crack, Crack. August reached Gittes's car. He got in, threw the book onto the passenger seat and tried to gun the engine, missed the ignition, found it on his second attempt. There was an inhuman bellow and the sound of a colossal bubbling rising from a colossal beast trapped in a whirlpool. August drove. There was a bump as the Ford's wheels rode over Detective Loach. Behind him, the L.A. skyline lit up with an outpouring of hope for the New Year. Bump, the back wheels bounced over Loach. Behind him, the dam finally fell. Exiting the car park, he didn't turn toward L.A., but turned right and drove through the hills. He stopped high up, opened the glove compartment, found Gittes's cigarettes, eventually lit one and smoked, calming his hands. The sky above was cloudless and the stars refracted off the hood of Gittes's Ford in a haze of misty", "label": 1}
{"text": "already up but she was trapped and the hunch of her shoulders, and twitch of her forearms showed that she knew as a cornered rabbit knows. She didn't seem to dare turn around. Seymour had risen and was behind her, moving with all his preternatural ' or, perhaps, unnatural- speed over short distances. Both his words, and the proximity from which they were whispered, made her not jump, but bend her abdomen, to curl up as tightly as possible whilst still standing. 'Um...' said Seymour. She said 'eggrrr'. '...Ah,' he added. This was difficult. He had never been a natural with humans. The row of connected seats creaked against his bulk as he shifted uneasily. The woman made a watery sound with her mouth. It may have been a sob. 'Look,' said Seymour. 'I really want to say something nice but I can't think of anything that won't frighten you, and I really want to go over there...' Seymour pointed. '' and stab that man...' Seymour pointed again, but more forcibly. 'So... ah... you smell nice.... like a fisherman wrapped in foil and cooked in limes and onions... goodbye...' Seymour looked up. Derleth, Scorer and Wandrei walked with the crowd toward the stage. Seymour's hand strayed toward his inside jacket pocket, where he kept his Smile. His people, the people of Dagon, killed in the way of deep, tumultuous, fecund waters; by closing in en masse, by ceaseless bludgeoning and, most pertinently, by asphyxiation. In his carrying of a blade, Seymour was unique. It was unlike his species to cut to the heart of the matter, even if that matter was living and human and the organ was required for sacrifice. He wheeled and inched along the aisle, and grasped the hilt of his Smile as he would this chance. August's blood would blend into the carpet. His width, however, would not let him push pass. 'Um,' he tried. 'Ah,' he attempted. Then, 'Get out of the way!' His fists bunched and the webbing between the fingers squeezed into tiny wrinkles of knuckles between the bony ones. Shimkin, the editor who had introduced Carnegie, was walking down the stairs. The Friends waited for him. Seymour was half an auditorium away. August had pulled a book from his valise. Even at this distance, Seymour recognised it. 'Shit,' he said. This he repeated as he realised who now stood at the end of the aisle he hustled down. A line had formed in the space between the seating sections, a wall of humanity waiting for Carnegie, and for his book-signing. The end of Seymour's aisle was blocked by a clot of three women he recognised first by sound. 'I kind of like him. He's sexy you know, for an older guy.' 'Yeah.' Giggle. 'Yeah.' Then by sight. He realised now he was close enough to do so, that all three had the faces of kittens embroidered into their excesses of white cloth. The first, black, the second, ginger and the third, white, outlined and whiskered in dark grey. The feline faces yawned on the drooping planes of the women's sun-hats, preened smugly while nestled between folds of crinoline. Seymour swallowed. The young women made him feel as his people killed humans, like he was suffocating. Dale Carnegie took his seat. August Derleth, holding his book, said loud enough to carry above not only the crowd, but also the three woman, '' You haven't read it, have you, Shimkin? You haven't even read it. This will be an American classic, I'm telling you.' He waved a deep-green watercolour book cover, the sight of which, when it wasn't in a pyre, gave Seymour a sinking feeling. Shimkin sneered, his grin a gash deep and dark enough to carry as August's word had and his did now. 'American classic?' Shimkin's sneer continued into his speech, the words curling at their edges as his lips did, as fire burns anthologies. 'Nobody has heard of him... what did you call him?.. Hatecraft... Likecrafty..? I don't even know his name and you haven't stopped going on about him for years. Who were we talking about? Oh yes, whoever it is.; nobody knows him, nobody will know him tomorrow, and I guarantee you standing here... actually this conversation is tiring me again I'm going to take my seat...' He did. ' ' I will guarantee you from where I sit nobody will have heard of Crafty Love in a hundred years' time.' 'Lovecraft,' shouted Derleth. 'Excuse me,' said Seymour, to the three women at the end of his aisle. His voice caught and croaked from his throat. He jiggled onto his toes (which given his weight, strained both of the smallest ones, despite the webbing that connected these to the others), wincing and searching for a last chance to strike. One of the three half turned as though hearing somebody unimportant. None of the three moved. 'Excuse me. Excuse me. Yes, it's me; the decaying frog. Hello.' When embarrassed, Seymour flushed green rather than red, and now moved several hues closer to their simile. The women talked among themselves. Shimkin shouted. 'And now compare this book, gentlemen, what do you call yourselves; pals of crafty love..?' 'Katherine would never behave this way,' hissed Seymour. 'What did he say?' The women turned, as cats do, when awoken from naps. 'Alright, alright, keep your hair on,' said one. 'Bit late for that,' said another. Laughter rippled along the line of humans, like a pebble dropped into an aqueduct. 'IT'S LOVECRAFT,' shouted August Derleth. 'WHY AREN'T YOU LISTENING TO ME YOU HUMAN WHORES?' shouted Seymour. 'H.P. LOVECRAFT!' August Derleth. 'What did he just say to us?' asked the woman embroidered with gingers. Seymour realised he had gone too far and shrunk back a step. The red red red of the auditorium walls beat down on him arterially. 'I'm really not sure,' answered the woman with white cats. The laughter separated into reverberations of nervous chuckling.

{"text": "white. August was used to apples not cigarettes so coughed, hacked and spat a wedge of mucus down the door of the car. It glittered as the hood did. Below, the dam's reservoir was mountain-tarn black and flat and drained slowly down the valley, wherein, one by one, farmstead lights went out. From this distance, August could not hear the New Year's celebrations or the screaming. Apart from the water, the world was quiet, and Derleth thought there was a time, a time even before Cthulhu, when all that could be heard was water, water, water. Below him, the flood that had carried away Seymour, Katherine, Mulverhille, and Noah Cross carried on down the valley, erasing orchard after orchard of apple trees, grove by grove. August didn't mind. He didn't have a taste for apples anymore. Instead, still smoking (and wincing at the pistol-whip of pain in his nape) August started the car and drove through the Californian hills, drove as far inland as he could without heading again toward the coast, and next to him the pages of the book fluttered to the open window of the cab, turning on their own to the very end of the book. It is naive to believe you will always get a favorable reaction from other persons when you use these approaches' But August, becoming annoyed at the 'How to Win Friends and Influence People's constant flapping, reached across and threw the book out of the open window, shouting after it, 'FICTION WINS!'

She sang as she swam with him to her chest, songs with no lyrics known to man, lyrics with letters that were alien to the world, with a sadness deeper than the void, which was where she carried him; down into the darkness between the stars.

{"text": "the Friends of Lovecraft and Seymour, unsure of whom to laugh at. 'I think it must have been rude,' said the black catted woman, becoming one dimensional once more as she was distracted by Derleth and Shimkin. Carnegie sat and began to sign books and the line started to move. Shimkin settled back down into his chair. He wasn't listening to August, but instead said, 'Carnegie's book...' Shimkin paused, and looked sidelong at Carnegie. 'Sorry Dale, I mean your book.' 'That's okay,' said Dale Carnegie, and to the man in front of him. 'Who do you want it made out to?' Shimkin went on, 'How to Win Friends and Influence People is not yet a year old and it's already in its seventh printing! And your Likes Making Arty Things with his Hands...' 'Lovecraft,' said Derleth, whose volume had also fallen. 'Has sold what... forty copies?' 'Thirty seven.' 'This book,' Shimkin was pointing at the editions of How to Make Friends and Influence People. '' and that one are different colours, you see, different editions because it's sold so many. It hasn't been out of the bestseller list since it was printed.' Shimkin's smile was feral. 'And you know why all of this is gentlemen? Fiction is dead.' The three Friends of Lovecraft recoiled. 'How dare you?' exclaimed one. Wandrei, Seymour thought, if only because the exclamation came from a higher point. 'Dead! Who wants to read made up stories from other people's heads? The lives of those we don't even know?' Nobody would be interested in mine, thought Seymour, thankfully. He had come of quite badly in Shadows over Innsmouth. He was thankful, also, that the crowd no longer noticed him, the line of humans peering at the Friends and Shimkin instead. Seymour joined the line and shuffled toward his target. Shimkin was up now, the line of a spring, and not a coiled one, but one already sprung. 'No. The books of the future, gentlemen, will be active ones, proactive ones. The audience will join in those books, like these books,' he indicated Carnegie's work. '' they will actively enhance their lives. No more sitting around passively taking things in. The great American books won't be novels, no, no they will be living, alive, doing things.' 'Ridiculous,' said August. 'You can't believe that. You've found great fiction ' great writers in the past...' 'Yes, yes,' Shimkin jabbed a finger on each yes, and the three men recoiled as though scared it might stain them. Horrified, August almost dropped the book he held. 'And I'm tired of them. Oh, I'm a genius, oh people love the froth of crap I spew out, meaningless, pointless lies. LIES! We call great art. FICTION IS LIES,' he added, as if anybody had missed his point. 'You're wrong,' Scorer said. 'Lovecraft never wrote a lie. Lovecraft will be great in time,' August whispered the first, said the second. Near the front of the line, Seymour was close enough to hear both. 'They'll be reading him long after this confidence man... sorry Sir...' 'Not a problem,' said Carnegie 'But I do suggest you read my book. You're not getting anywhere with your current approach...' '' long after anybody ever even reads the name 'Derick Carney'!' 'Um...' said Dale Carnegie. 'Out,' said Shimkin. 'I'm tired of this. You three have been hounding me for years about this pile of tripe. The only thing horrifying about this horror writer is his writing.' Scorer flushed to the circumference of his ears. Donald Wandrei drew a fist up and back. It looked as roughly wooden as the rest of him, and like it would very much hurt. 'Out!' shouted Shimkin. 'Doorman!' 'Don't bother,' said August. 'Come on, friends,' he added, and the three left, Wandrei's voice raising as his fist had. 'One hundred years! We're meeting a publisher tomorrow. It will be famous tomorrow.' 'FAMOUS?' Shimkin's mouth seemed to be stuck in shout. 'IS IT A SMALL PUBLISHER, EH? HAVE I HEARD OF THEM? NO? NO? THEN IT WON'T BE FAMOUS. NOBODY READS BOOKS FROM SMALL PUBLISHERS.' August's fist and voice rose, also. In the first was a copy of How to Win Friends and Influence People. 'AND I TOOK THIS. GOOD WRITERS BORROW. GREAT WRITERS STEAL!' Shimkin shouted in reply, 'YOU WOULDN'T KNOW A GREAT WRITER IF HE STOLE YOUR FUCKING VIRGINITY.' The three were gone and his voice lowered. 'And Lovecraft will sink without trace, like that bloody Innsmouth story should have.' Innsmouth did, in the end, thought Seymour, though not the story, unfortunately. He wheeled his bulk to follow the Friends but had reached the end of the book-signing line. There, he jerked and writhed, like a hooked fish, and just as smelly and just as caught. There was something about the end of queue's which pushed the human half of Seymour to the fore. The pressure of all those eyes behind him forced Seymour to shuffle forward toward Carnegie's desk. Failed again, he thought, of August Derleth. At least the three young human women had moved on, leaving Seymour able to breathe. Dale Carnegie looked up at Seymour. 'I think they need to read this,' he said, tilting his head and spectacles toward Shimkin and where Derleth had been. Seymour did his best to smile but had to eventually settle for a nod. 'Who do you want it made out to?' said Carnegie holding a green copy of the book. 'The F-Failure,' said Seymour, his voice shaking as though emotional. His blood pressure and need to kill had not yet subsided. Besides, Seymour never liked to talk at the front of a line. Too much pressure.

Next - page of black ink.] Part 1 29.7 At first, Toy Stones thinks the world has darkened because he accidentally killed his wife. It's hard for him to say murder is accidental, hard, yes, but no hiarder than claiming the affair with his mmothe-in-law was a case of him tripping, and falling, and finding his penis in her mouth. Tony Stones is a writer and so practised at confectng lies, most of which, like any cook, he tastes and swallows himself. Lies: a) You can make money from writing b) The affair with my mother-in-law isn't my fault c) The murder of my wife was accidental. I didn't want to kill her. I only wanted her to stop talking. While you shouldn't trust a thin chef, neither should you trust a writer who thinks they tell the truth. As a writer, he may well pen, 'the enormoity of his sin had besmirched the honey-thick summer sky, tarring its golden bubbles of light, shadowing its stickiness as much as would the shutting of a cuoboard door on the honey pot itself' Yes, you haven't heard of Tony Stones. He isn't a best seller. A product of public school and eighties suburbia, it has taken Tony thirty seven years to suspect the earth does not revolve around him, with the sun about the earth, and him at the centre of the whole, dancing solar system. Now, it takes several seconds for Tony to realise the sun has gone out, turning the lights off as it leaves. Good energy conservation, Tony would think, except that it looks very much like the end of the world. Or, at the very least, the end of days. 29 [degress Celsius] Seven seconds after the sun goes out, there is nothing to see. It looks a lot like this, [page of black ink] 29 [degrees Celsius] Four minutes before the sun goes out, the Stones sit in their own silence. Through the windsreeen the sunset is a viscous, rabid-eye red. Summer sky. The air has not yet reached the twilight bruised-purple with which the Stones had familiarity. Torn scraps of cloud, brutalised-red, lynched light. The sun hung above the horizon. It's just not going to go down, thinks Tony, it needs to be put down. Like our marriage. There is a sense of drift and white noise on the radio. Their stillness stinks of sweaty struggle, and gunge that has been left to run with the tears. The doors make a ricket-ricket noise - crickets on repeat - and the engine ticks over with a thick, watery sound like that of nicotine addict that just will not quit ' will not light out and die. The silence is theirs alone. I'm' Tony does not let his thought finish, much less say the words out loud. His breathing creeps in and out of his throat as though an adulterer into the martial sheets. If it could, his breath would elope. It wouln' be the only thing looking to elave me, thinks Tony. He glances at Joanne. She looks out at the sunset, ten back to the car ahead. It, the sun not the Skoda, is beautiful. Despite the dictations of society, fashion magazines, and his day-to-day treatment of her, so is Joanne. Tony guesses her eyes have a layer of moisture, dew on lightening grass in the dawn. He looks away. The windscreen needs a clean. Let the sun go down on me, he thinks. He smiles on one side, and that twisted. That was it. The smile feels like a final straw, a husk thick and broken. In times like these, he's more melodranmaric, he thinks, than Elton John. Than Elton! It simply wouldn't do. The smile snaps back into his mouth. This sun is not for setting. He unhitches the lever on the car door and it swings open with a rusted screech that sets his teeth, like most of him, over their edge, and reminds Tony of just how poorly his writing sells. Double whammy. It would be two of many whammies, out there, beyond the solid white line of the dual carriageway. Beeeeeeeeeeeep, beeeeeeeeeep says a car, as it passes. Road Runner's having a good old last laugh thinks Tony. Could be my last laugh. His thoughts are feet that have gone off the edge of a cliff, peddling on thin air. He sits, then twitches toward the exit. She doesn't turn. He reaches out and shuts the door. He would have walked around the boot, not the bonnet. He wouldn't have been able to bear her eyes on him. Get out. Just do it, he thinks. He doesn't. 29 Three minutes before the sun goes out, he opens the car door to get out. It isn't the first time. He doesn't have the guts to go through with it, I think. Just go, I think, glancing at him when he's half-tunred. I stop doing so, preferring the sunset. It is beautiful. -67 [degrees Celsius] Fifty-three days after the sun goes out, an astronaut walks through the snow. It is freshly fallen but hard enough, already, to crunch like fracturing bones. The sound only seems to encourage the astronaut. His visor is vacant but swollen with intent, a balled fist of rotting hatred where there should have been a face. The lights of the hospital foyer fell on it and I find myself hoping the second back up generator will go again, despite the dark and cold. Even at this distance, I could see that the only visage which would appear within, would be the reflection of me. Possibly dying. I consider running. Despite the harsh, indefatible intent of its gait, the astronaut doesn't. A space-age golem, it just keeps coming, through the freeze, the shearing wind, through the long, thick squalls of snow that looked", "label": 1}
{"text": "planning stages, nobody thought the sun would go out. I'm finding it hard to walk. My feet ahe, and my legs, and everything else above. The drive hasn;'t been easy, even only from Yorkshire. The eyes have seen the worst of it. A child, blonde, me twenty years previously, stood beside a burning car, screaming 'daddy'. I stopped, though my corsa was full. Couldn't help stopping, but she was gone. For the life f me I have been attemping not to guess where, or how. I like to think she didn't go in after him. My haed aches as though it has been attempin g to digest the events of the evening. The result of which isn't indigection but the kin d of mihraine that would be glasd to hear that he sun has gone, even if forever. I am at the nurses station. 'I'm going now.' He could come or not. I tended to hope for the second, though I found it hard to care, anymore, but knew he would make the calculation; public transport on a nmight like this, and come with me, in the neighbouring seat. Learning to drive was supposed to give me indepence. Instead, it has given my life a passenger. 'Look, I know you must be busy, an evening like this,' eh was talking to the nurse again. I considered simply walking awayu. It was hard these days, We owned property together, and like that man in the poe story, it had bricked thme both in together, seemingly forever. Fucking housing markjeyt. 'Please, I need to see my Mum.' 'It's not visiting time.' With the bad timing if an apocapyse, of this evening, two men exited the doors to the ward. Tony's head thrust forward again. Peck-peck-peck, UI thinl' Soonm here'll be nothing keft of you, either, I think, thinking of the nurse. I feel hollowm, except, of course, for the pain. There's despir as well, but that has an surpirsin emtiness of its own, that ofa hole in a darkened sky. 'I'[m goiung to go,' I said. It was difficult to hear, even for myself,. There was a whining. I realpies it is my ex. 'Please,' he doesn't refer to the men. They frighten him, I can tell. He's a black belt, and all; I can fight, and I've had street fights, but faced with men shaved bald and swollen foreheads, and scarred by childhoods that keep their eyes jangling in their sockets, he backs down. He's a coward,a nd not just deep down inside. Not the only way in which he has the featires of a chicken, I think. He wants to say; how cvome thwy can back there, they're clearly no t staff, and I can#'t. I recognise them, though TYony properl;y doesn'. He never sees the little people, especially the northerners, and most especially the mans. He's a pucblished authpr, you know, and though he moks this, polishing up his already posh accent as eh does so, theres more than a seed of truth in his faux-arrogance. More lkike a fully grown oak. 'Fine,' I said, louder than I intended. One of the men turn to look at me, his dark eyes like burning pitch roiling across my skin. I blush. I turn from him. I can't help but agree with Tony's fear. They are gone, into the lift. I head toward the stairs. Lifts scare me, and never more so than when there are men like those two, in them. I am unsure why, as I am of why I sometimes can't get out of bed, or find myself crying, in the bath. My therapist has been little help, as ever. I go. 'Fine. And thanks for all your help,' Tony said,. He would be reddening, as ever he does when he drops the mask of charm. And it is a pretence, I should know. He goes down the stairs two behind me, talking. But then, he's always talking, and, like a bloody writerm he thinks people are interestedm, I SUPOPOSE. His books sales, and the way I don't reply, would suggest otherwise. The house despite being a semi in an insiopid suburb had character. Character in spades, thought Tony Stone, thinking, as he so often did, that he was turning a new phrase' It's buried us alive. The mortar had sealed them in, like two hearts in a Poe story rather than one. There was too much equity to lose, no matter that Tony had already lost the kind of things people said you couldn't put a price on. Her love. Ingrity. The knowledge that had never cheated on a woman. There gad been that, at elast, and that, now, on top of everything else he had called his own, was gone. Tony walked up the stairts. His mood did not rise with his body, and his knees and thighs struggled aganst the meagre, repetive domestic climb as though they felt there was no point, any more, even in these little things. Maybe it was the sun going out that had dampenede his spirits, he considered. Maybe it was the house itstself. There lack of love for each other ad, as if to an unwanted child, transferred itself to the bricks and nmortar. Chipped paint in grey, zombie fingerprints. Used to be, there was life hear, the prints said. Scarred paintwork as though nails had been run along ythre walls. Dust had built up in the niches of the steps he tranversed, like the hair of an old, balding man, furring around the edges, worn down in the centre of the steps. There were bits on the floor which neither of them could be bothered to hoover. They picked at his eyes, and at what remained of his self worth. Tony thought of a corpse, vultures. He had reached the landing. Once, every one of the rooms, from the lounge to this landing, had been baptised by their love. The relationship had long since moved on, through marriage,", "label": 1}
{"text": "to a stainin g of each room with words that shuld not have been said. Bile shed. Number five, Limber Close smelt of vague damp, like a large plant had crawled in, somewhere, and died, and of memories that were rotten when they had been minted. The hosue, though small, stretched oput around him as if it would never end. No point trying to sell it now, thought tony. God only knows what an apocalypse does to house prices. He ould hear the sound of his wifes fingers ona keyboard. She had shut the door to the study. The door, the white wood, the way it was rammed against eh am, seemed final. The crackle of the keyboard was relentless. Tony had an image of onny in the Shining, tyoing over and over 'All work and no play all work and no play..' but with 'hate' and his name. It's over, he knew. Today had put a nail in it. The way she had treated him, especially in the car, especially in front of strangers, the way she looiked down at him' Tony's mind was no stranger to this line of thought, nopr to this place on the landing, where he stood and listened to the sound of what their relationbship was now. Her facebooking her friends, not in secret, but in privacy, her words nebulous as the internet itself; 'I really don't know how long we can go on like this' I hate to say it but he really is such an arsehole' God, I'm just sick of this, I know it sound petty, but'' She had barred Tony. He looked upward. The bulb, bare at this angle in its basque of plastic made to resemble metal, hurt his eyes. He squinted and imagined he was looking at a small sun. His imagnationn was convincing enough and he saw only a bulb through eyelashes. A moth battered against, fingernail-flicks of its wings. Tony wondered what the moths would do, during the day, without the sun. It couldn't get into the bulb, try as it might. Grimacing, Tony looked down. The stairs were dirty, moth balled in dust. He walked down them and into the kitchen and, reaching into his pocket, retirved his mobile phone. He felt ashudder going through the artery of that wrist, as though his blood were repelled by the Nokia. Inside, he sloshed, his gutsm his heart. H looked up, again, but not this time at the bulnb, but to allow the tears to sink back in. They did. Not a droped was spilt on his cheeks. He clenched these, and his teeth, and found his father's number on the mobile. It was time, now that his widfe could not hear Tony. He would tell him that his marriage was over. He had been putting this off. He pressed dial but the phone beeped, reading 'network busty' on the displayt. It must be the sun going out, he thought. Everybody phoning their loved ones. He sighed with relief. He hadn't really wanted to do this. Somehow, it was harder than the slow, fractured goodbye. He couln't recall the last time he had talked to his family on the phone. In this house, he had been reduced firs to a whiper, then a whuimper, now silence. If this place had characterm it was that of an abusive matriach, waiting on the edge of thesette withn her lips curling and ust waiting, just waiting for an excuse to throw something. Go on, love, just give me a reason. His lother inlaw, in other words. Tony unlocked the back door and walked into the yard. Butressed by housing, it was little;e more than a spit of concrete, but it wasn't overlooked. Like an oubliette, it had become Rony's private place. Itw as quiet out here. Shouldn't the end of the world be noisier? Yhe questionw as aFRankenstenien twitch, but the life soon went out of it. Tony stared at the stars. He was quite unable to name them. The night balmed the skin of his cheeks and forehead with hits summnery warmth. The skin there replied with a flush of slight sunburn. He had laid back in his sister-on-laws garden, that afternoon, taking in the rays, ignoring family members that were soon to become ex, the looks that said they knew, baskin in the momemtn, because everyone after this was overcast. Glad I did that now, he thought, and smiled at the stars. He fixed ion staying there, gradually cooling like a staue on a tuscan hill fter sundown, and wait for the sun to reappear. He spun on his heel. The heavens spun with him, as though he were the prick of a pinpoint, and the sky its head, and on that all the angels balanced. I feel like a prick, he added, thinking of his siste in law and her downstairs toilet. His calves began to ache and he gave up and went back in, lying on the couch, and switche through TV channels. News. News. News. From Ireland, a nship in the Stlantic. East coast. All reporters standing as though at gigs where the sar attraction didn't show, not once. The sun spent the night not rising and Tont fell asleep in dribbles, waking to Los Angeles, darkness, Cash in the Attic, then to Tkyo, everythim darkness. Exhausted pitch, bunched and ancient as Miss Havisham's veklvet drapes. It was late morning when Tony awoke. It was still night. Rnnnrrnngg rrrrnnngggnnngg He would say he was influenced by Stephen King, at boom readionsg where nobody went. First bare light, like a slap across the corneas. Then darkness, like the televoision broadcasts from New York, from Moswcow. Then pain, in a rachet at the place where his spine was levered to the side, his head on th arm of the settee. The sound eturned. Nggggnnnngggg. Nnnnnnngggnnn'nngggnnng. This is Misery, he thought, before the shout of, 'Are you going to get that or what?' It hadn't beeen his lips.", "label": 1}

Thick and grited as the leepy to the left and right of each eye. He remembered where he was. That they till lived together. Misery, he recllaed. Bfore he remembered what had happened to the sun. Rnnnnggggg. The phone stopped its ringing. He was up, not on his feet, but on his bottom, sitting strauight, before his head had properly registered that itw as awak. Stars made constellations before his eyes and he closed them and the stars went green and big as fish mouths, gping, and vlowing bubbles across the darkness behind his loids. He stretched,a nd, lookin g once moere, turned to the curtains that were always shut. That meant something, he thought, as he twitched them open, I'm a LAYABAOUT, A good-for-nothing, unemployed, and benefit scrounger. Another world, all of it. It was. The street light where on and the range that fell fom them seemdd spread thin, as if too little marmalade over too much toast. One winked as though it wished to go out, knowing, perhaps, that it had overstayed its allotted welcome. Tony had felt like thatm especially after fucking his sister-in-law. How couldn't they smell it>? He had thought. 'God, this room stinks,' his wife said. Tony tuened in a jolt. Behind her was the TV set,w ith an image of the international space station. It floated in the void, outlined only in lights, like the Christmas tree of a dovorcee, small, same colour lights. His blood finished opltin in his veins, sl;oshing back to fill his heart. He felt abruptly like crying and hid it by yawning, placing his hands to his face. 'When you finally get up, you might want to think about gettimg some food in,' said Jo. Her brown eye sratcheted to the right. Against the pale skin of her temples, flanked by curls of blonde, they looked like they didn't belong, didn't want to be here. YTony guessed they both knew how that felt. 'Food is going get in shirt supply. There's been tweets about Tesco running out of tins, beans, and shoit alreaduy. I'm going to my Mum's, so it's up to you. But if you're staying here, you might want to have something to eat.' Her eyes rebounded to hinm. He could have sworn the pupils narrowed and wondered iuf that was tge physiologically signage of hate. 'No skin of my nose, one way or another.' Tony had thought, a few months into their relationship ' ever since no lomnger thinking it cute ' that her nose was overlong and could do with losing some skin. 'Who was on the phone?' 'I don't know. I didn't answer it,' he tried to say. The soreness in his throat mothballed the words, and he tried again. 'Don't know,' he said. She shrugged. DShe was halfway to the door, halfway through it. 'I'm be leaving for Yorshire later to' later.' Her vouce softened. There was a softness, there, always,w asn't there, a rotten centre to heir divorce that had kept them sumped together. Tony hated the hope he felt when he heard it. 'Look, I can take you as far as the metro, if you'd like. You'll be wanting to see your mum, won't you,. At the hospital.' 'Yeah, thanks. That would be nice of you.' The brown eyes didn't seem to like the thought of being noe, and hardened, as sod tramped down over a corpse. 'Yeah,' she added, and left. Her feet were heavy on the stairs. Tony put his hands to the sides of his face. His unshaved cheeks were a mismatch of hairs, long and short. He plucked at them for awhile, seeking a perfection that existed nowhere else in his life. His fingers began to crimp, his neck bubbling with a rahs, and he rose. There was alwaysa another hair. He padded to the phone. Somehow, over the years, his footsteps had taken the opposite position to that of his wife's quietening as er became thickset, whispering the more they shouted at each other. Their house was an eggshell, walked from the inside, but no matter how careful he was, there was always another argument, anther crack. His feet felt frayed, his tether broke all the more often, these days. Tony picked up the phone. The handset hummed into his ear, a continousous note. He dialled 1471. The hum continued. Tony stared at the grey plastic. He was red, stained with Bolognese, he guseed, most things in the hosue where stained by something. It looked like old blood, as though, at some point, the phone had been wounded, cut by one word or other. He jiggered the button, of on, off. The hum continued, like a sself-important fridge,. The cars on the M60, the rising sound of insanity at the base of his skull. He slammed the receiver closed on the set, and licked his lips, delicatelely. He realised he did this, whenever he threew an iten back at her, as if they neded a little deloicay in this place, and his ongue would hav e to do what his hands would not., anymore. He pulled at his phone from the pocket of his jeans. He had slept in them and the phone had wedged in behind his cards. He kept everything in the left pocket, the bottom of the right hd long since dropped out. He should buty a new pair, but he wouyld need money for solicitors when she got round to seeing them. He laughed, short and wooden, the bark of a dog swiftly kicked. Upstairts she slammed the door to study shut. Solicitors, he thought. In the apocalypase.

The night sky abed at him, as though the lottery hand (shouting 'It shuld be blue!') and staggered in the porch. Thatw as a surprise,e he thought, the shock, as though his body, upon seeing that the sun had gone, could not give uo as easily as his mind,. With a new years tush of beeps, his phone filled with text messages. He looked. ASre you okay? Where are you? Can you come down? How's Jo? All rom his father. Nobody else. There's had been the kind of marriage that burnt bridges ot the oputdide. Dad, Tony noticed, had asked about her last. She had never liked him, nor his mother, and it was the latter that had always worrird him. Bad siogn, Tony thought, looking at the dark smudge fo where the sun should be, floating across the sky like liqurice melting on a frying pan. 'hello?' said a voice to his lefyt, thriought he bushes. @hello?' Itw as cracked with age, quereous, and shot through with busybodyness. 'Hello?'

'Fine, fine, can't complain. I used to libve ina bungalow, you know, really lovely house, but my daughter in law thought I should live here. Nearer to them, and all. Right hard getting up the stairs in the cold nights.' Tony stared at her. It's always blody night, heis mind seethed. 'What's your anme, again? I'm always forgetting.' 'Tony,' said Tony. 'I'm ust popping ouit tot eh shops.#' his feet made as if to move. 'Can't believe the weather recently,' said Vivian. Itw as never going to be that easy. 'No, Tony found himself sayinf, 'Crazy isn't it.' 'Mad.' Agreed Vivian. 'Do you think we'll see a bit of sun any time soon?' Tony felt a scream coming up his windpipe and quickly said, 'Not with Manchexzter weather, eh? Rain, rain rain.' 'S'pose so,'s aid Vivian. She turned away. ;Can't stay and chat, though, must get on.' 'Bye.' Said Tony. Viviam didn't reply and Tony rubbed his face with his palms, scoruing his hair with his fin gers. The face felt platicy and unfamiliar. The hair was ust as thick and messy as ever. The scream, at elastm, erecede into his belly, and, in its steadm, goose bumps ranged around his skin like free range poulty. He was wearing the same blue hoodie as yesterday and zipped it, now, as he walked up Linbver Close and turnmed right toward the shops. There was a grouop, nbbehidn bhim and to the left, but he didn't look. Tony wasn't a big man and he had loomng since found that loking made people look back. 'Oi, hoodie,' one shouted. Laughter. Tony's back crawled with it, as though withn leeches. It thinned him, his heart curling up inside his chesta dn looking for a rib behin d which to hide. 'Hoodie, hoodie, blue hoodie,' another sang. Laughter. He imagined baggy, gaping mouths like shirt sleeves several sizes too big for the extra small frame of humour on which it hung. Tony's footsteps spurted forward along with his adrenalin. 'Hoodie,' giggle, 'coward.' Police sirens battered the air blue. They were at the end of the road he stood om, as were the shops. The smashing of glass cracked down the intervening space. Why weren't the police stopping, the thought, He didn't like to think what was happening further down that road. A man in a grey hoodie and grey ogging pants sprints down the middle of the street, carrying a bottle of White Lightning, and a box of Frosties. Tony couldn't help but think, Milk! Tony turnrd left, into a sideroad, away from the corner shop and toward another. YTony was a writer, and was more used to withdrawing than meeting the world head on. Tony wouldn't have called himself a coward, but others did, and his wife most often, among them. Eventaullay, in a loop of pavement, he passed the shops,a nd the crowd outside it. Tony walked around the roads, passed shops but like the moth at yesterday' bulb, he never entered. There was something Darwinian about looting, he would think walking past each one, survival of the fittest. It was never little old ladies, or men, like him, with glasses, height issues, or hair. The apocaplyse was like winning a world cu;p he decide, pithily, everybody out on the streets, brought together, except all those who weren't. He didn't dare look at them, but through the cornesr of his eyes. His vision fuzzed and darkened as thgough withdrawing into the housing of his brain, turning off the lightsas it went. The writer in Tonyw as used to up and leaving his body, going out of body, and it did so, now, leaving the lights off in himseld, drifting toward the garishly liughted dacade of the 7-10. He tripped on a wonky tooth of fkagstone, but kept going. His head ecohoe,d empty. He walked across the road, not looking left or right or at the looters. He didn't see the black cat that crossed at his feet and failed to touch wood (his forehead) as he would normally. He didn't quite feel himself.

There was the soft bubbling of guts going the wrong way, and the screa,m became a choke.

The looters had an were turning. Tony hadc made the furthest pavemenht. He didn;'t turn to look. His imaginationwas more than enough. He staggered around a post box and back into the street than ran to his own. Men in tacksuits with no hair and boxes of stella ran down toward the blur in Tony's perceptyion that was the cat. Its blackness desceneded and seemd to eat at the world around it. He heard, 'That car ust kept gon g,' 'The bgastards,' 'It's not going to make it,' 'Look at him, ust ognoring that porr cat,' 'Look at him, running away,' 'hooide, blue hoodie, hoodie.' Breaking, as did his mind, into a scattred run, he hared along the pavement, his eyes bulging before the rest of his body, willing ti on, his mouth saying, 'sorry, sorry, sorry.'

'Coward,' said Tony. He didn't know who he was shouting at, but he kept running into the words. 'Coward, coward.' The duvet wwas banked up aroundme as loam around the places where small animals go, to hiberdate or to die. The heaped contact is not just the covers, but in the stench of me, which has accumalted over the weeks since I have changed these. It is dark in here. The curtains are drawn. A black hole of my own making. I would feel embarrassed, if I wasn't so ashamed. The lights in the room are off and the air of it is heavy with despair as a summer meadow wuith pollen. To it, I am dsmay-feveered, weeping, unable to breathe, wishing my lungs would just shut down. I lie fuully clothed and if I will be able to ris,e this time, the third of what is supposed to be the morning. I find it hard to raise enthusiasm for the night. Despite being fully clothed and having somewhere I desperately want to go. Away from here, from him. Home.My herat is a crushed can of red bull inside, crumpled where once it had been pressurised with ' and ' and garish, flourescent hope - all the chemicals of the high. Inside, my wings are broken in several places and clipped halway along their span. Tony had been out too long. 'Tony' is the first word on the new page of my journal. Though daek, I can still see it, on the orther pillow. My pen bars its closing and the word is large and kjagged and deep, an inky slit uike the depths of an abyss below the sea, but not so long or lrga eas the word it accompanies 'arsehole'. The white paper is a pallid, shaven upper lip emabrrsed by the words scrawled over it, seeming to withdraw, as lips and nostrils from something rotten. 'Tony is an arsehole. At first, He looks likt eht best kind of person. He relies of his quick grin (antisocial charmer's smile) and blue eyes to hide the fact that he is the worst.' 'Arsehole.' The last was written as much vertically as horizontally, graffiti more than journaling. My knuckles still ache from scribving oit. The muscle sof my uipper back and shoulders scramble amongst each other, the loose scree of a rockslide. S remember what my therapist has told me, and Chinese burn onbe hand around anither, massage the impression of freidnly hands into my wrist. As if somebody out there cares. As if. A snap shot iof my mother, as much grapseshot as anything, pepsr my brain, holing my consciousness. It feels every time I crawl in her andcan't get out,. That my world is ending. I don't think I have the enrgy to get up and start again,. Somehow, though, I always do. This itm,e however, the world was really over. This made it easier to get up. Tony had been gone too long. I wasn't goin g to wait for him, anymore. \\I ;ve been waitin for him for years. For him to stop swearingat me, saying that I'm 'pissing and moaning' evry time I cry. To leave, like any decent man would. I have to get out. I roll right, then left, a tiger ina tiny cotton cage. My journal snaps closed, the pen rolling out then lost in the ruffs of duvet. I turn asgain, my back and ache that goes up and around my scalp to my eyes. I rise in a Meths 'man judder of limbs, needle sharp and cold, rattling around the bedroom, piling my clothes into a gym bag. I've never used the gym before but have the bag, several times. It is the most useful part of the subscription. I am a rash of motion, my skin red and impatient for the get go, a though it wouldf puyll itself off my frame and dtive away, on its own, if I don't hurry up. Now, I want him to take longer. The premonmitioned bang of the front opening/closing as an over-heavy beat of my heart. My nerves are coiled, the wiring of a bomb, non e of them yellow, all live, ready to blow.

The ghostlineess, I notivce in passing him, is in his eyes; as though they have forseen his own demise. 'Get it,' I say, as I go by, 'if youw anta lift.' Further down Bury New Road, the lights of police vans banaged the night in swathes of blue. This is her fault, thought Tpny, but couldn't think of one good reason why. His mind sought to pin blame on her, as a blinded kraken playing pin the tentacle on the ship. He missed. He swung. 'We should have gone along Bury Old Road,' he said. It was the most pointed he could be, without her breaking him off. She ignored him. The dark between TFO and the Esso, down under the metro bridge, was inky with black, and wet with rain. The world, in the spaces between the orange street lamps, had th consistency of chewed liquorice. 'We'll never get there,' said Tony. Joanne turned up Capital FM, on the radio. Theyw ere playing Texas, after Elton John 'Don';t Let the Dun Go Down on Me'. Tony guessed Mr brightside, next. The song faded to an audio black shot through with sirens outside the corsa, and the DJ said, 'That's complaint number seven.' His voice slurred across the speakers, as the sirens went the opposite direction. Ckoth edged where they were sharp, and cutting. 'Well, I'm so fucking sorry, but it's the end of the world. What do you fucking want radio four. Your more than bloody welcome to them. According to radio bloody four there'es been multiple outbreaks of looting and rioting, la-di-dah and the peasants are revolting because they want some cake to eat. The apocalypse brings out the scum in people, darlings didn't you know. And that's the fucking news. The' sun.. has.., gone' out. Should have been the daughter, shouln't it, cause women always leave, right?' slurp, gulp., Tony couldn't help but agree. He grinned, wide enogyu, he hioped for Joanne to notice. 'Here's the traffic, don't go out, it's simplky death ouyt there darlings. So, I don't know about you, but I'm locked up in here, security's not going to answer at receiptin cause theyr'e dick deep in the recitonist. Lovely hgirl, Zara. And here's what I'm going to do,' there was a pause in which gulping could be heard, and the crinkle of an aluminium can that sounded too dented and empty to carry on. 'I'm going to play the excellent Soundgarden with, yes, that's right, it could only be Blacvk Hole Sun.' No Brightside, thought Tony. 'What's going on?' asked Tony. She didn't reply. 'Have you seen that crowd outside Tesco's?' Again, no response. He resolved to remain quiet. There was a enough of a sense of a hole about the night withbout digging another one fo his own. Past the traffic lights, across the mni-roundabput, the front of the sup[erm,arlet was visible, or it's roof was, its windows obscured by humanituy cast into a silhoutee of mass by the lights within and the dark without. Here and there between the growth thatw as ten cxrowd, luminous police vests could eb seen bobbing, but too few, like buoys before a tsunami. Glass shattered and mouths screams. It didn't from this didtsnace, cut together with sirens, and presented on the tableu of pitch black fear, sound like terror, but more feral. A collective feeding frenzy. No better place for it than Tesco's, thought Tony, while an image of ranked vampires from I Am Legend eneterd his a nother part, and woulnd't move on. 'I'm not going there,' he said, his resolve shredded. 'I'm going to turn around when I can,' she said. 'And on the motorway.' He didn't need to look at her eeys to see that they would be wide, wild, distant. Se would be as much goine, in her thoguths, as she was, in their relationship. 'It's probably just as busy tehere,' he meant to say, but only got as far as 'It's probably'' When a flame drahon fired itnot he night. Therew as an explosive blasta dn a primordial leap to his heart, fasta s a gheko. Anoryer erution followed he first, each kept close as Smaiug's ire in his ,koutnain, by the roof of the petrol station. One after another, Tesco's petrol station became the kind of bonfire eyes could not believe they were seeing. Brains, up and down Bury New Road, struggled to cram everything in and the line fo traffic juddered into a jam. Further along, the police vans had given up on all but their sirens and shapes, black on black, limned by white seroial numbers, ran toward the supermarket. To their right, a man carrying a petrol can rn the opposite way, toward the roundaboput their corsa had just circled. His jacket was on fire, and he seemd not to know it, running as fast as he could from the flames but taking them with them. Tony tuend, unable to twust and watch. There was a further shock, and the sound of a can ratrtling across the tarmac. 'I've got to get out of here,' aaid Jpoanne. 'Why did I agree to bring you. Nothig good ever happens when I try to help other people.' Furthert off, a steeple clanging in Prestwich, obfused by the clamour of the road ahead, interferebce leaking through, as thougn God were communicating but all the metal above their heads were nbblcoking out the signal. It lolled lopsidedly and ata frntic pace, as would a bell lobbed down a hill. Decidly, thought Tony, thingds were not going uphill. Sweat dampemned Tony's jeans,a nd beneath them, the edge of the seat was an imposition into his thighs. His legs ached, as though they longed to run. Joanne turned to him. 'This is your fault,' she said.'If it", "label": 1}
{"text": "wasn't you we wouldn't be here at all.' 'And I supoose you'll blame me for the sun going ou next, won't you, you bitch,'Tony said, befor wehe ad begun to think let alone realised what he was about to say. She turned away. 'Get out, ;s ehs said. Tony gulpd, but his ehadc went in the reverse direction tot eh saliva, his chin jutting forward, his fears pushed foerqwrd, exposed and vulnerable on his features. 'I'm sorry.;' The words felt well worn, his tingue ploughed by their progress until it was furrowed. There wasn't a seed of respite on her face. If their relationship was a crop, it had long ago been blighted. 'Get out,' she said. Tony's hands strayed left to the handle, hbis eyes to the right, to her. Everything in between coiled, twisted until it began to fray. His eyes bulged, filling with liquid, stretching from the brain that could not cope with what they saw, the retinal tendons at full strain, as though ropes ona rack. He was scared, he had to admit. He didn't want to stay, he wanted to walk away, but he was afraid of what he would run into, out there, tonight. 'You can't make me,' he said. You going to through stuff at me again,. To get me out, are you? You know those tests you had, that said you gad a bloody male brain?' There was an edge to his voice, like the window washers, even he could hear- it 'plasticy, divorced from as she soon would be, dripping with bile. He, all of him, to his bottom on his seat, to the way his flesh sat on his boens, felt on edge. 'Maybe I'm the wife, eh, and you're thre beater?' 'Get' out.' There was a finality to her tone, Being a writer, he read into it other words. They weren't 'of this car,' but were 'of this fucking relationship, you bastard.' He tipped over, from fear to anger, and unhitched the door, and tried to rise. Jerked back, he unclichked his seat belt, and, his skin feeling the colour of the stop lights scattered in front like autumn elaves against a dreay window pane, and spat on my the sky, he stepped into the road. A horn blared to his, left despite the lines of traffic not moving any where. The car's owner gunned the engine,a dn the tyres of the car to his side leered forward ont eh s;icked tarmac. He didn't look. Won't give them the pleasure, he thought. Too scared they might get out, he knew. He wiped rain water from his eyes. It was rain water. It smelt acrid, his hand as it ssed by his wife, and he rememberd an old comic strip ('Is rain when God sweats too much') He should be sweating, now. He addedm, top himself, the big show at the end of the world is coming. He walked inbetween the cars, exposed on their headflights as any butterfly on a leipodstursts torch. His limbs were thickenin, filled with the starch of adrenaline. It felt as though his muscles gave a crinkling sound, as they moved, though it was hard to hear anything above the tumult of hors, engines, fire, screams, the blast of a gun. As if shot, Tony's attention came back from the gun shot further across the road, as though he had been blown across it. His heart spasmed blood into his forearms, of all he places, he could feel it, hot, angling. He looked about. Left, right, behind. Two figures were walking between the cars. One wave a stubby shadow. For senthign so short itw as gravid with threat. Tony bent and scurried forward then, like atrapped beetle, back, loping low toward the corsa. His back crawled with the impression that a bullet might enter it, and he wished it were more like a beetle's. The men were closing. He reached the side window, bnged, one palm flat on the glass. Stop this, it seemd to sign. His wife took one glance, then looked away. He banged once. This was followed by another gunshot. Perhaps she had not heard the first,. He thought, as she turned, eyes widening and whitening. She leant doble and cracked open the door. He slid in, closded it, locked it. 'Thank you, thank you,' he nsaid. 'Where are they? Was that a gun?' By the first question, he guessed she knew the snaswer to the second. 'Are you alright?' she asked. His lungs opened wide in grautuyde, as if tey tried to hug her, Reapproachment always felt like this. The sex was even better. 'Yes, thanks,' he said. He moved on from the emotion. Her concern would only last so long, he knew, before zshe recalled 2what she thought of him. He distracted. ;'Can we get out. Can't you do a u-turn?' He was still hunched, a bug as much as a man. Yes, tht was what she though tof him. Teg glint was back in her eye, the shield coming up, she looked away. 'Yeah, how am I meant to do that? this sin't the bloody batmobile.' There was a knock against the windo, beside Tony's head. It sounded final,a nd felt like wetting himself. Momentarily, he realiseda spurt had emerged into his boxers. 'Shit,' he said. Thwe gun was gone. The image of it, vague in the dark, smoked still in her mind, burning with its own heat. 'Open the door,' I said. Tony's chin was fodoin g its chicken dance, peck, gulp, forward, gulp. Tony liked to think himself a man who was afraid of no other, a publishe casuthor no less, who weas intelligent enough, wasn't he, to ouwit anybody. Normally, I like to atch as he is symied by the kind fo men standing outsid,e now, but nornmally is not a ight like this which goess on forever filled with fire and gloch and gunshot, and men like this m,en I know because I grew up", "label": 1}

My uncle is away for attemoted murder, after all, and the stickiness of my palm on the wheel, the way in which my tongue adheres to my gums, they remind me of my childhood and, and Uncle Tommy. 'Open the door?' he says , 'you're crazy aren't you, fucking round the loony tunes bend.' He is whispering when, in our house, he would have shouted, still, apart from the th bob-bob of his adam;s apple, when behind closed doors he would leer forward, redden, wheel his arms about his head like a windmill that had gone mad. He reddens, now, as I lean across and open the door. 'Wha'' he manages, before the air intrudes,a dn bis voice would be heard by the men. 'Hi, John, isn't it? Johnny?' The taller one is rogueishly handsome asnd hard to forget. It in't because tony is male that he has done so, nor that he is a publishe author, you, know, and who remembers the little people. Iut is because Johnny is northern, and common to boot, and not someone with whom Tony's mind would wish to associate, or memorise. The shorter man is rogueishly scarred, cut as a mugger might be, and ugly as anybody you wouldn't want to meet in an alley. 'Aye,' said Johny. 'Joanne in't it, love. And'' a glint, there, in Johny's eyes, like that at the barrel of the gun,. When he had slid it into his hip-length, khaki green jacket. 'Tonmy, rigt, mate?' Tony is a statue trying top crumble into the car seat. A hand is extended toward him. I can't help but think , a gun toting hand. Tony wipes his own on the jeans, an action too obvious, it elcits the smile on Johny's lips, the scorn in his eyes, and shakes in return. He holds on, it seems, to me, too long,and grips too tight, as if to deny his cowardice, but Johny's eyes show only steely grey, and not even the scorn. 'You remember my brother, Chrissy?' 'Aye,' I say, the accent of my tingue slipping into fmiloar grooves. 'Aye,' said Tony. It is a bark, too short. He lips don't seem to be able to breathe and speak at the same time, or , at elast, not well. It must shake his confidence in himself, I think. It should. 'Alright love, mate,' said Chrissy. Hi eyes are not visible, shadowerd by his forhead, but something about the twitch of his cheeks, the way they refuse to settle around the words, tells me it is good I cannot see their expression. Tony's words come back to me, acidic, with the pungency of vomit, 'round the loony tunes bend'. He is r4estless on his feet, in the actions of his hands, and had the loomof a man who, if he were kicking or hitting you, wouldn't know how to stop. 'Hey,' I turn down the radio,. I'm trying to keep my voice level, and to disguise my gulps by lowering my chin, wiping my nose. The radio wasn't helping, not now the Dj had begun to sob. 'Why don;'t you hop in. Going to the hospital, right?' 'Yeah,' said Johnny. His smile added to his charm and detracted from the memory of the gun inside his jacket. Beyond the breasts of dusky green she could see a man u, shirtm, not this season's, but the kind Cantona ou;d have worn when giving a man a kick in the chest. 'Going to visit your mum?' Tony turned to me, his lips loosening, falling open, his bleu eyes watery with shock, as though slapped. 'Yeah, got to don't you, you know, time like this?' 'Sure,' said Jonny. His brother was silent. OR he w as swearinf under his breath. I can't quite tell, and dion't want to. 'Got to,r ight. Only thing yopu can do, get to your love ones. We're going to see our Dad, right.' 'Sure,' I say. Neirther Tony nor his lips were getting it togther. Poiintedly, I poked himand said, ' Go on sweetheart, get out and le Johhnny in the front. His legs are too long for the back, we'd have to fold him up like a deckchair.' Johnny laughed. Iw as waiting for that and do the same. Dirty, low, long, just the way my uncle used to like. I don't push Tony, but he exits the car as if I have, or the leis I can tell repel him. Two norths, then I think, and the face of my mother returns to me thoughts, how they would disappear together, her and Tpny,a nd be goen too long. I push away the thought of them. Tony has forgotten himself, his souythern charm, his twinkly public school act. Johnny cranks the lever on the side of the orsa's seat and ushers him. 'Your car mate, thanks for giving up the front, though. Think I'd be eating my kneecaps back there.' 'That's'' Tony ahs lost it, the sentence, along with the rest. He gets in. he is the red he goes when he will shout at me later. I don;'t care. He should remember how much danger we're in. I smile at Johnny, tyhen Chrissy, who, I don';t think anyway, is looking at me. 'Lucky us running into each like this,' I aid. 'What are the odds, but you said you lievd round here, I forgot.' My voice is running on. My tongue, my the sound of it, is all too aware of the gun. I seem to my at a height far above it, and not just the distance of my brain, ,listening from on high at its sounbd. Listen to me prattling,' I said. 'I lughed. Weird evening, senind me' round the loony tunes bend 'a bit nuts,' I finish. I glance at Chrissy, but he doesn't react. He gets in,a nd his eyes are visible in passing, ass grey as his brothers' but that of a the skin of a dead corpse. There", "label": 1}

In the back seat he and Tony are pent up breath, like a victim and serial in a horror film, int eh same cellar. Johnny shuts the door. It creaks in protest. I can't hear Tony so much as breathe. We wait. TGime stretches out liem agarotte wire. I gulp and finds even that hard. 'Sorry, love,' said Johnny. 'I don't ant to be a back seat driver, butg why don't you drive up the pavement, until you get to the that road right there. I know a back way,. You're never goin g to get throiugh here, like.' I nod, gun the engine, giulp again under its growl, and ram the car up from the tarmac, up over the pouted lip of the pavemtn, nearly stalling. The corsa shudders, but continues and we shudder past the traffic. Beeops sound until Chrissy rises in the back seat and point and tunr sthe pinting first into a swearing finger,a nd then into a mime across his jugulr. I turn lefta s soon as I can, clodding up the edge of sward of coal colouired grass, and screech away up a side road. 'Right,' said Johnny, and I do so. In the back, I hear Chrissy., I had forgoteen how he sounded likekm a lesbian bar maid from a soap opera, all husk and the dead skins of roill ups. 'Who do you support?' he said, to Tony. 'What?' said Tony. Itw as a squeewk. I can't rmemeber him sounding posher. 'Who' do' you' support?' the words are dragged out over the husk of his larynx, sounding, each as neadly as a node of cancer. There was a code to this, I knew, from my Dad, my Uncles. The male morse of sport, al;legiance, power, even. 'I just support whoever's winning,' said YTony. Itw as his standard line, though delivered with none fo the normal twinkle. 'I'm a whore when it comes to football teanms. Domestimes I even change sides halfway through.' I blanch, though I shouldn't care for him, now, not at all. It is the listening to a car crash, the screech, squeall, loosened wheels running down the hill. I can feel Chrssy's satre. Not knife-like; A beheading. Then, he laughs, huk-huk-huks somehow making it over the barren hills of his tonsils. Huk-huk-huk. Johnny isn't laughing but smiles. Secret, that says, I know where the bodis are kept, and what he will do with your's, mate. Huk-huk. Chriissy manages, before th next. 'The problem with whores, mate,' huk. 'Is they end up being screwed in the end.' Tony laughs, quick as he can. Coltish, like a girl giving her virinity away too early, his laughter running away with itself. Chrissy has stopped before he has realised, and before he can. Chrisssy is still staring at him. Tony, I can see in the rear view mirror, lookms away. 'Cooking with gas,;' said Cherissy, Tony ddidn't look at him. He wss till smiling. Tony could tell, the feel of it burnt on his cheek like freshly stiched, scarlet A. Ton was looking out of the window, at the passing, world, down the streets of which could be seen thwe afterimages of fires and, occasionally, the raw shock of an uncontained blaze. Sirens slappe the ngith air senselss, producing a whine in Tony's ears, made an interofation of his brain. Why can't I look at him~? Why do I feel like crying? Doesn't he know I'm a published author? 'They're bunkering.' Johnny's voice, int eh front, was deep and low and easy as his seating position. He was unlimbered, seat hitched back into Tpny's shins. The backseat was asocoilogical study of territory. Chrissy was liemkwise lounging, but sideways, and his joggling feet, as unable to remain still as his fists, the knuckles of which eh cracked relentlessly,a sif trying to crack every bone in his body before moving on to Tony's. They ' the jostling feet- kicked Tony bit by bit. He felt unable to complain. He shifted away. He felt like shit. 'Digging what mate?' said Chissy. Joanne wasn't speaking. She ws all eyes, as she sometimes was aroud her family. Watchign the road seemd to give her sight a safe place to go. 'Not digging. Bunkering. It's when people try to tap off oil. They do it in poor countries, like Nigeria. They're doing it at the petrol stations, but fucking it up, and bang.' 'Jesus, bro, how do you know this shit? Oh, don't tell me. He reads that boring shit guardian, n ot the sport or the star like a cdecent person.' Momentarily, Tony thought he was talking to him, but managed not to tun to look. He began to hum, and tapped dsoemthing the approximated the sound sfrom his tongue o9n the plastic rim below the window. What am I doing? He thought. He hadn't thought for some time about his mother, in her hospital bed. 'Yeah, yeah,' said Johnny. Joanne was laughing. Tony guessed it was safer than talking. He wa ssure he could smell the barrel of the gun. SAcrid, oily, hot. He wiped his sewty upper lip to disguise his gulong, and then did so again. 'No nipple count in hoighty toity guardian, si there. Only tits there are the tits who read it.' 'Ho, ho,' said Johnny. 'Huk, huk,' laughed Chrissy, the sound barely making it over his ayrn. Itw as never reach his eyes, Tony knew. They evaded humour, josling in their sockets as his fingers did on his cracked knuckles. The laughter subside with the drawn out, harsh sound of a pet's final breath.

In spite of the flames, the night air wa sconsensing, its drizzle congealing into heavy rain then, with a scattered sound that forcibly remineded Tony's heart of ther gloch's bullets, it spoured into hailstones. 'Shit,' said Joanne. 'Fuckin shit.' Sewraong like a btrooper, thought Tony, o, more likely, like aganster. Trying to fit in. 'They';ve sent the TA to The Hills. New patients are being turned away, unless they're dead serious. Huk huk. Or dead.' Ohnny turned. From his relaxed position, the snarled twist of his abdomen reminded Tony fo apredator. 'What you on?' asked Johnny. 'Facebook.' 'What did I say abou Facebook?' 'Yeah, yeah. I know, but I've not updated opr nythig. Kepp your knickers on. I've just looked at my wall.' 'They track that.Get off it and in the forums. Find out what the Redc army are up. I want to know if they're in the local TA.' 'Yeah, Danb si, and Will.' 'Get in the forums,' repeated Johnny., turning back. Both his lps anmd his jacket sighed as they relaxed against the rest of him. 'We're nearly at The Hill,' he said, softly. 'I think som,' said Joanne. She had lowered her head and appeared to be trying to stare unbder the windscreen wipes, despite their arc reaching the base of then windshield. Their scrape had become a screech, at the speed they had now reached. 'Yeah, there,' she said. Blue light srefracted through the droplets the broken wipers were failing to erase, like the lights of evil fairies. Staring over his wife's shoulder, the pin point made Tony a Christmas kind of sentimental. Either yat, ir he just wanted to cry. Chrsitmas made him think of his mother's perfume. Thenc,e of her under the white linen, the beat of the heart monitor, the smell of disinfectant, the bacldnes, and the scar from her temple to the lumpiness behind her right ear. She was up there, somewhere, in the edifiasc eof the Hills that loomed into site. Eith it, at its base, he could see army jeeps, and green truck, dark enough to be melted into the night, bar the lights on the grill at its front. There was the luminous jacket,. Here and there, of the poluce, but they were spread, lose as the seeds for the kind of plant that might be seen in Avatar. Most of the figures he could see,a nd there weeren't many of thes, in the soured night, were uniformed in the army-truck green. By the flicker of grey in the general gloom, they were waving away the line of cars before them. An ambulance went by, all lights and sound and the sense of someone else's misfortune. 'Might not,' his voice wsas plugged by mucus. He cleared it with a huk not unlike Chrsisy's and tried again. 'Might not be able to get in tonight,' said Tony. 'He's right,' said Joanne. There was an edge to her voice, a siftness around of her words, perhaps of sympathy blurring them to gether, 'They're going to run us away. There's not way we get in.' Johnny turned again. A slower action, but coiled, ready. There was the working of tonmed muscels theer and none more so than his brain. By the sharpness of his eyes, it ewas ready. Tony could not bear to hold his gaze. 'We have o get in,' he heard Johnny say to his brother. Then he wsd reaching into his jcket. Then he was handing Johnny the gun. The gun. Outside, without the sun, the temperature was goiung down, but this was nothing against tehn dfall within the car. Sound seeedm to derpart, along with the warmth, and with Tony;'s ability to suck ion air. 'Sorry mate,' said Johnny to Tony, who didn't momentarily, realise he wqas talking to hinm, as he was staring at the gun. The single hole at its end seemd dto be an eye which, in its metallic tun, was staring at him. 'I'm not so sorry,' said Chrissy, the rasp of his bvoice nails that caughtTony';s awareness and dragged him back to the moment. Tpny's sight flicked to Chrissy, then away, then back to Chrissst. Away. Back. He couldn' look at him, nor anywhere else. He was caught betwtcta dn between, and, more so, between a haredc palce and the barrel of a laded gun. 'I'm going to shoot you in the leg,' said Chrissy. 'It's your choice where in the leg. If you paly difficult, it will be someplace with a lot of blood. Be a good boy, and roll up your jeans and let me shoot you near the bottom, and you get bth keep the whole thing. ASll of it, what do call. Yeah, all fo the limb.' 'What?' Tony tried to say. He didn't even get to a wha. Without brwathin, speaking had become difficult. 'No,' said Joanne. The wsn't breatjelss,m not like Tony's lungs, but itw asn't far off. 'Beep your horn,' said Johnny. 'No.' 'Beep it!' he shouted, His eyes, however, YTony could; tell with one flick of his own, where not unkind. He was sparing her. Tonmy had always been good at picking up the deails. IUtw as part of bein a writer, he guessed. Apart from this guess, all his mind could offer, detail wise was, I'm about to be shot. His penis offered more, as it had earlier, all of it liquid, and some of it spreading from his boxer shorts, and into his ejans. 'Aw, don't be such a bloody pussym,'; said Chrsiiyt. His nose was wrinkong upm, as thoughn trying ot get a sfar away from the smell of urine as it was able. In fairness, thought Tony, it was my penis. His mind had openede as wide as his bkladder.

He wishes he could do so more slowly. Tony doesn't want to reach home. She's driving the car. A Citreon CX , skinny and pale but for the dirt and looking like, from the outside, a locked-out, starved dog that's waiting for a bell to be rung. On the inside, it sound slike china tea-set on a tray - run at full speed. The sun is beginning to set, brushing the hills on either side of the road red, really slapping it on, in Tony's opinion. Above Snake Pass, the sky was a beauty, a sight the socially exceoted version of perfect, like the faces of the women Tony had never bedded, but, though the cab of the corsa was lit, his wife had pulled down the sun-screen, on her side, and none of the light touched Tony. His wife was speaking, needless to say, 'You think you need to be a child to be a writer, do you? What's that bloody saying of yours?' She doesn't give him a chance to say. ''A flexible mind; a creative mind'.' Her sneer says it better than he could. 'Well,' she says. 'I'd like to see yo create money fro the solicitors out of thin air. Or any bloody manners. You're so arrogant, just because you're off with my mam, you didn't have tp act that way. It's my mam, for Christs's sake.' Tony couldn't help but think, Mum. 'Like a pouting, little kid, the way you talked to ma mam even though you know I hardly get to see her.' Joanne didn't say 'like' at the end of the sentence. Not saying 'like', Tony knew by now, was Geordie for dislike. In one way or another, these days, his wife was always expressing dislike to him. She was continuing, 'I mean you just refused to talk to her for hours and for what, what she stole a sausage of yer plate? Pathetic.' Your Mam gave me a blowjob in the coat-cupboard. He couldn't say it. She says, 'All over your bloody sausage!' Arguments' he thinks' it's always the little things. Instead, he glanced right and away, hoping to see the farm, squatting awkward as he felt between two carriageways, but seeing her outline, in its stead, an arora of darknes, despite the blonde curls of her hair, loose like a perm that had let itself go, as her stomach had let itself out, gone to fat years ago. She was shadowed, her hand swollen on the wheel with all the primacy of the driver. Me woman. Me in control. He grimaced a smile and didn't say anything and gulped and tried not to let the sound of it out of his lips. She always won the arguments. Tony couldn't admit it with any kind of clarity, but she is cleverer than him. He looks left through the window to the passing moor, limp in the seat as any passenger could be. I've been a passenger for too long, he thought. 'Look at that sunset,' Tony said, before he thought of her mother, again, and her curves, and the face he loved, a face like the sunset, a body better. The curves of her face around him, her lips first, then her cheeks, then her round, big, brown eyes, bulging, but smiling at their edges. His wife didn't reply. There was the tightening of her lips, and that of her fingers on the steering wheel. They sounded the same, to him. The linings of the car were rusty grins. He thought with satisfaction of the junkyard. He could almost see the fossils of what had once been them, a shared love, long kisses on a campus bed, any kind of lust. The looked like anemonas, floating before his eyes. He blinked them away. Give in. 'Look,' he said, as had many times before. 'I'm sorry.' Her voice carried the sound of her giving up. 'It's all very well saying your sorry all the time, but you don't even know what your sorry for, do you?' I was right, Tony thought. I even lose when I'm trying to. 'I do,' he said, trying for earnest, as he had at the altar. He looked at her, hoping his blue eyes would carry what his intentions could not. Once she had thought they were pretty. Before, his face had been enough to paper over what she had called his 'fucked up' brain. She stared at the road, more, he thought, than she needed to. But, what did he know, he wasn't the driver. 'I shouldn't have been mean to your mam,' he said, using the Geordie. It was worth a go, like. 'It went too far. I went too far. You find things hard enough with them, with your family, and I've just made things worse.' Joanne looked again. A flick of hard, brown irises, being Stoned, he thought, before, but not in the mellow way. She won't be a Stones soon. 'It would be nice if you actually meant that.' 'I do.' Tony attempts outrage. 'And I'd appreaciate if you didn't second guess how I'm feeling. It's not fair on me, to do that, when I'm just trying to be honest and find some common ground between us.' God, why? Tony wonders sometimes if he's a sociopath. She has suggested the same. His wife's a therapist, worst luck. There's a darkness inside him, he's", "label": 1}
{"text": "One was Chrsissy., The person in the cr infront waved angrily at his rear view mirror. The green men waved. Tony bent and rolled up the jeans on his left leg. His head didn't so much swim as drowned. He was blacking out before it had happened. He wuld find it hard, later, to blame the feint entirely on the bloodloss 'Please, she said. Hew as quite pleased he had managed anything, but, eith a further, 'beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeop' He was tor realise ot hadn't down in any good. 'BANG.' Pain was an express ridingt eh rails of his nervous system, derailing into his brain. His left calf looked slaughtered. Blood was a tumour on hi vision, like that in his mother's braiun. His mind spawned images, hallicnaitions, as she had seen, before they took her to the doctor. An office. S bold man. A smear of mustard omn his whirte coat. What has he been eating? Tony rememberd thinking. He was trying to tell him something about his mother but all he could hear was the thought that it might have been hot dofgs. This, for some reason, had horrified Tony. Tony screamed. Chrissy was opening his mouth.,Shouitng at him, but seemd to be saying, 'Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep.' Beep. Said the machine beside his mither's head. Beep. It said. Beep. Itw as hoispoutal. She as in a hospital. Thay were at a hospital. 'You better go through. Jesus, has he been shot?' 'Yeah mate int eh rioting.' 'Better take him up. A and E on your right, pal.' People were speaking. Teher were words. That's what happened when people were speaking. Right? The wordsc multiplied. Went up and up and ut of control. 'I feel like purple poo pyjamas.' Maybe that's me? Asked YTony, odf himself. He didn't have the wherwital to reply. He didn't have most of his left calf. Something was floating down toward him, too white to be unconsciousness, an angel, he thought, far away, hugh in the skya s the sun should have been. But no, there- it touched his nose- it was close. He didn't feel it. If it were an angel it eas the kind of size that coul dhvae danced on the head of a pin. He didn't have consciouens, he would have trealised had he not blacked out and been thinking,g instead, bye, bye, Mr. yellow sun. Part 2 Funnn Umber whununnnnnnn. These sounds and around them not much else, blank as the fin ger spacing on a page of text. Umbe whununnnn. Pain was in here with hin, Tony was sure, suree in a wway he was of nothing else, including that his name was Tony. Pain was here, and it would make itself known. The big entrance. Knock knock. Who's there? Funnnn Umber whununnnnn . 'Funnnnnnn Umber whunnnnunnnnn,' the man in the bed next to Olly said, not for the first time. Olly turned away, but only his head, and attempting to twust as little as he could of his neck. The shoulder injury, kicked there when he had already been kicked to the curb by looters, forbade craning. His eyeballs bulged, doing what his shoulder muscles did, swelling in the circled bandages of white. It was just as blank outside. It had been snowing for a week and the football season was two weeks from beginning again. Blue moon he thought. There hadn't been a moon since ths un went away. There wouldn't be any football, either, a this rate. That snow must be piling upo, he thought. It's well cold enough to settle. He was surprised by how little he missed football. He couldn't recall the last transfer rumlour he had heard, or at which point following the turning off of the sun tat he had ceased to care. Perhaps, itw as when he had gone out for tinned beans. 'Went out to get some beans, got done by some human beings,' he whispered. It seemed worth saying out loud. He laughed, but silent as the snow, and somewhat heavily. His shoulder jolted pain into his jaw, and he clenched it, feeling his cheek muscles writhing like snakes ina bag. 'How's the arm?' He twisted. Snakes again , he thought. 'It's the shoulder doc',' he said. He hadn't heard him come in. The doctor must have crept to the hospital bed as they did on TV when they were carrying pillows. 'Feels like merde, excuse my French.' The doctor picked up the board at the dnd of the bed. He stared at it. Olly's eyeballs had gronw used to watching ' little else to do in the long night of his recuperation- and he cpouldn't help but notice that the doctor's eyes didn't really focus. They were glazed. Olly remembered that feeling from school. Pretedning to read, trying to see up Lucy's blue 'lin dress. 'Sure,' said the doctor. Now his eyes came to staring at him, Olly couldn't recall seeing this doctor before. He tioghtened, his limbs, his throat, his heart, like a dish cloth being wrung. He felt sweat squeezing out. There was a lot of screaming in this hospital. That was to be expected, Olly jad told himself, time after time, and; go to sleep. Her copuldn't explain why the screaming seedm to be in the alls, or some of the shadows he had seen. I'm on edge, Olly thought, and shrunk furthert into the centre of the bed as the doctor walked up its side. 'Just gonna hve a quick look under the badage. Only at the shoulder.' Olly nodded. He tried to say, 'just don't get fresh and look at my neck,' but his windpipe had constricted until it was difficult to get air through it, much less the width of a word. 'funnn Umber Whunnunnnnn,' said the man in the bed next to Olly. The doctor crand as Olly hadn't, but more up, then sideways, tilted his forehead downward. It loomed, fran eknstein, monstrous. There were shadows on the wall, again, but at least they", "label": 1}
{"text": "didn't look like a witch again. 'Wonder what he's going on about,' said Olly, findinga crack through which to speak. The words were a croak and, perhaps, even less. The doctor didn't seem to be listening. 'Nice tat,' he said. 'Thanks,' said Olly. The skin under the bandage felt as though it wanted to crawl donw under the linen, wrap itself in it, cuddle a teddy bear. Itw asn't healing, but the sensation of the doctor's eye on it. There was too much staring going on for Olly. 'Blue moon?' said the doctor. A coldness had come into his tone that made OLly glance out of the window. He nodded and gilped as the nod pressed his chin into his collar bone, so much the better to conceal his fear. He felt naked, and ten hospital scrubs did little to cover it. 'A blue?' 'Aye,' said Olly. 'You?' A smile crowbarred out across the doctor's lips, revealing teeth that were wonky, broken in by the act of smile, Olly wondered. His mind whirred through images and came back, time and again, to the doctor holdinga crowbar, smiling with his broken-in teetyh. I think too much, he thought. The doctor didn't answer his question, but said, 'I'll be back to,' a pause was put down, a paperweight in the midst of the sentence, purposefully, left to weigh on Olly's chest. '' to check onm you a little later.' The smile had nither gone awaym, nor reachd his eyes. 'Sure doctor'' Olly left apause of his own, staring at the breast of the white coat. Normally, there was a name bade. 'Sure,' said the doctor. He looked down to his own coat. He looked up at Olly. He turned, walking away, not checking on the man who was saying, 'Umberrrrr.' 'Oh change the record, will you?' said Olly, as soonm ass the doctor had ;eft. The man stopped, as body straightening until he was an exclamation mark in the linen, a cotton hiss of surprise replacing his moans. His eyelids fluttered but did not opne, loike those a moth within a cocoon, like he was dreaming, and dreaing hard. Crimping his stomach and clenchng his kjalwines together, Olly raisede his abdomen and swung right, out of the bed. The floor tiles felt cold as gravestones beneath his skin. The chill rode his legs to his crotch. He was withered, he knew, by the ebd rest and the operations. He hadn't liked the look of the doctor. He had, Olly realiused, looked quite a lot like him. And I don't look like no doctor, he thought. He shuffled out to the hallway, and toiled his body around the jamb of the room's door. Strechers and wheeled bed s littlered the edges of the corridor. The hospital was lousy with patients. At the corridors end was the nrses staions and at this, no nurses, but the doctor and a green-jacketed man. Olly caught a glimse of red the colour of a devil's skin, beneath the jacket, and knew he wore a football top. It took another to realise he only saw this, because the man had turned,and was pointing at him. Olly thought it might hv ebeen the old, but he felt loike a shiver passing across the dead, blue skin of the floor tles, as he hurried awauy. Both his heart and his bvreath in his chest weer wfaster than his legs. The two men the doctor whow as not , Olly wws now sure, a doctor, and the other, both sang. He knew ths ong, from away football matches at Old Trafford. It reminded Olly of a week before, of lying aginst the haerdc lips of the curb, being buffeted against it like flotsam in astorm. There's nothing, oh no there's nothing,' they sang. Olly tuedn the corner of th corridor and slid into the toilets. The door cut off the song with a snap of wood finding its jamb. Olly looked left to right. No urinals. He was in the ladies. He entered a cubicle, turned, an with fingers made into fried sauasages by sweat and swelliung fear, turned the latch. The toilet door snapped. 'Oh no, there's nothing we like more,' Olly sharnk against the toilet. He was weing but the patter of it let him know he was missing the bowel. He could smell urea. Sweat and piss, he thought. The door boomed as it was struck, the catch creaked. 'Oh, no,' they were in full flow. HGearty as a miners choir, the toilets revoundeing with bounce of kicked plastic and merry words. 'there's nothing we ' like' more'top do'' The door shattered back. Olly shied, the inside of his knees knocking togther luike clonked heads as the backs of them his the toilet rim, and he plunged back into the piorcelianb. The lids were up, and slapped aginst his spine, dragging pain like the lengtnof a piano played, from the top fo his headf, to his ankles. By the smiles on both men's faces, that was the elast of the apin he would ace. He covered his heads, as the kicked came in, like rain heavy enough o be sideways, upwards, every which way. Every part of him became pain and he screamed as hard as h could, and for as long, but he no one came and he still heard, 'than kicking a blue, kicking a blue, kicking a blue Oh there's nothing n wer like more to do, Than kicking a a blue' ' tan kicking a blue'' ' than kicking a blue'' Funnnnummm Umbbbbbeerrr Whunnumm, it went, the sounds he heard, in a whine. Then in came the pain, a sun of its own in th edark of his unconscious mind, black as the bullet hole in hios bone. Then went the pain and the sounds, Funnunnnnmmm Ummmmmmmm' Fading out, or dwindling into his body, Tony could not tell. Must be the drugs, he thought, or rememnbered thinking, the thought coming back to him in", "label": 1}
{"text": "an echo. Must be. He opened his eyes without realising, for some time that he had done so. The room was a blur, the details of which were paletted colours, spreads inherently into each other, a Matisse, a Picasso. The lines defined somewhat and, in the midst of them, floating above his hospital linen, white beliedm, was a caqt. The echo came back, disturbed by whatever surface it had touched, Must be the drugs. The cat that floated above his linen-embalmed belly was not purring, but appeared, to his ears, to tutt, then said, with a lisp hanging off the end of each word like a ruff on a babe prince, 'Arvand's realm is rootless, if you knows what I means.' 'Muist be the drugs,' Tony tried to say, but birthing speech from thought seemd as probable as a cat hovering the middle of ahospital room. As implausible as the Cheshitre cat. It wasn't grinning, it's doing the opposite, a frown of downturned lip and whiskers as if they couldn't be bothered to feel out the world. What would be the point, said its baleful eyes, an oddumber in colour, with irregular-line pupils the shape of trapped mosquittos,? The flatness of its skull only added to the impression of depression. It looked to Tony like a pancake that had been flipped on the floor. The Yorshire Cat. Tony had been there many times, and knew the look. It reminded him of his in-laws. 'Arvand's realm,' it repeated. '' is rootless, if you knows what I means.' With this it rose. Not with the shake and stretch of the domestioc feline, but allowing its spine and fur to remain flat. It barely lifted its tail as it pissed on the air above Tony's bed. All Tpny could do was stiffen as the droplets hung, yellowed willo-the-wisps, illuminating nothing but the disgusting nature of animals, to Tony, then, without so much as a bye-your-leave, the urine fell on his linen, and the cat left, padding out across the air. Like a boared ina wreck, he heard himself creaking, part of his went under, summeregd in bilged, rimy bitterness, and he cracked as he twicted out of the hospital bed. His right foot, at the ankle, on ths shin, felt itself crwbarred to the side, not with the wound of the bullet, but from a desire ' an image in his mind- of kicking the cat in the belly, naybe the ribs. He didn't notice that the bullet hole was gone and strode after the cat, out of the room, left away from the toilets and towards the lift at the nuirses' station. Somehow it had made it. Somehow it had reached the information button above the intercom to the lifts' left. Somehow pressing this was closing rthe door. How? Despite his injury because it had gone and left him whole, Tony could run, and did so, fi ngers unpeeling the air, claws all, as they reached toward the dwindling gap between the doors. The cat watched him with those eyes that couldn't give a shit and might wekll do that next time, instead of pissing. The doors closed. That was close, his mind offerd. He looked up at the pining of the floors. Seven, six, five, four three two one, then, ping, none of the numbers was lit, only the 'I'. Ping. Tony collapsed. The pain bit again, first his back then returned fully, with all of the familiarity of old contempt, and with it, 'Funummm Ummmmbverr Whunnnnunnnnn'.' Why am I sitting here, reading this? I think. Outside, thich, soft snowflakes moths flap against the pane, driven by a breeze rthat is threatening to become a gale. Light falls like value chicken soup from the bulbs overhead, long in their ceiling tile boxes, lonmg in their life, They've been going out, from time to time. The snowflakes were no loner angels biut bloated an dhairy and the front cover of Silence of the Lambs springs into my mind, A dead-blue woman, with a moth in hger throat. I gulp and continue readinmg. It is sielent outside, bar te rattling fo wind thorugh the struts of the building, and my voice was foregrounded. In places, I notice, like a dot-to-dot children's book but backwards, the progress of the white, falling flakes seems to erase some of the lights of the cityu, twinkling out there, om the hospital's West side. The snow didn't seem to be making every thing beautiful shrouding the ugkly, but erasing it, countless rubbers casually brushing out humanity. Now you see us. The book I am reading from is his, the man in the bed before me, his eyelids doing the jig of dreaming. The ma who usedc to be mine. The boomk is about me, barely disguised, my childhood,d my family. Thank God it didn't sell well. It is why we are braking apart. What kind of man takes the secerstI have told them, turns them inside out lie a broken umbrella, then opens them out again, in the spread-eagled pages of a book. What kind of man? A writer, it is. A whore, he is. It's just that he siold me out, not him. I am redaing this, '[Aimme strangulation]' For each Chris I read Mickey, for each Mum, I read my mother. All fo the other salient details remained the same, and he, Topny, thoughtw e could remain together. '[]' I lean forward, as I finish the scven, and though I say, 'You bastard.

It's about self belief, I suppose, but I have a well tuned bull shit detector, my childhood was good for this, at least, and I have long since stopped trusting clocks. Fucking, cocking clocks. The birds had attempted ot go home, to fly south, some tiem ago. It may have been a week, but when a wek hads days it could call it own, and not one long unfathomable night. They had taken flight as one. I had, at the time, shivered as though my backa dn nape and shoulders qwere made of feathers caught in tehrti mass updraught, and recalled pictures of swallows massing, so much so they were the sky and the blue or red sunset the dots in their world. Then, the sound of the flying hadn't left, and I realised they weer simply going rund and round' and round. I uessed it was th lack of sun, but the sound of their gyre, like Yeat's, neither widening, not coming to a definitive, second end, orbited until by teetn ground in their own circles, and the cogs pf my thoughts unsprung,a nd wheeled off on their own. I had come here, then, and collapsed against the side of soon to be ex husband, and cried tin ashaking silence against his lineen and listened ot the birds dropping, efatugiued, ferom the sky oen by one, their softening thuds as the snow fell, their increased falls as the snow increased,w iegjuing on their shoudlerrs as the sound of the breaking bone asnd wings did on my mind. Now, silence. If birds are defijned by their ability, even in short, chicken hops, to taker to wing, there were none left that I could see or ehar. The corpses far below the window, gently shrpiuded by snow as though could barely cover them with fingers frozen bu shanme, didn't ount. They would never fly again. Me and the corspses of pigeons, I think, all ttapped here. I put his book down on the bedside table. There aren't flowers, but on the front cover si a Laburnum petal, sickly yellow as his name ' Tony Stones, that sluiced light as the book came to a rest. A scene a day, just like our marriage, these last few months. It haqdn't., on some level, come as asurprise to find he would sacrifice their arraige for his writing. It had coenm as a shock to see how low he would go. 'Little shit,' I say, and hoep he can hear me, but shake my head and a tear slips out like atraitor from a castle's hidden pogress. 'Fuckin'' I can't go on. He never liked my swearing, but it isn't that. He has wet himself. '' shit.' I manage, coming back into the sentence as a knockout does to consciousness. He is rising in his bed. His shoulders and head first, into the pose of a paraplegic, then, swinging, sideys, his feet roll between the linen,a nd to the hard, cooling floor. They smack their, felled as logs. I imagine the calf. A meal of broken flesh beneath banaging, and a rupture. Was that a tear I heard. My eyes are dry, wrinkoing into themselves like salted slugs. It was arip, I'm sure of it. 'Don't,' I say, as he rises again, this time nothijn g like a paraplegic, unless one, who., by some m,iracel, ahad heale.d Now the tear is more perdsuaisive, an unhotchign of sound a flesh, a zipper in the reality fo the room.

He is saying, 'Come back here you little moggy.' H eis leavin g blood behind himand I think again of slug.s and their silevred trails. The blood looks metallic in the lioght, which itselfm lookms crass,m cheap as blended bargain whiskey. He has gone and I follow, out into the corridor. At the nurses station is the skinny one whi keeps failing to change his ssaline bag. The blacjk nurse, I cannot see. I watch as my husband walks, entirely straight when he shoulde have been bent, crippled, dragging his right foot. The liuft, beside the station at the end of the corridor, pings, but the door doesn't opne. Not yet at least. 'Nurse!' I say the sowrd a cork in my throat. I gulp, an try again. 'Nurse!'

The bed next to him is empty, and unmade, though the cirridors below, I know, are over spilling. Trypical hospital inefficiency, I think,m and am about to turn, to follow my husabd, when the lift door, with a ping, open. Inside, a cat sits. Its face seems to have an issue with teality, one which as set it not so much ina frown as in despair. The feline opens its pi9nk paw and bone-white teeth and hacked-hacked-hacked then vomited ont eh lift floor.All the while, he watches me. He seems to be saying, though spepch would be impossibvle through such a trail of vomit, and, for that matter, for a cat; you make me sick. The lift doors close and the floor indicator above them begings to flick through a semi circle of numbers. Eventually, the cat, accoridn got these, travels throught the 'b' and the numbers flick out, leaving only the 'i' lit. 'King Candy,' says the grill above it. I lean forward ina spurt as much as Tony's blood, feeling red and hot, abruptly. 'Why don't you just try being professional, eh?' I say. 'Have you got Kinbg candy?' says the intercom. 'Can I have you?' 'Sick little shit,' I say, but am unsurprised, and ris,e jabbing the 'I' off. It doesn't do so. I turn away fronmthe sound of it's static which has begun to resemble, discomfortingly, the breathing of a mchine. The lift, perhaps. I walk back down the corridor to Tony's room. ]# The linen at his crotch was wet. In part this was sweat, and was repeated in drips and daubs across his back and where the cloth met his l;eft calf. On the right, pf course, the bandage, which had been reapplied since his somnabuilism, sealed in the sweating. The nurses hadn't bothered changing the rest of him, his garments, the line, ditto the bin, or the bed next to hin, the blankets of which were lumped as though the ghost of whatever it's previous owner had been. In the the sour bubbles of indigdesgation from dr4eams too long, too long spent induced by drugs into sleep, memories of him came back to tony. Th shaven head. The 'alright ate' drawn out like the needle with which they had taken his blool,d while the could till be bothered. The farting noises, and stenches. Maybe he's still there, under the cover. Not so much as a ripple of breathing. Dead, then, but I can't smell him, so, no, he thinks. Unless his own stench, somewhere in between the chlorine of the moped corridor and floor, his sweat, his urine, an dthe odour of incipient disease tahtw as the speciality of wards. Tony wanted the linen, not to replace his onw; he could live with the smell of him, shaming as it was. It was the cold he couldn't bear, which seeped into him as he did into the covers. The snow was a thock yellow piss- line at the base of the window, beyond which everything was dying, lit by the long-life-lights of the hiospital which seemd, themselves, diseased, close to passing away, and went out regularly. They left an instant of shock, of black, when there was nothing left, now the sun wasn't coming back, then red lights could be seen, in halo's, auras of bulbs, ghosts of where the emergency llighting flickered, by the door, and out into the corridors, loike that along the passengerways on pkanes. Those had gone out, once, too and in the dark, Tony had his first thoughts of going with them. God hd turnded out the light on his way out. the snow flakes, for now, had ceased, leaving a crisp blackness like chicken skin left too long on the barbecue. The corportate blocks that could be seen West o the Hills, the Co-op, the Srndale the Hilton, had been going out, lso, one by one. ASfter God, it seemd, CEO's followd. The multinationals were leaving the building. Tony did not take this to be a good sign for those that were left behind He shivered, skin craqwling and rubbing his flesh in palm sized chunks, as though trying to warm itself. The btectonic lates of Tony coming apart. He sweated into his eys, and down from their gritted corners as though tears, but didn't dare raise his hands from the cloth. It would be colder if he did. The air would get into the bubble of fart and urea he had crafted in the bed, if he did. He wife walked in, looking like she was returning to a childhood bedroom. She blinked, and came back to her self, and had the expression of recalkling that he was no longer her own. She said, 'Jesus, you stink.' And crinkled her cheeks and forehead down until they met her nose, which spiekd. His teeth writhed against each other. Dhe could still cut im. 'Like I can do anything about it.' 'Christ,' she said, and grasped the sheets fromt h bed beside him in one long reach as loping as her legs. The bed was empty, like magic trick. 'Put this over it, at elats.' 'I can't move,' he said, secretly grateful for the heat he could already feel embalomng him. 'If you remember.' 'Yeah,' she stared ut at the window and, seeming to see nothing in it but herself, she quikly looked at the bin. Sh hated her reflection. Tony guessed it rememnided her of what she'd been through. 'Haven't those bloody nurses been in?' This was as much as a softening of tone as he could expect, or had, for some years. The hardening towards other., the twisting of the spike into other's flesh. He wass as grateful, momentarily,m as he had been of the blanket. Her lack of ire warmed him. 'Nope,' he said.", "label": 1}
{"text": "'I'll talk to them,' she said. He softened. It was a blow to recall how kind she could be. A rmenider of what he had lost,. What he would lsoe. He pressed his advantage. 'Doin't worry abpout it. They won't do anything.' She half-smiled, not looking at him, his eyes gesturing, in their gazer, as though she might. 'You know what I could do with.' He said. ;'Been staring at these walls, waiting fro the power to go out. Bored stiff,a nd it's not just the cold..' 'Yeah,' she evn looked at hinm. 'It's freezing isn;'t it?' 'Gods, yeah.' He smiled so she might catch it. 'But you know me, obsessively writing, and I'm really missing it' He words stopped, a caravan trail cut of by the idnians, the remander of the sentence circling up in his mouth. He couldn't missing the freezing of her exptression, the calcification of years odf pressire. Her wjite, icy skin hardened until it seemed it might be a diamond. It had the loom of soemthign that could cut. 'You what?' Now, she was staring at him. He felt [words used for the aphixing of insects/butterflies]. 'After everything you've done to me, everything you've fucking taken from me, you want me to get you a bloody pen and paper. So ou can do more fucking damage?' 'A pen would be enough,' he was squirming, caught on the pins of her vision, her clawed hands hovering as if those of the Enperor. 'Why? What for? Why do you thiunk writing is' is'' she had lost the owtrds, or they wre hiding from her. Ton had sunk into his sheets. 'Who's going to buy a book now, eh? The world is pover and all you can thinking about is your la-di-da precious fucking writing.' 'I'm'' he almost said a writer, but his lips thought better than his brain, and said, 'sorry.' She shook her head, an avction some thwre between regretful andf hateful. She walked out, head hardly turned to the door before her legs and snapped through it. He heard her receding, along with the feel of his ehart in his chest cavity, the thrashing of arteries calming. She returned, abruptly, and they flailed, slapping his wrists full, fo blood. For a moment, as eh strode to the bed, he though he might strijken him and glimpsed what women feel like, at the hands of some one bigger and stronger, cowering into the bed. Instead, she palmed a pen down into the linen beside his shoulder, hissing, 'Fuck you, and fuck your writing.' Tony stared at it, pijtn closed to his eye, the pen as red as an incorerect mark in a school book. He felt sahme at douing something wrong, yet again. He looked up and she was gone, which was no surprise, given her rage and her size, he could barely miss his wife's footsteps, as she paced away. Additionall,ly, she had slammed the door. With fingers shaking between adrenaline and after effects of surgery, Tony took up the pen, turned to the book beside his bed, opened up the fronmt cover and, on the frontiscape, wriote 'bitch'. After thias, eh left what may be imaginede to be a line, and began to write out everything that occurred to him, since he had sat in the passenger seat on the way back from hismotehr in law, on Snake Pass. He didn't let the flash back go to before this. He didn't mention the blow job she had given hbim, her curved body, the line of her curved bottom and wide hips continuing around her bossom and finishing only wher her lips met his penis. He didn't mention that she smield around him as he came. I don't recall how I came to be here, befoe my mother in law, the decisions made along the way, the left and right and take the stairs and, yes, vicar, I do. I do. Vapur rises before my eyes, thick plumes frokm, wartning fires and it is awhile bfeor I realise it comes from my lips. Beyond them my teet ache as though highly struing, joists holding together but barely, as if my face is affected by the winds I can her scrabbling about outside, though we are dep inside The Hillls its secret, chocolateyt centre. It is dark in here, lights down low, b;lips of green like radar falres from the heart monitoirs beside the three beds, next to on eof which I stand and shake and wish something would blow me done, well blow me down. 'What did you do to him,' I say. 'You really fucked him up, didn't you?' The words are whispers but long, sdrawn out, and I imagine the blades of them piercing her insensible skin, her closed lids. I lean forward pinning them in. DShe miughta swell be the foll of who she is. 'Thought Larkin was giving ypou advice did you?' Not even a extra blip, from the monitors. 'I know you didn't touch him up, so how did he end up like this. Maybe you should have hit him. Hit him like I was hit. He looks all nice with his big blues and charming s,kile, oh, such a charming man, but he's a monster. You created a fucking monster.' I kneel beside her pillow, all the best o dribble this into her ear. I think of Hamlet, or more, Hamlet senior. 'All' he' cares ' about ' is' writing. My mother in law siots up in her bed and scream. Momentraily I think I am imaginging this. She grips the side of her head and jerks it as though she has listened to something that she cannot shake out.

I can see something red, like faetakl sac, stretched over fault lines that earthquake down her head. Her fingers splay but there is not enough of them to keep it in. I don't liook at the other beds, but I know the same is happening, to the two others. Her skull mis trying to birth her brains. She loks like an alien, from the X files, grey because of the dark, immense-skulled, because, and I cannot shake this thouht' she' is'not '. Right' in' the ' head. I scream, also, or think I do. It is difficult to tell amid the clamour. There are footsdteps in the corridor. A nurse, I recall, the beef joint is up here, I saw her on the way in. The NHS staff are steched thin these days, or particularly, on his long night, and she can stand more stretching than most. She stumble sin the dark, and in the red of the emergency lighting, and im, I guess, her terror. My throat is sore, rubbed hoarse by the air I retch, but I'm pretty sure not a sound is coming out. Talkjin g of sounds, despite the screaming, I can hear slithering. I manage to look. I would feel proud of this if there were any room for any6thign other than terror. My knees are rooted to the floortiles, planted boughs, I think. My lefgs are nbloody tree trunsk, Tony has said. Bastard. I can turn my head, and have. There is a black spot on the wall, draker than the rest of the shadows, like a hole in the xrays of all the brains in the beds of this room. It is sending out tentacle,s secondary sites on the move, searching, searching, for,' there is is. A scream higher pitched than even the girl with the teddy bar that she is choking in her distress. (how are theyall still screaming. Why have there lungs not given out as my mind has.) The screech, I think, of a witch, cold, unending,m inhuman, pointed at the end like cold nipples on acold tit. The whole world is csreaming, but the with ' and I see er, a silhgoette on a broom screeching across the hospital wall as though it is a starless night ' is not of this world. Of this, as much as I have a grip on anything apart from my nails into my thighs, trying to wrench them into motion, I am sure. Yet, across the wall.,,s she flees,a nd the tentecales of the shadow chase her./ They cjhase also the dimensions of this world. The wall bending, bowing, across th high spot of the shadow. There, as at the cracking points of my mother-in-law's headf, I can something edda dn that is enough for me. Red means GO. I don't need the way they glisten, like the shimmering tumours on packs of cigarretets, so glossy thy could well be Cosmo specials, and I'm up. Now, I find my voice, but find that I am mewling, my lips shaking until the mew becomes a gibber. I have never gibbered before. I mak the door, and hoit the corridor as I slam into the black nurse. Her cheeks wrench back as I stumble away, her teeth an instinctive clench n the dark , and made vampiric by the lights at ankle level. 'What's the Hell's goping on?' Her head is tilted backward as she stares at me. Her hair is high and shining and looks lik it wants to jump off the back of her ehad. It will;, I think, if she looks in that room. She shivers as the silhoutee of the witch passes her. She turns, as the tentecale of shaow that follows the silhoutet, slides around the jamb of the door, and into the corridor. 'Run,' I say., according to my tongue. To my ears it sunds like 'um.' The movement of the tentacles toward the n urse is a soun d loike a sniff. I reckon that is just what moving between worlds soiundslike, and feel like slapping myself. I don't sed where it makes contact with the nurse, but see her face as it does so. Her cheeks seem to attain movement the rest of her face can't make. Her mouth is locked in an expression somewhere between terror and horror and listening to something that cn' quite be heard, but is there nonetheless. A soun on the tip of the ear. I guess it is entering her, because there is the noise of liquid patterin g to the floor. Not much. I hguess her uniform, her tights have soaked most of it. There is a smell, three parts blood, one prt faeces, and she is moving away from me, toward the wall. She reaches ou a hands. She has fin gernails painted red, the thumb nail painted green. I can't brwarhe, let alone reach out to her. What if the wall hears me? I feel, m omentarily, like Tony. She is drawn into the wall. There is liquid glistening on her cheeks and I don't think it is blood. The paints parts around etgr, and closes. The flakes of its uprturned edges sound loike lips, sucking delicately. She is gone. The lights come on. Goodbye roast beef, I think, my mind having no decorum to speak of. Plenty of eating there.

Dr Amin saw the shooting before it happened, in a way that he hadn't the sun going out, or his wife's suicide. He wasn't [sychci, his mindhaving no powers more unusual than being aworld leader in oncology, but his daughter's did. Yet, he couldn't bear doing anthing other than extending her life when he shouldn't, an dpressing her favourite teddy into her arms, andletting her take away the sun. Anubody who lost a daughter, he bthought,w atching the two men at the edge of A and E, one of which he knew carried a gun, any grieving father knew how dark the wolrd became whentheir only daughter fading out of it. His lived, but she had taken the sun with her. For Dr Amin, it was six of one and half a dozen of the other. He was haunted by the ghost of his opwn guilt, his shame hanging off him like soaked clothes ' it was [particularly heavy on the worsts and heels, and he walked with a s;ouch that he knew the nurses' attributed to faitigue. The nu8srse wre stupid, in his opinion, and not because ethy lacked his medical degree, but beceuase- couldn't they see what he'd done. Wasn't it written over him. Weren't the shadows around his eyes, the bags, exactly enough alike the hole where the sun should have been to tell it had been him. He, was sacrificed a sun for a daughter? Idiots. The two men were watching another. A man that must have weighed their combjedn weight, he used to play rugby league, he had said as soon and as often as possible, for Helen, Dr Amin thought, maybe. He didn't care. The man, despite his height and breath and lack of hair was as bad as dead. There would be nothing good about it, reckoned the doctor, and esp[ciellay not for the walls of the A and E. He had seen these two go about their business, this week, at the hospital. Dr Amin mind wa s aswmap the dead he had seen sunk down into, their eyes lit liekt hose in that film his daughyrter, Sabah had liked ot watch, Retun f the Thing, or something, e couldn't recall throiugh the miasma and stench of his thoughts. Memoirs of those that had died were flies, eating at his skin, it itched, as thoughn they had impregnated hom all over with shame, hot rash, quick to claim him. He ws responsible, after all. His wife had told him. She had understood, at every point, medical degree or not. It ad taken some time to convince that the Piggy Brin surgery contained not a hint of pig, and she wouldn't listen, either, after he had told why he though the light of the world had gone out. That evening 'wasn't it always eveing ' he had found, hanging int eh cupboard. He had opened it, for a shirt, for his shift,a nd had gone in anyway. Why not? What was the point of not doing so? If anybody deserved to see the sdead and near dead, and everyone else who would die, anyway, as humanity inevitably dwindled ,wasn't it him. The good doctor Amin? His family had been so proud of him, until his daugther got brain canvcer, and his wife a noose and a stool. The rugby player had refused to join the men's Red Army. Red Army Red Army Red Army, he had heard the singing. Each time he heard it, it jad grown louder, filled more rooms. The Red Armyw as srpreadiong like the feel of the rash on his skin. The rugby player had refused. Football, Dr Amin had herad hinm say, wssn't his game. Wrong shaped ball. Played by pansies. The rugby player was the kind of man who knew his own mind. He wouldn't ;ater, when it was collected in places on the orange of the piant fo the A and E wall. To the untrained, it would appear to be soup, let alone to the brain dead. The lights went out and in the deeper dark (it reminded Dr Amin of an open rectum, but then he had exzaimed enough pritstrate glands iot to recognise the way his own opened with fear, every time the lughst went out) there was a flash. Light returned, momementraily, ina way that hadn;'t been seen for some time, however long it had been since that dusk. It was difficult to count, without days.

The red of emergbency lights clicked on, soenwhere, thought Dr Amin around the level of the Achilles heel, and his blood was slick blackness oiling gthe walls. Thick oil pint, though, in palces, a GCSE art project, improperly mixed. Gloopy. The nurses were screaming, and that didn't help the patients. Keep calm and carry on dying, thought Dr Amin. Don;'t waste your breathe, it's also a wastew of heat. All the plugs in the A and E were attached to electric heayters and they glowed like a new level fo hell. The cold one. He heard the footsteps of the men, blending with each, the noise of one chasing the sound of the other's blending, like a dance omn the run. 'Red Army' a voice shouted. 'Help him doctor,#' a nurse shouted. 'There's really no point,' said Dr Amin. 'Help him,' shouted a patient, possibly the rugby players' girlfriend. In the dark her tall prettiness was reptilian, the thrashing of her fakse eyelashes like spiders drwoning in a bath. The tears would be coming, and would not be unseen, whene the back up popwer supply fired the hospital. It had been doing so too muych, for too long. The firesw oulnd't burn for ever. 'There';s really no point,' said Dr Amin./ A nurse was grasping him, up against his face her breath was heavy with cigarettes and a cloying taste, as though she had been eating all the deatn she had seen. It kicked what felt like an organ inside Dr Amin, one ddiseased and bloated an d tender. He wondered if it was his kloathing. 'There's no point,' he shouted and the swll of his voice pushed her back, her fin gers nails scrapong of his white coated arms as if they had been all that had kept her pinioemnd to a cliff's edge, and it carried on outward, prapitic burst boiling with his rage. The lights came back on. The patient lay on the bed, what was left of head lying above his shoulders, patently dead. His brains didn't have the good crharce to skulk way, but hung there in the light like a pervert caught in their act, red handed, exposed. Dr Amin walkeds away. To the writer in Tony, the turning of nature, like a worm that had swallowed them all, from light to enl3ess night, waas not a surprise. He could comepete, or felt he could, with any other writer, he hgad game, he had thought, at least until his sales figures had come in, and the lack of quotes from any reputable news source, with any but nature. Nature would arrive before his eyes, through the window of a a caf', or the jagged pill of aconversation overheard on a bus, and he knew he couldn't compete not with athast. Itw as so real. He wriote now, a standard apolyapse novel set in a world where the Russians tthreatened to turn off the pipeline to the west, where the Brotsh were said to be invading Iceland, for the thermal springs, you knbow, with the way the internet loading signils went round and round to no avail, just, he thought,, like the clocks, and always ended up on This page cannot be loaded, as the clocks always ended up ionb It's nighttime, obviously. He got the details, but the sum of it all, the coldm the fear, the wind outside and the snow shaking the building until he felt he wass in a world that was an upturned snow globe ' the metap[hor for that, the simile to describe what was happening to hum, he couldn;'t grasp. Nature had got him, the writer, as much, it seemed, as it woiuld get all of them, humanity, and sooner not later. He had tried not think that standard question of the dqwindling out ' why, btu hd ended up with ' why not, what would matter if he did, or didn't. Why? He thought. The outside moaned with wind, as if the question disturbed the air, asf it had better things to do with its time, like freeze. Like me, Tony adds, and tries to write and wishes he could have drink. Instread, he plows on, throught eh soun d flurries against the window, and thunder booming like the knock knock of God, on the building. 'Like the knock knock of God,' he wrote, unable to come up with nythgn superior, 'and we tighten in our bed, wishing gnat's arses of ourselves, and ask , who's theer. I can hear it.

His wife often talks about the Inner Child, and Tony wonders if that is it - the body of a Little Me stinking up his psyche. Clouds drift across the sun's dazzling pate, as though its thought bubbles. Another white Citreon CX goes by, several shades whiter than their own; a ghost of them. Its passenger side, though, is unwound, a dog's head fluttering, gums and hair and skin, and penent-tongued. We should clean our car, Tony thinks. 'Look, okay, I'm sorry,' she said. She sighed. He could measure of their marriage by the sound of his wife's sighs. As with the rings in a tree, they came more regularly. 'Maybe next time, you could just think about why you're doing it.' Her head tilted, eyes still on the dead-skin-grey tarmac. It was pocked. They'd be re-laying soon, he guessed. 'Look, they can be difficult, my family, and maybe you felt under pressure and felt you had to act the big shot writer. But next time, just tell me when you need a break, yeah?' Tony smiled, the grin spreading across his cheeks and into his limbs, through his stomach. Losing was worth this relief. Her sigh, however, was back. 'It would be nice if you had just a little self awareness.' A year ago her tone would have softened, now, become encouraging. But there had been too much water under this particular bridge; the support had washed away. She adds, 'Yeah?' He stares down into the footwell. The sun's getting in his eys, and he's finding it difficult to swallow. 'Yeah?' He tries the gulping again, but can't. 'Yes,' Tony says. ' 'I'll start a journal, like you said, and I promise I'll try'' I'm unhappy - the thought is unsummoned - and I'll never be happy with you. 'Don't try,' she says. 'Do. You're setting yourself up for failure, again. I could do without another one of your failures.' Loser. 'I don't see anything wrong with trying,' he says. 'Some of us aren't perfect, all knowing counsellors, you know.' He forces the word 'counsellor' at her. She insists on 'therapist'. Her head cocks. She nods at an angle, as though to herself. Tony's voice becomes high pitched, as he shouts. 'We can't all be bloody perfect like you, can we?' The words echo back to him along with the thought- and not for the first time- we do it to ourselves. It's a line from a Radiohead song, though he can't recall the title. It isn't Creep, though it should be. She doesn't reply. Instead, 'Get in the right lane, will you? Jesus.' Then, 'I never wanted you to be perfect. Just to be decent. To be someone I could trust.' Red lights ahead. Car crash, he thinks. It's not. She beeps the horn. He says, as she does so, 'You can trust me.' Tony says it softly, and, momentarily, hopes she hasn't heard him. 'Trust you. Yeah,' she laughs. 'Trust you to stab me in the back, and what for , to put me in that book which sold how manhy, how many copies was your integrioty worth, eh, three hundred? To write about hitting me and pretend you're writing about some old security guard. You're sick, you know that. I should have called the police. F--k you.' The swear word wasn't the beep of passing motorists, but whine, like that after a hard slap. He lost her a little each time she did it, the sound of what she said. As with a slap, his face reddened. Tony had talked to her about hswearing before. In reply, she had called him a stuck up southern a-------e. That he should know the difference between sweaing about something, and swearing at someone. 'I told you years agoi, didn't I, you're writing isn't worth it, all that effot,. You're not all that,' she glanced at Tony an dher lips twisted on that side, in his direction. 'You're okay, but your writing's nothing to write home about.' 'Stop it.' He said. 'Yeah,' her tone was light, but her words weren't, they were adroitly stamping. 'you should have, but you didn't did you? Happy to steal my life, my secersts and tell them to the world, for your f----g special s---t of a novel. And when were you planning ot tell me, eh? Whe nyou'd won the booker f-----g prize?' She laughed. 'Stop.' I said. 'And what? Let you out? Youw ant to walk? You're lucky I've given you a lift, I could do with spending as little tgime with you as possible, to be frank.' 'Stop.' He was fgin ding it hard to find any other words in my mind. My fingers clutched at air and found my palms and they were sweating. 'Fine,' she said, and swereved left without indicating to the hard shoulder. The traffic about them became a blur of beeping. Joanne raised her middle finger to the pasing cars. 'Run awau like you've always done you coward. You're happy to write 'The Triuth' areenb't you just, you just can't face up yto it can you?' Myt finger slippd around th car lock before realising she would driuve away. Hitch hike managed to snake into my thoughts and I vrealised I couldn't. 'Go on, get the f--k out.' Whine. 'Stop swearing at me.' She laughjed. 'And what the f--k are you going to do about it?' Car crash, I thought once more. 'Stop swearing at me.' 'Oh you southern, pathertic prat.' For some reason, it is the last word that does for Tony, and not one of the ones which whine. 'Her her her,' she says, next. 31 [degrees Celsius] Thirty seconds before the sun went out, I sat beside him in the car.

A lick of red shoes together. Hecould jhave seen the cat raise its head and stare at him and an exptressionb come ovcer its lips that could almost be described as grinning and certainly could be descvbired as 'painful'. Dr Amin's gait jolted with an especial spasm of his being. He needed the toilet, he realised., had done for awhile, but had forgotten this, in the lift. This si no time for pissing around, he thoguth., and wpould have grinned, as haqd the cat, but he had never been one for puns. Now, it was time to take his daughter from the oncology ward, and lock her ina cupboard. He stood over her. Thatw as the inaccuracy of his stride, at once like tahtn of a giant among men (head of his field, wprld oncology expert, lured here by anew hospital, his own wing, a free hand in research) then hobbled, less than a goblin (murderer of a dead wife, killer of a innocent child, ender of the light If he listended carefully, he could hear all this sid in the accent of Russel Crowe. ). He lokomked down at his daughter, wiping a hand over his face. It havered over the stringy bumps on his cheeks and upper lip. He realised he was unmshaven. In the low light of the ward, his daughter was the spit of his wife. There had been that, as wel as the faeces and urine, let loose by her corpse, as it swung. A chip off the old block, his mind tried, in the place of the spittle, trying to forget the way it had it's own smell, as he held his face to hers, after he had cut her down, a little like mackerel, the faintest hint of garlic. (her shit hadn't smelt like this.) A chip off the old block but for the wedge of cancer in her head. The aame nose. The sma eeye,s though they were bnow closed. Not the same pitiarity gland. Watching her, he stiled. He saw litrle of himself in the child, like staring into apoolm without reflecyion, in the centre of a shawoed wood. He put too staves of arms beneath her and lifted Sbah and her teddy Winnie, from the linen. He turned and her platcy gown flapped aginst his arms like sloughed off dead skin. He hadn't felt the cold for sometime, but her skin felt chioll to him. He thought he spotted putplre dots in the dusky alcoves at the conmers of the rooms, like wilo the wisps trapped and searching likem fleis for a away out. He pulled the tripod on which pylopmned her drips and thw wires to her monitors with the had that held her head, his searing finger downward curld around its metal stenm. Beneath it, one of the wheels squekwed like a mouse that had recently lost its mind. He walked throught he door, dowmn the corridor and to his office, closing its door behind him with a a thin click, like the sound his teeth used to make one set against the other, when he usedc to notice the temperature. As a child, the age of the daughter he carried, he used rto the think his stuidy would be magonhy, like those of the English in the miovies, with a thick red cushioned chair, like a rolled up dung beetle, and a desk so big he could have saile to Sri Lanka on it. Instead, it was clean, as disinfected as a corpse, faetol in the centre fo the hospital. It did have a lockable cupboard with its own ventilation and air conditioning, deep and filled with fiels, and this he needed. He had a long way to go, he thought, at least it must be a long way, musn't it, if it wasn't, the distance, inits tininess, was mind boggling. The Other Place siply couldn't be near. He set his daughter as comfortably as he cpould in the corner fo the cupboard, her legs like disconnccted wiring crooked out from her abdomen. He straingethenmed and coveredc them. He didn't need to sert her teddy back against her. Somegow she held onto Winnie, as tight as she was failing to do with her life. The teddyw as yellow but apart from in tbhis shared nothing with ist fecal namesake, being stringy, and beaten and as close as a teddy could get to looking luike a tramp without it semlling of urione. Sabah had felt sorry for it, he knew. Like her mothegr, shet took in strays. Like me, Sr Amin thought, It had been her money, or more precisecely (and remindedly) her family's money that had powered him through medice school, their coins slipped to him as though credit into tht e slot of the old meter oustoide the flat they usedc to own. They had been unhappy, theer, he remembered, It had been shit. His fiungers didn't linger on her.

He couldn't keep his mind o his daughter when he had to thinkm about going up the rabbit hole.

Take your medice, he thoguth, as he had said so manyt tiem,s, down the years, with patienst who he got on wit 9they all did) and with whom he had developed that level of rapport (they all had).

He walked to the lioft down the corridor that passed the oincology ward, hos tesictcless jigling to the rhythm of the rst of him . The bag was easy to carry, for now. He pressed the button, but not the down arrow, but the 'I'. There ws a crackle like that of a contened cat and the cat ' Dr Amin knew its voice ' said 'Arvand's realm is rootles, i9f you know what I means' and the doors slid open wth the smootnes of losing conmsciounses under anaesthetic. The cat sat to attgention in the centre of the lift. Dr Aminstepped around it and sa I the coner to its left. Not wher it had been. It wanted nothing of its warmth. He did n't deserve the charirty of anuthign on Allah's earth, but itw asn't that. the cart freked him out. As the lift doors shut, he rose and pressed the emnergencty stiop button and resaeated himself in athe puddle of cold tiles and weaited for the power to cut, as it often did, and the emergency light to kick im. He knew what he would would, had seen it before, though the hospital did not have a basement. The mortuary and crematoroium was on the same level, connected by a glass tunnel, allow with all of the service de[artments and the boiler, et al, soemthign to do with the hardness of the gorund on which the foundation s had been laid. There wasn't a basement, but under the red glare of the emergency lights, a level below ground floor lit itself, on the panel in the lift. It said, clear as a powercut night, - 1. I clothe ion bed shouldedimg nand hipping and buttocking him backward but the cold seeps in through wrinkles in the linen. It is this, everytime I need to urinate, or he does. He tells me to piss here and is half joking, I think or not oking at all. There's a deep vein of perversion about him, has always been., but it could be the warmth he's thinking of, rather than with his cock, though the odds would be on the latter. Whcihever way, brain or penis, I have liong been of the opinion that it's a cock doing the thinking. Still, as into the warmth of opur pressed bodies, it starles me how easy it is to give in, to sink back in, to be married again, like the ring on his fin ger suggests, and the bareness of mine denies.

The words raise an image of him, but he has rolled awau, conmtent in his own heat, and the divot of it I have left behind. He loikes to call himself lazy, making of himself an excuse. I remember how much crap I let him get away with, and it drives me parallel to the window, but I stop. My eyes are caight by a fleet movement, down and to the right, and they in turn tifg my body. Frozen as much as my muscles will allow my limbs to I move nothing but my head and stare. It si gone, white and vague as a ghost might, passi ng from the lights of the Hills, and out intot eh snow. Snow, I had forgotten it was snowing. How, I don't know. Perthpas this is like saying I had forgotten thei was air outside the window. It had become part of the landscape, nothing more.. It ewas a man, though, of that much my eyes were sure. Clothes had become important to me, like a leper with their skin, I am forever checking that my sleeves cover my fingers, my hems my heels, my hair tucked greasily as strips of old rag into my collar. Not cuts noweher, no holes. No, He was wearinga vest and a pair of boxes and either socks or snow clingin g where he had trodden. As good as a ghost out there. As a pedestrian to roadkill, I wanted to keep walking, ignore, him, but he had twitched, he lieve,d and I couldn't. The inconveniec of my shoivering limbs increased as I realised I was walking toward the stairs, the doors to which opened without so much as a creak, which they good have done, in all fairness, with all this talk of ghosts. It ws hard not to feel that the hospital was haunted, what with everybody going missing. It yhad been two days since I saw a member of staff. Nuirses, I thinl, amd step back, allowing the staoirwell door to close, sealing beside my nose. They could ring down. I wpuldn't have to go down. I walked to the station at the other end of the corridor. Spread forms, pens, than k you cards, instructions pinned to the wall. Emergency call 42. I pick up the phone, press the receiver to my ear. It is aking purring sound. Not beeps, pressed together for heat, but purring, as that of a cat, ;ike the soun don the the lift's information. 'What is wrong with this fucking place,' I scream, and ramm the receiver aginst the handset, which skitters off the counter loike a startled cockroacj,. Amd falls to the floor takin, a snaking second afterweards, ythe receiver with it. If Tony had been with me he would have blanched at the swear word, the soutern twat, and looked awy as though admonishing me with the lack of eye contact. The silebece of the corridor sounded like it ewas doing the same. Abruptly I couldn' hear the beeping of montiotrs., the buzz of elecrtrics badly connected, the flicking of long, inductrial lightbulbs. I round the wooden hem of the station. It, alone on the furntiuute ios smooth, well dusted, like a dress on a corpse. I open the door behind it. There is a creak, but not iof the door. Rope, I reckon, though I can't see it beyond the tights, the nurses dress around her tighted knees, the polished shoes, the right of hcih winks as her body swings delicately in the breeze I have brought with me. I think , sorry to disturb you, as my eyes widen (I can feel them on my pale face, like sptreading, darkening ink stains on paper). I can't see her head, only the long lank hair that falls on her navuy blue shoulders, obscuring her name badge, and the fuzzx of her features remnind me of dreans when I know it's me, but I cab't quite see. I let the door shut in my face, and allow its impct to strike me out of the room. It's no more than a cupboard, really, I think. A tiny little cupboard. Just a cupboard. A cupboard. Cupboard. I would have thought I was in shock , hut, of course, I didn't, and turned and walked away. I could have blanaced a book on my head. No shaking. If there was anybody left to wurtness me they might have described me as stately. I had allowed a, little of what my bladder had to offer out into my knickers. The daintiness didn't last long. As I stumbled down the stairwell, a zombie would have been ashamed of my gait. The concrete steps bit at my heel, chipped away at my resolve. I slowed. Was I sure? I turned to the door on level one, and pressed through, and stopped. If I wass honest with myself I had heard it before, but had chosen dishonesty not to hear. The chant came up, not trhough the floor boards, there were none of theswe, but seeped through the skin of the hospital, a heartbeat through ribs and epidermis. The chant of, 'Red Army.' Red Army. Red Army. In a beat, beat-beat. My mind thoguth of the drums of the deeps of moria, the bridge of khazadum, the nameless sfear, and I ignord it. I whistled to myself. 'Build me up butercupm,' possibly, by the Temptations. Anythign but the soun d of the 'Red Army.' I was beside myself ' my reflection, without realising I redached the window. I jolted.

I whispered, not too loud., tnot loud enough to be heard, but loud enough so that I could not herear them, below, in the depths of the Hills. I had heardc it somewhere, I thought, couldn't get it out of my mind, I hoped. Itw as better than other tunes. There was a ded man in thes snow. It was nearly definitely a dead man, though the snow was the same candour as what I thought of as skin, as boxed shorts, and as the socks, and his eyeballs were rolled, erphaps, because there was nothing of asn iris about them. It wasn't a body was it, though, it could it be that the snow had now covered it, while I watched. It wasn't one of the ta's I had seen on the way in. There was no way to be sure of this, was there. No way to know if I'd imagined him staggering out of the hospital, his limp, the scuff in the snow by the door I could still see. I was one floor up from the hillock of white and th dchant of Red Army was one floor down. I couldn't., could I? I had walked passed road kill that wasn't dead, as a child, many years befor eon a country lane, mortified in a way that it wasn't (itw as still twitching,lolling, salivating onto the tarmac, along with the blood and thw orms of its guts) at the thought of someone seeing me there, movi ng its body. I hated to be seen. I couldn't leave him, as I couldn't leave it, and yet did, my conscience a clawing weight at my back- mlike the silhoutee in the hiospitl walls -, tryuing to drag me aaroudn and down the stairs. I couldn't go down there, and thatwcouldn't was bogger. 'Red Army;' the ground flor chanted. 'Why? Why?' I whispered. I had forgiotten the rest of the lyrics. (occasional silences, breaking rthew gunshots and their echoes) With a click the emerfgnevcyt lighting came on and, with it, the -1 on the list of butons. Finger shivering as though he were admonishing the number, Dr Amin pressed it and closed his eyes. The red of the ankle height lights dressed the stairwell up like a brothel. A flush paints my nape and cheeks na forehead which has nothing to do with the lights, not even shame, for a change, but come sof panc, and is everything to do with a a state of emergency. My body is ain a state, my heart ratcheting about my rib cage like a ball in a pinball, seweking a hole, and a bonus. Momentarily I realise that etche d onto the walls are straight boughs, and dopping pods, as though from a canopy fo trees unseen not because it dpesn't exist (it doesn't exist, does it, my mind manages) but because the ceiluing of the stiars, the storey above, cuts off the vista I can see. (I shouldn't be able to see it, should I?) A moment later realise the cryuing sound I can hear come s form the silhouette of a child ' a girl- s bent retching beside one of the bughs, upon a knee of shadow that would take the shape of roots, if it were not cut off by the concrete frloor I stand upon. That is solid. Despite therg a sole and socks between me and it, I am sure of this- that my footing ios comcrete. From her little black mouth, from the the concave shap[e that I can only assume is it's voiding, a clump comes, like macated cereal, anf fall from view. As a child, as I do now, I hated crowds. Am hyperaware, the prescence of others like arassh of fingertops , whether ot not they are cloise enough for contact. They had didscomforted me, crowds, at every gathering I was forced to atgend, except once, when I went to my school hall and wartxhed a shadow play. Then, they, classmates, teachers, all, disappeared. How a scsene that looked less real than a T.V's, or that which closed in about my huddled shoulders, the rootish hardening of my cerosslegs, took my mind, how two d fin gers can reach put and strip away my consciousness, bending all of me into the canvas on which itw a splayed. I didn't know. I don't kniow now and it does the same. More real than a child with depth, the silhouette, and it's a girl, her pig-tails drooped as tshe vomited. By the darker darkness of the hairt's shadow, I can see they are uinwashed, lank, greasy, even before she manages to vomit on the tatterd end of one of her tails. She straighten in a snap, like atwig broken, but backward, and turns. Her eyes are unseen but I kno she is looking. Her mouth is no longer concave,a nd I imagine a thin line that is beginning, just, there I can see it, to tremble. Her ears are not visible,a md would not be bending toward what she can hear, whatever it is, but they may was well have been. She ebnds all of her ill will upon it. By the grip of her fists, she is gathering up her hatred. By the contriction of her shouldes, fear seizes her, and is squeezing. Like toothpaste, slow and gloopy,. She begins to run, past me on the wall to my left and, by it, not through the closed door to level 1, but between the jamb closest to me. The pods othat hang from the unseen canopy shiver as though someone were walking over their graves. There is a wet sound, an army of slugs on the move, perhaps, but no, I can see it.

The girl has stopped. There she is, beside a curtain whih shrouds a bed. She has collapsed on her knees before it. I remember the cfreatuer behind me doesnm't need to open the door. Ot would pass asround it, as it eos around this reality. I wish it would take the longest way around, having nothing ot do with this world of mine, but I can hear it. I realise, in this ward, mon its wall,s there are no shadowpuppetry trres. The girl is sobbing, but not around vomiting. I can hear the pop of drool from her nose. She says, 'please, please, no.' I guess she likes trees, I think. There are patients in the bed s around me, silent but for the beeping of their pulses on the monitirs attached to their beds. Did it say coma ward ont eh door, where I ht it? Like brialle, I'm sure I can feekl 'Coma' etched into my palm. It feels numb. I'm sure I can see the curtain(it's blue, despite the emergencyt lighting) waft. The small darejer blue diamonds weaved into its weft, like those into a royal gown, manage not to glitter at all as the curtain moves. There must be a breeze. Not, good, I think. That will let the cold in. I realise I am not cold, nor even cool, but am sweating.

The creature tat has chased us, however, does not move, except it's drip-drip-drip of internal luiquids finding the outside of it, anmd rolling downwsard. I want to move toward her, but she's nmot real, is she? That woul be crazy as a child m who watched a shadow play, crying when the princess was captured in the drk woods by the evil goblins.

The girl is shaking, the outline of her silhputte going potato like thayt of her piursuer. Tnetentacles reaches her bowed, small, tight head and spears to sniff even thougn ti couldn't possibly have a nose. My cheeks itch and I realise tears are falling on them. I resist the urge to look at the ceiling. It's too dark up there to see, and beside,s I know I am crying. The little girl's sklin goes all the more potato, mash-almost, as the tentacle attaches to her head and begins to suck, gulping her up. Then, it si beyond carohydreaes and she is slurpy it is guzzling down. She screams once, not for long, until her head and throat have been swallowed. What is left of her abdomen isn't one for screaming. When it is done, the tenecale recedes behind the curtain. Just alittle old man, I think, playing us all luike an organ. It isn't. 'This hospital is good, isn't it,' said a voice bside my right hand. I want to ump, to shush it, but I don't dare move anuythign but my head. It is the tin man, recognisable from a hundred viewing even in the half-red light, in my half-black sight. He opens his chesta dn it comes apart without so much as a squiewk, let lone a creak. Inside, as red as the emergency bulbs, was a heart, beating. 'Look what I got,' he said, face poroud as a tin man's could be. 'And me,' the bed to my left.

Like on e half of a zombie. I pull back the curtain. It run in hitches, each catch psqueaking on the plastic rail as though to say, 'are you sure, are you, are you?' There he is. The lion, or what is left of him. His mane as fallen out, his cranium bald, his eyes big and running as overcooked pies. They look like he is about to crumble. The lines atht saline into his arms seem as big as the limbs themselves. He appears to be trying t smile, to face her as he must be doing cancer, but his teeth cut him, an his eyes cry all the more. I guess they won't stop bleeding for a while. His pillow is matt with thick blood, and I'm sure he has done this before. He whispers something to me. I am too far away. Is he whispering to bring me within bit of his maw, I wondr, but I bend nonetheless. 'You need to go over there,' he is saying. 'You need to go over there.' There are shadows on the wall that are not mine and are not his. They have con'gressing ' I may ot have seen them but they have been watching me. The wall darkens like an ink stain spearding on red cardbioard. The shwdaows are going to leak through, the ink too much for the wall's density. There ais acrack and a crack appears, red again amidst the black. The red here, unlike thata of the eremegency lighting glistens, wet with a liquid that might eb blood, mioght be cancer. The tumour int eh wall is growing, metat6ising at a rate that would cause an ioncologist to piss themsleevs. It redaches out, the root of atentacle, toward us, and I stumble away, hotichign back onto my right knee, my lkedft out infront of me as though my body has decieded that now whould be a rreat time for what it could manage of thew splits.

With the soundof sucking lumps of vomit back up from anopse, the cancer takes him through the walls, the tumour disappearing, until there is nothing but the crack, inside which is a darkness like that at the heart of black./ The ligts come back on. The hospital judders as though this- all this going on- is becoming harder. Soemwhere between a break dance and a stunble I staggfer into what is left unravveleld of the curatina nd bat it back from my face. Momentarily, I refuses to go anmd, like insecst a forgein country, IO am fighting ti for longer than I an anticpated. I think I am going to see empty beds, when I finally clear it. Instead, in every one, there is a body. Not living, there are no beeps in eher, but corspses. It takes a moment fro my mind to wade through the sight fo desicatted grey skin, mottle clawed hands, the smell of faecsea nd urine, to realuse no nurse had been into the coma ward for some time. I feel like screainmg, but, thinbking of the lion, don't and gulp dfown my tears.

Dr Aminw as naked, what appeared to be the burst tatters of a child's y-fronts around his thighs. He fell to his knees with a crack soenwhre between the metallic of the floor and the bone of his knee caps. Hidden, now, beneath his buttock,s his feet up to his calves were covered in dirt. His arms, eblow the elbows, zooro'd with red lines. If h had not been in a rapier fight, he had taken flight through a dense thicker, and used his arms to protect his eyes. His eyes were red as though he needn;t have bothered. He opened his hands and opened his mout and pressed the former against erh latter. From the utside, it would have seemd that he intended to eat his palms, before moving up to his fingers, but the low, asthmatic sound indicated that he was screaming. His eyelids peeled back his tenmples and forehead, euyes bulging and tearing, as his nose ran first with gunger and the a a thin, diluted line of blood as the scream became something his head could no longer contain and, a the doors fo the lift closed, its sound caqme. Ping 'You can't just lie around,' her words came at him as diod the waves of pain. As thougbn simultanteusly partticlezs, they pierced him. 'ERgghhhghnay?' 'Get up. Get up. You have to beat this.

'Arggghhhbhhh,' he said, as his shattered calf reminedec him there was more to the world than the cold. Everything was forceful; air like dawn water on the skin, breath force feeding him, pain. 'Look,' her toen had turned placatory, a calm, cold rag on his ears. Thatw as the leats of Tony's comcerns. 'Lean on me.' She rearranged his limbs to lope over her high shoulders. 'Good. C'mon, just a few steps. You ahvew to start getting better. You have to. You have to.' The room rotated, the wider world seemed fulcrumed to it. Still, he was sure enough that she shouldn't' just keep saying, 'You have to.' 'Please,' Tony said. Like a straw ina stack of needles, of bunched pain, he had found his tongue. 'Let me lie down. I'm going to be sick.' 'Just a few steps. Go on. Another.' 'Shiiiiiit.' 'That's it. Look would you like some music. I couldn't get spoytify on the laptops, the internet won't load up. But I found this radio. It's longwave, canm you believe it?' She was talking too much. Staving off asn inevitably. Tonyt wished he kenw what it was. It firghetened her, and by extension down his arm to his abdomen, him. 'Here we go.' 'Why'' plaintive singing. Tony realised it was him. '' do you buiodl me up'' the radio continued. 'Yeah, walk with the beat. You're douign really well. That's it. That';s it. One more step.' 'Please.' The song continued. Getting over thre bridge took an eternity, but then she laid him back aginst the linen of the bed. He shivcered out sweat, shaken as water from a dog;'s fur, 'Please,' he continued, though it was over. Tonmy realised he was speaking to his stomach, which felt like it wanted to start something. He managed to pass out before it did. There were times when her absdence ws a rash onb where she would normally hold him, the the forearms above his wrists, his chin, a it pressed intot he ciuirved place at the top of her back, their ankles, where skin met skin beneath their pjama bottoms and above the layered socks. There when her precence was the lights eye-doctors ebam behind the corneas that make you feel as though you are going blind from the inside out. Happiness had never been Tony's spirit level, the bubble settling more easily into despondency. But this, this moving, coulnd't go on, 'Just one more step.' 'You can do it.' 'Come on.' Caught between the rocky place of he pain and the endless soft sea of the drugs, he didn't know if he were coming or going, but was sure that, when she hoisted him up, it felt as if the walking would never stop. 'Fucking hell, man, just get a move on, Christ.' Even here in the endlessness that mnade the end of days seem like they would never end, he didn't eant to diplease her. Pleasing could come or go, but he was southernor, and couldn't be doing with the swearing, or her displeasure. 'One more. Fucking hell,' desperation. ' come on.' So, he went. 'Christ.' Though itw as hard to kniw where his consciousness came into it, where nothing xsimply stoped, at first he thought he was lying side on in an underwater cave. He had drowned, maybe. It would be some tiome before he remembered he was Tony. The light, off white, off in a way that plasdtic could never quite loomk like gold, wavered as though someone were varnishing his eyeballs, and his brain behind them. He tried not to blink. He tried stillness, for awhile. He didn't want tor ock the boat, even if it appeared that the boat was lying at the bottom of an underwater cave, was a wreck. If I'm drowned why is my mouth so dry? It went beyond this; not dry; desert desiccated; not his mouth, only, but his lips and, further, the ridged, flaking fins around them, and the throat the other way. shit. The laquering of his perception was beginning to harden. Amber ridges of sight through which he could see shit the cave was a duvet, no; two, the lips of one closing aroud that of the first, hanging, dog-tonguisly in one place. Shit. It stank in here, and, now he was up and running, at least in his skull, it didn't take Tony l;ong to realise the smellw as him. It wasn't his brain that was swearing but, ina visceral way, his leg. It shot him up with pain. Shot after shit after shot, forcefeeding him, drink this, then salt. Lemon. He blinked breaking his own ruels and moving. Therew as a wall beyond the hole at the end of his duvets. He reached out and blinked again at the fact that this was his hand. His over gronw, rat-tooth nails, dirty fingerprints fo knuckles. There was blood on his right index. Now, he saw that, he noticed his right nostril felt thick, as, he thought, a penis after sex, before pissing. He wonders if he's had a nose-bleed, if he picked it in his sleep, until it ran. He had what he roughly reffered to as narco-picksy. He can't help himself, he thinks. A shadow falls across the hole in his sheets. It has a gravestone quality, indefatible, endless, with enough detail he shoud be able to guess its owner. As the darkness desceneds towards him he gets it, Joanne Stones, 1979 ' present. She is holding her hands open. On each rests a pill.

'Sure. They should both help with the pain.' She presses it to hiom and he doesn't like to refuse her so he lets it in. Besides, his leg is a spit roast of pain.

It has begun to mist and fogs even as he allows her to tip it into him. She is wearing enough layaers to lokm as fat as she thinks she is/. Tony swallows. Down the rabbit hole, he thinks. His mother used to say that, long before the tumour. 'Listen, Tony.' He stares up at her. He is close by her breast, he can feel the edge of its curve along with the fullness of possibility. He stirs, but his face remains still, eyes watching her, dark blue like tarns the twilight sky. 'Tony, are you listening to me?' Tony nods. The look on her face seems to be looking for it. Nod. He adds another for effect. Nod, knock. Tony frowed. Does his head make that noise? 'I think we're going to have to go further up, Tony. The Red Army. They're killing people who aren't joining them, Food's running out.' Knock. He hadn't nodded. 'I don't think they like you.' What? He squints at her, his neck stiffening, his head going straight with it, as though she has grasped his chin. Knock. 'What is that?' That wasn't in my head, thought Tony, thinking not of the sound, but of her question. She had heard it. The Knock-knock. 'What is it?' she says. Whos' there? Joanne had turned enough now for Tony to see. On the wall of his room was a silhouetted little girl. With long dark hair draped down in the way of Japanese horror movies. She held up one fists, as much in warning as in knocking. Knock-knock-knock. It fell with a gravelly, intimately boney sound at odds with the concept of a silhouette. Only her knocking seemd to keep her vertical. The wall may as well have been a window. The fist fell and, omn its impact, Tony grasped his eyes. He felt his paloms on the balls as thogh cold rags on coals. Insiead of a knuckle on brick there had been a flash of light. He opened his fingers a smidge, squeezing his sight out from between them. He could see inside the little girl. The silhouette had become an x-ray. Her heart beat, lungs shivered as though upturned trees in a breeze, a white lump that shouldn't be there sat beneath he chin like a swallowed slug. Knock-flash. He squealed. The bursts of white light in hsis ight dwindled, rubbed out by the backs of his hands, and he saw that the slug had grown in her throat. It appeared to be feeding on her. It appeared to be a tumour. The shadow had collapsed to its little kness. It was attempting to etch. No, worng way round, it was trying to breathe. And another sound. At thought, Tony thought had become unmanned and was soiling himself. He wouldn't have blamed his spincter. All the other holes in his body felt as though they were doing the same thing. Joanne had shrunk out of sight, maybe fainted. There was the wheezing ooze of newly birthed poo. But Tony couldn't smell it, and his clenching buttocks couldn't feel it. He ws sfinding it increasingly difficult to breathe. The wet sound was xcoming from below his ears, here, where he was sat, twisted against the bedframe, but not fro a sfar dwon. He grabbed at his throat. It was distended as the little girl's had been, and wet though not bleeding. He too one had away, grasping at it as he had at with his fingers. He couldn't even wheeze. His eyes were bulging as, he kenw from the feel, was tumour on his throat. If he looked down, he could see it peaking, caulish, over his chin. He thought of cigarette packets and passedc out. (and over it all, the clutch of her rib cage like that of an eagle's claw over a small prey.) Tony woke with a gasp. After this, eh went further and wheezed. When he had finished doing so, he sucked, his lips vibrating like a blocked hoover duct. He held his neck, prodding his adam's apple in quick, viperfish movements, as though it might bite him. He stared iout through the acve of his twin duvesta nd knew, straight, that it was linen, and not a cave at all. A shadow fell across what would have been its entrance. Joanne, thought Tony. She held two pills. Blue. Red. Tony tried to gulp but didn't have the saliva to do it. 'Listen, Tony. I'm sorry but I don;'t know how much to give you. These were both in the pain meds area, but I don't think you should take more than one, just in case. So, it's the rde, or th blue, you know, ' she gave a laugh which abruptly hitehedc, like it had come up the wrong way, 'like in the M'' He snatched the blue from her palm ans walloed it, despite his lack of saliva.

Itw asn't just the drugs, or the way most of the the clock's in this alce had at some point run out of battery, and there arms were now staved in place, like those of formulatdied butterflies. Itw as the night. The end less night. Tony didn't know how long it had taken to ascend the stairwell or remember why, given the condition of his left leg, he had avoided the lift, but here he was, nowi, whenever now may be. Here, before his mother where it had, for him, all begun. 'I'm sorry, mum,' he says, holding his palm to his mouth, after this, as though he nhas burped at the dinner table. She doesn't respond, and isn't ignoring him, as she used yto, when he was atennegar, and used to purposefully do this kind of thing. He regretted being a teenager, these days, more than he had even then (and he'd hated it, wearing asSame Shit Differenmt Day so often he'd had to buy a spare, for the tiemws she stole iyt from his bedroom, and put the origonial in the wash). He felt embrassed. Yes, there was the range of stemches and fluids he had exuded through the years during and chasing puperty, and for some of these she had to taken asiudde, but the embarrsement of being a teenager shamed him, now. Being embarrsesd by adults, by parents, by his mother in particular. Thatw as an issue that stained him still. She ' adults- hahd had thew last laugh, he thought. He qs finally punished and still a failure and after all he had claimed the would be. After claiming he wouln';t end up as them. His mother lies, like Elliot said, like na corpse etherised on the slab. Not dead, but as on the edge fo being wiped out of existenmce as eveubody else in huimanity. Now they had othing but night and, though they had been wiped clean l;ike chalkl froma slate by cloufds for some time now (always that expression, some time, he had no way of telling what the some, was though it seemd to add up to longer than he could stand, and less left than he could stomach). 'I'm sorry,; he repeated, as if she had n't heard him the first time, which she hadn't ans wouldn't no matter if it came a third, or fourth. Or more. He hadn't understood the dimishing retruns of adulthood, or how it would eat at him, at the pith of all he had considered success, as cancer had eaten at her, her brain. In the end, life was the winner, the parasite, and all he had was withered. He held her by the forearm, not the hand, just above the wrist. Her skin was cool, her limb a joint, perhaps lamb. The beep-beep of the heart monitor continued, but could have been the con of the machine, just the sound of it winking at him. Yepm, she's alibve, yep ki, believe it. 'I should have come by earlier,' Tony continued. 'I was just busy. Yeah, I'm still writing. No, I don't know how my book is doing. Guess not so well now. But the new one is looking good.' She hadn't never been interested in this. Perhaps, thought Tony, he sought to push her away from conscioness. Who would want their mother to wake to this. The girl in the bed to his left had been taken. The doctor's girl. He was sensible. He had stopped this going on, thought Tony. The orther, who he would have cponnecetd with the two bald men in the car, if he had anything but self-contrition left about him, was a blot of shadow against the far wall, almost as though he were sinking into it, ioceberg ish, more in the world beyond than this. 'No, I habven't leartnt how to drive yet. L:ook, I'll learn in my own good time. You, know, I live in the city and Joanne doesn't really care about me learning. She likes to drive. I think it gives her indepence. I think'' He is crying and realsises it only because, depszite the wan, skin coloured light not fading, he can no longer properly see. 'You, I keep meaning to say.' He swallowed hard as he had on the blue pill. 'We're getting a divorce.' He shuddered. Somebody was walking over his marriage's grave. 'I'm sorry.' She didn't say anything. She never said anything when she was disappoprinted until, eventually, she would say, 'I don't know, I;m sorry, but I'm just dsiappoinetd in you. Tony.' She didn't say it, not uyet. He swallowed again, threw back the saliva like a shot, pinned down the tremours in his skin. 'I'll ome by again, Mum,' he sauys. 'I won't leave it as long, next time. I promise. I'lls ee you soon. Tae care. Love you lots.' It had been years since he had used 'love'. He din't leave, hwoever. His fingesr won't let go. 'Hold m,e, please, Mum,' he said,. She didn't, and he did leave. His body was arranged around him, moulded from the back outward, in such a way that Tony thought he should be saying 'the bells, the bells' as he dragged his left foot, thump, thump, thump, against the stairs.

It wasn't any more than the bone-breaking crack of gunpowder that echoed though the cordiors, and down the warda,s and up the concrete stairwells, anmd not t all, he was willing to bet, in the lifts. But it shot down his wonder, or whatw as left of it. He walked into the corridor to his room, and let the door to the stairwell slap together in the sound of a high five. He walked into his room. The lught was off and it took a while of his eyes adjusting to see that Joanne was staring at him, from the bed bed beside his, a dark smudge of eyes beneath her charcoal cross-hartch of hair, linen gghost white up to her chin. He tried to smile. Like most of the muscles he dragged behind him, it ached. 'Hey,' he said. There was a smell in here. He didn't need to be self aware to know most fo it was him, but theer was a timbre of her. A note, like that in soured wine, of belly-ache, of the potential for poison. She didn't reply. 'I went t see my mother.' All there was was the smell. It seemd to shift slightlu, letting out folds of its pungence, when nothing else in the room moved. He wondered if she had overdosed on the blue, or the red, because she couldn't go on. She loiked like she couldn't go on. This was a different kin d of wonder, he thought. It felt like dread. Then the answer, a mumble, as though words spoken clearly from the bottom of a well that needed to climb up two stones, sink down one, up two, fall one' 'That makes a change.' Her lips hadn't moved. If she were possessed itw s by an unergetic spirit. 'Look,' he didn't know what she should look at. Or why, ana d the imperative dwindled stubbornly in the air. 'You left me alone.' She said. 'I ws asleep and you left me alone in the dark. After all I've done for you.' She was crying. There was nothing in her tone that would suggest it, but a pair of glints in te dark, like tiny mirrors smuggled into her face. Tonyw as a sucker for tears. He walkede to beside her bed, on its left, and knelt, and tried to find her hand, her right, to hold it. She held onto the ghost-white linen, wouldn't let go,a nd so he gripped the outline of her digits, as if he held the businbess end of a cudgel. 'I'm sorry. I didn't think.' 'You never think.' His leg spasmed in this position. 'Hello' it sang at him, like Nirvana. It's the fucking drugs, you idiot. He chewed in his teeth, to stopper what came next, swallowed, regurgiatateed it, but in a softer form. 'I think it's te drugs. Thyve addled me.' He liked 'addled'. His editor had removed it seven times from his last manuscript. She was silent. Thatw as enough. If she'd disagreed, she would have said. There had always been something disargreeable, he wthoguth, about the way she disagreed. Blunt. So says the southernor, her voice chimed in his mind. They had argued over this before; how to argue. He squeezed her hands,a nd did so again, trying to pump hope into it. 'I'll tell you next time. I promise.' How many promises is that, now. She didn't boptehr to say this, and didn't need to. 'Come on. We'll do what you said. Move up to a higher ward. Heat rises, yeah? So it'll be hotter up there, and further asway from those idiots down below.' Her fist stiffened at this, below his palm. Tony ehard the creak of linen stretched to its breaking point. 'Come on,' he oressed gentkly, massaged her to roll over, allowing him in behind her. He staved an arm around her, remnind himself of the move men are supposed to make in cinemas. He cuddled her back into his chest, was careful to rest his right hand and forearm below her breast, but above her belly. In picking which, he would have gone for the breasts. He knew how she stiffened when somebody touched her stocmach. He felt himself stiffening also, but tried to make the motion of pressing his hips aginst hers an act of getting into bed, not a thrust, buta shuffle. Her smell was stringer, now. Neither of them could bear to dis-clothe, to shower, and the odours had accumulated between them as the insults in their marriage. Bitch, whore, arsehole, southern twat, and others, more insidious, you look like our mother when you're cross, you smile like you father, you prat, how do you think I could have sex with someone as fat as you, what are they chicken legs, like chuckinga sausage down a tunnel, more like a chipolata. A moement here, a strech there. She would be aware by now, that he was pressing between her buttocks. Neither said anything; it wa safer not to. She made the shortest of restivenesses, I the ebd, but it pused her aginst him, theerw as a wave of muscles opening up around where he was pressedc into her. He yawned, covered his mouth prettily, allowe the hand, when he placed it back, up, by degrees, to rest on her breast at the areola.

His eyes tell him he's feinted, until he sees a truck tyre, on fire and rolling past their car, the petrol over hhalf its circumference huffing out then heart-beating up, red and vicesarl in the cavity of Tony's sight. His own heart feels as big and as hot and as rubbery. He sees the tyre spasm as it reaches and shudders over the curve of the hard shoulder. 'What are the odds?' he whispers. All he can manage in response is, 'Where's the truck?' which at least rhymes with what he's thinking. On the M62, light is back, not in stars, but in the starburst of explosions, before headlights are flicked on, lighting up the motorway, improving the view not at all. This isn't good, he thinks. The scene through the windscreen is sieved light, beams jutting through, illuminating more than Tony wants to see. The only highlight of which is - in the outside lane - a BMW crashing into an Audi. A bright spot in a dark day. Show offs going out with a BANG. I can hear things. He realises it's him. 'Get out. Get out of the car!' he's screaming. Joanne is still ignoring him. Oh, yeah she's dead' he remembers before leaning forward, toward her belt buckle, head halfway over her lap. He jabs what red he can see. Click. There's a screech of tyres. The two sounds are unconnected but soon will be, by savaged metal and their blood limning it. His arms jangle above her passenger seat as though it's an electric chair. The CX jangles along with his luimbs. The wheels thudded below him, on his side, rtubberised heartbeats at speed. Raggedly, dollish for the first time in his estimation, his wife is thrown against him, and he stavened to the seat. His bottom seems to be eating the seating, spincter tightening, opening, gulping in fear. It must have been a passing blow, he thinks, a car clipping us, a dint. 'I can't see,' Tony screams, and shies from the high pitch of his voice. 'Shut up,' shouts someone closeby, and he realises it's his wife. Voice ragged as her body had been. Raw. 'I thought you were dead.' The voice- his voice- was an embarrassed whisper. 'I thought you were dead'' 'Just f---king wishful thinking,' says Joanne. That shuts him up. As does hearing the wail of a car horn and the sound, like a metal splinter in his ear drum, of car hitting car. Ahead, in the blank of his sight, fire lights up. There's the scattering of shattered glass, somewhere close by, across the tarmac. It sounds like the dust of a malicious fairy. 'Shit,' said Tony. He could hear his on profanity. It sounded especially southern.'Shit, shit, shit.' 'Stop swearing,' bellowed his wife, and he does. With a dazed blinking, like the rousing of a warren of rabbit eyes, the street lights come on above them, and in a string down the motorway. Seemingly, they light the apocoaplyse. He sees a hand against a window in a car int eh central reservation. It is making bloddied diacritics. Not enough life left in it to form a letter to accent. The car explodes. 'No,' he says. 'No.' He's interrupted by the ship-going-down sound of a lorry's horn. Stop lights and fire make the silhotte more distinct - a shadow-puppet shape of a Volvo. Inside - four heads, each turned Tony's way. They had stopped in the inside lane, in the queue behind the cars that had crashed before. The lorry was battering toward them. He heardf screaming, growing as though from below them, and then shooting upward in pitch like one of those annoiying binfire night rockets the show-of neighbours liked. He saw ahadows on the door locks, whoch refused to open. They were trapped as Catherine on her wheel. The headlights of the lorry light up their cab. 'Get out,' shouts his wife, pushing him. 'Okay,' he says. He would like a blind panic but watches as the lorry spin the Volvo past their bonnet. Its wheels, in their headlights, made a Crispy-Cream box-full of doughnuts on the tarmac. Sparks firework. The handbrake screams and it isn't alone. This is going to hurt, he thinks. The lorry's coming", "label": 1}

Pressed tight as they were, there was enougbn between them, bile and shame and sex-with-the-ex, to rapid them downstream, until he came. As he did, there wan another shot. He was aware of her joints cravking to attention, her hand stoppoing in her pants, but he was looding with shame and ectasy and trying to go with the second, until the first inevitably won. It did. She pushed him back,a dn kept pusing. 'Get aeay from me,' she said, her snarl undermined by sobbing. He was still, in part, ejacuilating, but the pain in his lg sent ist own shots to his mind, as he staggered to the floor, and around the bed, and to his own. He fell upon it, and would hgave t roll, later, into the duvets, dude rto the cold, but let it in for now, along with the loathing, not just his, but hers, her silent weeping that he haerrd only in the creaks of her bed frame, the way she punched her pillow. 'Can't you just Turn IT OFF,' SHE SAID. 'I can.' A pausr, in which he doesn't. 'You arsehole,' she says. 'I'm writing.' It sin't far off his other defences. I'm writing. I need time to write. I'm a writer. I'm a published author, you know. 'You know,' she has turned . He herad her bedgframe creak as though straining its neck to lisen. The darkness of her eyes and the glower o her expression beams sideways at him, intensifying. 'Even if you could write a hundred times better than you can, who's going to read it? You'll be no more bloody successful than when all te rest of the writers were still alive.' In the normal run of things, he would have been able to ignore her. Normaility had derailed far from its line, however and was, in the ords of any apocalypse movie trailer, carsh and burned. 'What the fuck is it to do with you? Why can't ypu just ley me live my life an dyou live yours, eh?' It was at time slike these that he reaslied he sounded like a soap opera. This worried him. H eguessed it was the way normal people talked at time sof stress, but he had spent a life-time selling himself the lie that he was different. And he had been buying. She wsns't looking at him anynor,e but the lack of motiojn of his pen between the lines of his novel meant she would know she'd gotten to him. You're a bitch, he wrote, to give the impression of witing, you're a bitch and I wish you'd just fuck off with those stupid, rankenstein browed imbeciles from downstairs. Just fuck, fuck, [the words incrasse toa furios large scribble] FUCK OFF. It wasn't a gunshot but the gun came into the room with all the shock and suddenness of one. It was attached to a glove, at the end ofwhich was a khaki coloured jacket beneath which, Tony knew but could not see as te jacket was farsoned, was a red t-shirt. The carf wrapped around Davey's neck was red and bkacka dn shot throughnw iuthn devils. Tony shrunk like a hibernating flower into hi bed. Raysy carried the sentiment. 'Alright pansy? How's it going hopalong? Leg alright.' In the beside Tony, Joanne was stil. She had learn that, he knew, in her childhood. First nature. In moments like these Tony thought he would have the words, as they did in the movie-scripts. He was a writer, after all. He had one, though, but it was, 'Yug,' at leats, according to his ears,a nd he would have to look up what that meant, in the dictionary. H ehoped itw as something brave. Davey ignored it. 'Look,' he said. 'Don't pay any attention to the gun, it's only a precaustion, right?' Don't think of pink elephants, thought Tony, staring at the barrel. The gun was lowering, going longer in hbis vision, but less holed. Momentarily., he was glad iyt was in Davey's hand and not Raysy's. It semed safer, there. 'Aye, this is just a formality, like,' said Raysy. 'We're hgoing to ask a question, you're going to say yes,a nd we're going to let you into our club, okay writer boy?' Tony nodded. He tried to say ytes. His feet felt like umping up and down on the spot and had to make to with jiggling. 'Oh, sorry, love, diddn't see you there,' said Raysy to Joanne. 'You don't meed to worry about this, all this question business, it's only for the men. Women are, what's the word Davey?' 'I have no fucking idea what you're talking about.' 'It means, like free, like it's ladies night.' 'Gratis?' said Davey. 'Bingo,' said Raysy. Tony swallowed. He thought the gulp could be heardc in the corridor, the stairwell beyond, echoing about the hospital long cold, halls. 'What's the'' he managed. He swallowed. 'Question?' said Raysy. Tony nodded. 'Are you with us?' said Davey. 'Are you in or out?' 'Fancy joing the Red Army.' 'Yes.' It came quick, as he had earlier. 'Good oh,' said Raysy. Tony nboticed he was carrying a black object, not a gun, but as long, wider, a box. Raysys opened it. A cylinder of glass mustered a glint in the wan light, and he saw appoint. A needle, his brtain surmised, joining the dots. 'Welcome to our gang.' Dr Amin knew where the aneasteesologist kept his alchohol.

Whiskey tasted as he looked. He had yried it once, at university, and the taste it left on tongue spread only to his conscience. Too long in the medical world, he had blanmed it, and took the bride his family found not long after. This time he blamed on ending his world. The tatse had made hiom think of the time he had accidentally swallowed a locust as a child in the Swat Valley. His earliest memory, it had made him somehow, he thought as an adult, bitter, inhuman on the inside,a sif the animal had roosted, bred, made him as riddle don the inside as his daughter had been. She wasn't his daughter anymore. To all intents and purposes, he knew, she wasn't a she anymore. 'That's fine,' he said. He placed the bottle on his desk in his officve. The bottom of the bottle rattled as though he has spun it between his wet palms. He wore more than he had on returning to the lift, but at some level he recognised that tgh temperature was dropping and, if he wanted to live free of the flu., or viruses, he should seek the shelter of further clothing. He didn't. He raised the tight, prim, shocked-lipped circle of the bottle to his own. It only totok a few secons to make contact. 'That's fine,' he repeated, as he did when he wanted colleagues to shut up and move on. A modulated voice.You couldn't even hear the shaking. He didn't swig, but stared down the bottle at his daughter. She sat in nthe chair ont the opposite side of the desk, one eye open and another closed. Her chest bended softly tot eh beat of a heart within, as a willow in a slight wind, but she wasn't alove, not in any mearuse of humanity. For some time now she had been less riddled by cancer than by humanity, and, now, the tumour had filled her up like the stuffing in e teddy bear. Even his sojourn beyond the end of the elevator hd been unable to save her,. He glanecde at hisa wrist and tilted it by degrees. His rolex glinted on the little light cast by the lamp in the corner of his office. Wet on his lips. The loamy, slinking, bog-dwelling smell of shame. He didn't open nthem. Staring, he was surprised their were no steech marks on the skin of wrist, pale silver streches like that left by water in dried out gul;lies, or those on the busted guts of mothers. Momentarily, He wished he could be young, again. Again. Dr Amin imagined falling and, involuntaryily, he breathed hard around the bottle end, making a noise like that the air would make when he jumped.

'That's fine,' he says, to himself, in a a some what harder tone. It isn't every dfay you meet your maker, and it would probably be better to do so sober, all things considered. He gritted his teeth, a sensationtha reminds him of his tone, of his decision, and rises and wlaks around the desk to what had been his daughter. It was comfortin g to think there was something of her left inide, a speck he could see if he gazed into her eyes, but, tonight, the comfort had the same texture as his teeth, and the temperatire of the room, the world. She was fileld, head to toe to the end of her fingers with tumour. King Canday has her, Every single cell, King Candy has her, And on the Big Sea she sails. Where had he heard that, he thinks. Oh yes, Over There. She held, in her right hand with the fin gers that were thick with cancer and unable to unclench, her teddy, Winnie. A fan of Disney, she had named him after her favourite charcter, thoughhe looked nothing like Milne's character, but wass arancid yellow which reminedde Dr Aminfo the whiskey, one missing eye, and a mouth so badly stiched he could have been a wound. It appeared to be winking at him. Dr Amin winked back and lifted his daughter into hsia rms and said, 'Time to die.' She was heavier than he remembered but then beinga girl shaped tumour would do that to you. 'That's fine.' As a doctor he would liem to think he wasn't weeping. As a man, he wwalked tot eh stairwell, his daughter clenched to chest and rose up the steps to the roof. Being heavy, she weghed down his ascent,a nd it would be some time before he reacheh the roof-door. When he go tthere, he would stare thorugh it West, toward the coast. Even from the hills he would be able to see the rising of clouds from the sea to the sky, liekm waterfall in reverse. He knew what it was.

Raysy lent foeard, Tony;s book in his weak hand as though he were a player. The description of shirt collar does not fit him. The forehead was too thick. 'Like this mate?' Rayssy says. 'This the metaphor you were on about?' 'It#'s a simile,' says Tony. 'What, like?' 'It's a similie, not a metaphor.' Tony was not in the position to argue, which, as I know from years of marrauge, means he is. He isn't the posiotn to much but lie. They have used beige straps to tie him to the bed, the leather excesses hanging off its frame, dry and loose as tongue from dehyrdaretd dogs. They took them from 'Psych' they said. The Raysy lent and shouted 'Psych' in Tony;s face,. There wss a smell, now, rising from the ha-ha line of blue linen between his legs. Davey hoilds the gun to Tonys heads, at arm's length as though ti is a bomb, instead. Raysy stand straight, using his thumb to worm opne the next page. His other hand hold a needle at the end of which is a tube at the end of which si a pot of ink a sblack as a squid's attack. Tony's book says 'Amy and the Teddy' on it's front, in white on yellow, but the lines raysy is reading do not come from that texrt. H eis reading between the line,s from the book Tony as been writing there , his 'apocoaplyse novel' as jhe keeps calling it. It all seems a bit close to the knuckle, doesn't, now? I thinl. Or abit close ot the forehead. Raysy brings the needle in his hand close to Tony's face,a nd presses a button. The end of the needle begins to judder, like a junkie inneed of a fix. 'By the end of this, pal,' says Raysy, ' you'll be wishing you have a'' he svcans the tecxt in front of him, ''brow as bloody pretty as mine.' 'End of what?' Tony says. It has all the raggedness of amlst breath. Raysy drops the book and with crook of spare fingers, rolling up the sl;eeve of his jacket, and then the twinned layers of his jumpers. Instead of a punch, he prsenets an old tattoo, of a devil, which stands on his forearm. Tony knows then, and stares across at me, eyes desp[erate on my expression. He has bad timing. Just then, I change. Therew asn't much to it. A realisation that, with the ball thrown and spinning on the wheel of fortune, by money is on the wrong number. There isn;'t much to it; the cock of my head toward Davey, the tilting of chin, the smear back of my fringe when Davey's not looking, and the hope, blazing on my eyes, so bright thst I can feel it, even from the inside, that Davey will look at me. Show me favour. I've changed my horse at the last post and Tony sees it. A darkness sinks into his gaze not so much loike some thing inside him as died, a that it is being buried alive. He hates me, now, I think. 'Right, ate,' says Raysys over the teeth-chattering sound of his needle, 'this old devil, ain't going to do itself. Stay still, I would.' The needle goes in and all but Tony's headf moves, his body flailing aginst itself, limbs to ribs, legs togther. 'We need to know you're on our side,' says Davey. It sound as though he's talking himself through this. He hasn't looked at me. I can't move enough to attract his attention. To attract him. 'This is a mark, to show everyone you're on our side. So you don';t get picked on. We need to give you the mark of the Red Army.' ('There? There?' Tony's hisses it up against his teeth. So little of it sieves out it may not have been words at all, but only te drool that is pooling above in the concave dint below his adma's apple.) 'Look,' says Davey. 'Don't worry, we've cleaned the needle. But if it gets infected, just get some antibiotics from the stock cupboard behind the nurses station. You'll be fine. Fine.' He would have curled up into a ball if he wasn't held straight by the straps. As a child he used to rock, ehad-dwon, on the carpet, knees drawns beneath his chins as though oscillating himself out of existence. As a child he had run away from home, though the run had slowed to jog and the n a crouch, and away had been as far as the all around the corner from their front door. His parents hadn;'t been taken in by the pretence. At the time of leaving, he had. 'Get them off,' he shouted at her. 'Why don't you make yourself fucking useful and stop making fucking doe eyes and get these the fuck off.' She was a wavering mess in the corner of his right field of vision. If he hadn't been crying he would have been able to tell that she was wweeping. He felt the tug at his wrist of her doing a she had screamed, but his head was too busy jerking forward, chin chicken-beaking out, teeth clench into a line as tight zas any beak, to notice anything but the agony on the outside of hiss kull and within it. She untied his left hand side and his fist came away, unable to uncurl. He stood in a hiss like a gas escape. He felt ready to go. To run. To spark.

The sound was a slap. catcalls a scratch. Tony stumbled back aginst his injured calf. It gave beneath him with a sucking moist marshy sound, as though drawing him. Gammy, he thought. He flailed at the air. Somehow grasped balance. 'HE'S A RED A RED A RED TILL HE'S DEAD HE'S A RED.' 'Leave me alone.

'Hey, say excuse me. I was here first.' 'He's gone red in te face.' Laughter, some of it female. This was ahrper, like the teeth of vampires. 'What's that on your head, Tony Stones The Writer?' 'It's a Frankenstenien brow.' Laughter. 'Who's the Frankensteion, now, Tony Stones The Writer.' Tony was almost at the door, now. He see it's outline, a mirror before a world that had been turnd off. A m oster leered up in the glass, flailing and manglned beyond recognition, or nearly. He realised it wss him. Darkness atenneded the image of him, swiling about it. As he closed on the door, he saw it was crowd, jeering, cheering his exit. He walked into the door. Laughyter. The female cut throught he amle, incluing him. He remembered secondary school. The door was automatic but had not opened. 'Don't go, #oh please don;'t go,' someone sang, their voice high and popular. 'Don't leave us alone, Tony Stones.' A waith ion the corner of the mirro that was the hospital's front doors, he saw his wife, hanging back, wavering in and ou of visibility. He twisted his body more so than it ad been already, sideays like a broken straw, and swernched at the door, his fingers and their unclipped nails finding purchased between the lips, of cblack plastic. With a mddeneing grind like teeth on a bacjkboard and pop of cold air, the doors came open and he slid through. They closed as he went, on his trailing leg. With a harpiyish scream he wrench and barked it against the glass, crowbarring out hi limb. He was out, crawling up onbto a low hill, of snow he had not expected to be there so close to the doors. The crowd beyond the glass doors laughed him out, audible even through the panes. The skin blazing red with humiliation on his nape forcved himforard out into the night, like the millennium Falcomn from an exploding death star. He pretended to look uo. To care about the sky, to distract them, all of thos bastartds, from knowing they had not only gotten to him, but gottn inside him. The sky was dark and falling. Momemtarily, Tony realised it wass not the sky and not even a body, bu two, a man and a girl, beffoe he threw himself, back, against the hospital's doors. Pain screamed through his spine (I guess that's why it's called a window pane, a voice said in his mind, iobliquely, and it wouldmnbe some time before he recalekld he had though of Enienbem) and he bouneced forward. The bodies hit, the arm of one stretched out as though attempting to make a snow angel with its fakll. Tne wrist of iut caught his forhead. The tattoo on which exploede into agaony. (A devil of a thing.) and poped 3with wetness as blood deltaed from his eyebrows an around his nose and the clenching workings of his cheeks.

Rolex Nicks Man, he thought in Sun-Headline font, andbegan t sob. Sioemtiems he wished his mind would just stop. Give up and go home. He had done that before, when he was eight.

'he jumped with her. Poor miote. He landed on her.' And. 'she's aline. She's got a pulse. Get her into a and e.' The man with then rolex was left as tony was, for dead.

The world was spaghetti being eaten in Lady and the Tramp. One thing leading to another. Tony felt mushy on the isnee, but more his brain than his heart. He stumbled in.

The room had already been spinning, his perception a listless tilt as though his brain weer caught in mid shrug, and nio longer wished to be particularly attacehed to reality. The soles of his shoes were not attached to the lift-floor. There was a rustle as the pages of the book the cat had pinned open lifted and flapped, closing some, opening others. The cat itself did not appear to enjoy having its study interrupted, not, at leats, by the expression on its features. Therew as asound like wind passinga round the lift, whistling through its nches, until Tony noticed that it was louder, and came from his wife's screaming mouth. Other odours joined that of his vomit, dull sweat, a dale around the sharp crags of puke, the smell from his crotch that was one part wee, one sweat, and the other frfom the intimacy with he had shared with the woman who bobbed on the ceiling, her scream curling at its edegs, then ripping slowly inward, toward the centre of her full-stop mouth. Her lips rippled with the rip, her eyes widened as her mouth tightened,a dn Tony thought he could see a question within the hard, chocolaty exterior of fear. Why haven't we hit the bottom? If anything, this seemd to undermine her terror. Tio tear the floor right from under it. They hit. (arvand sphere nineteenth century lift level indicator?) Buzzzzzzzzzzz. The electrical iompulse of neurones getting together over this moment, fusing, agreing. Buzzzz. It wasn't what it was supposed to be. He wasn't dead. Buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. There should have been more of a to-do about he opening of his eyes. A dignitary, the cutting of a ribbon, a plaque, perhaps. The Buzz, he sees, is a fly, attracted, by the fell of its scampering, excited motions, by his head, where the needle had been. His forehead throbs and feel as if it might detach itself from the rest of his head, and make off with the fly, flying toward the hole in the ceiling. He might have qwonedered how the fly got, if he hadn't seen then hole in the ceiling, which was the kind of brown that made one think of holes in the ground, and had a rope pendulining from it. At the end of which, if Tony followed the parabola that was going ever more vertical, was tied a bottle contining liquid the colour of a shadows under trees at twilight. Tony could not help but think of the hum of bees, despite the fly. The bottle and the rope, given the narrowing parameters of its swings, must have recently fallen, not unlike him, thought Tony. With a croak from mouth his throat and his spine behind it, he turned his head, and saw Joanne who lay as he did, but as of a moment before, staring upward with a slack expression which said less deceased, more astonished. Tony looked to see what she saw, in case he had imagined the scene on first glimpse. He hadn't. He ha,d however, missed something, a lage note through the hole-punch of which a lilac length of strung tied it to the bottle. The noe said, clear even through the haze of the fly (which had now left his forehead and scampered to his eyebrow), 'This Will Take You Back' in calligraphy that would have made the sixteenth century proud. Joanne rose into his field of vision. How can she do that? he thought, It seemd an act as at odds as the lift's plummet through the earth's substrate, as vomit floating up his shins. He saw more flies and jojned th dot of them, turning his neck back to sideways. He saw, also, where they had coe from, most latterly. The body of a rabbit lay, its neck apparently broken by the impact that had failed even to bruis ehinm, or stop Joanne from satnding. The cat, ingnoring the insects, was taking out its spleen. Having done this, it batted it across the lifts floor, now longer shiny, but now crumbed with dirt, and smeared with rabbit blood, and splatterd by where the vomit finally found its rest. Which was everywhere, it appeared. He felt suick and realised some was on his hand. He put his other palm to his mouyth and bit the skin, hoping their was no puke there. He didn't taste any and thanked stars. It was beyond him to believe that he had any lucky ones. 'It smells of Christmas. My mum's perfume,' said his wife.

'Stop,' he said, rising to until hisn toso was upright. It felt numb., plastic, a dummy. His head was worse. 'Stop.' She ws nearing the top. She went into the hole. She didsappeared into darkness. There was no light up there, though it loked like a tunnel. Dirt time-glassed to the light's floor. After a mimute of thism her feet reappered and she lowered herself to her hiops, hanging from the centre of the lift's ceiliung, from the hole. She let go, he saw, a moment after she had, as she hit the floor, rlling tot eh side as she landed. She came to a rest in the rabbit's corpse. There was a scquek, as though it had wind in it still, and s creech from her and a hiss from the cat, who was not amused. Probably, thought Tony. 'You alright?' he asked. Sometiems it was hard to ignore the noceties. He was too mdlle clas, she always said. 'Yeah. Yuck.' She got up and bfrushe dher jumper off, wiping claw marks of blood across her abdomen. 'It's hot up there,' she added,a nd took off the top layer of her jumper, then the next, elaving only two t-shirts. NMow, Topny could tell how much she was sweating.She was right, whoever. It wasn't down to her exreryiokn s, alone. It was hot in here. A fact that hadc not been true for anywhere in Tony's existence for two weelkls, at elast. He wondered how he hadmn;t noticedm, then recalled the shoit leg, the tattoeed forehead, the plummet in the lift. He could give himself a break, he reckoned. Everyone lse had been trying to, it seemd. He ros ro stand next to her. The comparison, side by side, was disconcerting. The leg-injury had made him a good inch shorter, and the tattoo a bad posture even worse. He was diminished. 'I'm going to rink this,' she said. 'I think you have to, to get through the tunnel up theer.' 'You don't know what's in it. It's nto worth the risk,' Tony said. 'It si. I saw daylight up there, at the end of the tunnel. You know,' she turned to look at him. 'I think we're underneath a rabbit hole.' She seemd to be studying his face. I should be doing that to you, thought Tony. 'I saw a nature program. Can't remembegr what it's called. They built these warrens with a glass wall, and you could see every chamber. There's rabbit poo up there, look, look''' she pointed down herself. @i'cve still got some on my knee.' Tony looked. She spoke again, and his eyes went up to her lips. 'Buut I can't get up throught eh main entrance.' 'Why don't we,' byu this, he meant 'you', 'we don;'t we just dig through.' 'Yeah,' she nodded, but the motion got sidetracked by her thoughts and became a shake, 'no, it's hear for a reason' and she reached to the bottle, unstoppered it, and had it at her lips before Tony could say. 'Don't.' So he didn't. It jhadn';t been long since he wished her dead. The cat hd taken to the rabbit's heart, squeezing out what it had left t offer. She drank half and let the bottle go. It swung by its stem. Sje droped the stopper and it clattedee on the floor. It didn't distract the cat, which continued to play even as a dry sound came from Joanne's skin, lie that of leaves curling on an autumnbral floor. Her hair rose, her height fell. Tony no longer felt dimished. She had a brown bob and about three feet six inches, from the soles fo her feet to the bob's top. Her double d breast, even beyond the t-shirts, had been swallowed by the lips of her rib cage. Her face was angular, her liumbs a greyish brown and fragile, twiggish. She wore clown shoes that had been boots an momembt before, a nd trousers that wrinkled up like sloughed off skin. 'What are you, like eight?' Tony said, not noticing either that jer had done, so or after he had. She didn't reply but liofted her hands and stared at them when, Tony thought, she should be looking at her lack of tits. The Yorkshire cat looked uop btu didn't; seem to find anything of this particularly surprising and looekmd down at the rabbit once more, abd at what now appeared to be lungs. 'This takes you back,' whispered on,. He wanted to go back, to a time before all fo the mistakes he had made. To a time before Joanne. He reached out and drank, and shrank, as she had. The shrinking was nto painful but unsetllign,t eh physical equivalent of beinh inside one of the funny, bendy mirros at a circus, being the reflecetion more tha n the original. From the inside the sound was not that of desicatting leaves, but of wind across a plain, as singing is always better onm the inside. But, his leg was till there, when it had finished, and his jenas were several sizes too biug, it was til there, behind him. He raised a small hand with smaller fingers to his forehead, and they came away from the ridges", "label": 1}

H efelt he needede ot be. Ritehr seing this, or reporting fact, she nodded,a nd tunrd and grasped the rope and pulled hers elf upward. This seemed easier but, as he had been changing, she must hve shed all but her t shirt and moved ina way that suggested that she was no longer weighed by her life as an adult. He tried not to glance up between the gape of her clothing, athtne did, and wondered what this made him. Not excited. By the feel of it, he had little to be excited with. He took off his jeans and baggy socks and boxers,a nd jumpers, and buy the time he scaled the rope, usin hios good leg and two skinny arms, she was out of sight, wriggling up through the trabbit hole, visble only as cork to the light he saw, inglimpses,seepining in. Bright eyes glared at him from the lambent, uterine burrows to his sides, Tony's skin goosebumping as would a turkey's on the table. He couln't stop thinking about their teeth. They ' the eyes and the canine ' put him in mind of Watership Down, not of ', or ', or', but of the bad rabbits driven mad by roads and death and humans. THOUGH BURROWED WIDE BY his wife ' she can't be, she's too young to marry ' the tunnels contrict him, his chest, tight as lung's '. In an asthma attack. And there is s a stench in here, foetid, fecund, rank, and high, not of something that has crawled down here to die, but that couldn't, too overgrown to fit, and was wedged above, rotting down. He crawled toward this, but didn't. To the lLight. Sunlight. An aurora of it around Joanne. This drew him up, fish on its hook. The glint as of around a coin in ahoard. Golden. He would crawl into Hell to feel such heat, see such light. And up, slither up, up, wriggling. Gritted teeth, dirt fallig between them, sieving onto his tongue, the taste of honest effort, dirt making an archeological mureal of his tattoo. He blinked it from his eyes, throwing off the soil as he hadn't the fly. Joanne was gone, now, from his narrow, shocked 'o' if vision. There was Only sunshie wan and grey to his sight, but bright. He emerged into shadows cast by heaped ribcages of savanna grass, high as the bones fo a Brontesauroes, thick and bristling. He emerged into shade not direct sunlight but that was enough for Tony's eyes, and they began to cry. Nearby, he could hear his wife was similarly occupied. He walks to her and her and the sobbing hole in her face around which she was falliung apart. It was at tim3s like this, as h3e walked, that he knew he wasn't a sociopath,. Despite what she might say. The humidity made the walking like wading through heatedf mushy peas. His years up north had taught him that much, at least. It took several ehaves for her to realx against him, for her head to tilt to his shoulder as he smoothed her hair, working against the simplm,e brown bob as though ringing out the tears. With or without the weeping, they would have been wet. The temperatire suporated their pores and, sweat rising to the skin as moisture did from all around, drifting in dragon breaths from the curved heights of the svana grass. Tony wiped an arm along his forehead dn succeeded only in slickening it. He didn't drown any hairs he had tehron. He didn;'t have any hairs. It was ngoing to be hard to get used to his size. He kept running a tongue across teeth he knew would be baby, and thinking they felt as big as an adult's, before realiszing his tongue would hav shrunk with the rest of him. His t-shirt pooled around his lap like ' [flowers] about Ophelia. The sweating increasede. He felt he wass drowning in the air. Somehow, he missed te cold, Then, of course, knew he didn't. Joanne had stopped crying and was distancing herself with the staving of her spine, the striaghteing of her neck, taking her head from his shpulders, with a low moan of surprised terror. Tony turned to loom at her face, and twisted to stare along with hr eyes at the ant that entered the bowl of vegetagion. If they had shrunk, the ant had grown, and then some, becoming bigger than him,. Its head boobed in ther air as if sniffing and was th size and colour and opaqness of a basket ball. It's eyes were oblique and black as a shark's. It ddin't seem to have nay issues with standing, still, however, and sniffed toard Joanne and Tony, its' antenna whisking the air which semedd to congeal around it's head like a hllainaise. It's legs and body werew vaugule translucent in the way of sweets, thougnb these sweats were huge, and would have graced Willie; Wonmka's factory, Tony coulnd't help but think. It's going to kill us, he couldn't help but add. As Joanne had pullerfd back form him, he pushed her away. She fell compliantly, open legged, and supine ohe ground, her eyes the only part of her that was still on the move. Tony rose, his bad leg music-staved behind her, giving him the image of a karate-stance, and none of its stability. The ant lowered it's head. It's the [incer clackded togther infront of its maw, as though saracsticall clapping. Agony ant, thought Tony. He found it impossible, then, not to bgrin, and, directly after to giggle. The ant appeared to take against this, and rushed at him, in a csattrer of six limbs across compacted dirt, it';s head rising as would abulls", "label": 1}
{"text": "in any hemingway novel. Tony was thrown off his feet, and launched bck into the saber-curve of a a length of grass. Bouncing off it, he thought, they're as strong as they're suppooed to be, and crumpled to the earth. As Joanne moaned so did Tony, tasting soil. He cpughed to distract the ant as it capered toward his ex wife. Fluids were pulsing in its body, he saw, as he saw it in profile. Guts and heart were visible. Lungs? What was the term for an insect expert. He wasn't one, and didn't know. He push-upped hiosmefl vertical. 'Come on,' he whispered. He had meant to shout ' to distract the insect- but a whisper was the most his lungs would do. The any came anyway. As it closed Rony clapped to his left and dicved right, his hands holidng any imagimary red rag. Perhaps reacting to the sound, the ant went away from him and charged out from under the grsass and into the sunlight of the glade beyond. 'Run,' he said, to Joanne, before realising that his mouth had givcen up on even whsiopering. Joanne had stoo,d anyway, as though he were as psyhich as ant's were supposed to be, btu stood rooted to the soil. The ant was staggering as though Tony ahd jumped on his back. Instead of him, he could see, despite the glare of the sun across its abdomen causing sun spots across his vision, was a reedd lump. No, two lumps, three, like a granny ordering tea. Then more. Whereas before, its torso had throbbed translucently with the display of inetranl oirgans, now it was blubbering ' its skin broiling- with red, glistening lumps, like instanrt-cancxer gone crazy. That's some sunlight, thought Tony, and staggred hismefl, both metally, and with his feet. The ant had collapsed, now, as much into itself as to iuts chin and from its legs. Every thingw as a mulch, its form no longer even a body but a writhing mass of meta'.'s, jokeyting for positon, as though supping on its ine=sect flesh wasn a race, and to the victor the spoilt meat. Finally, hissing slightly, it was unrecognisiable from what iut ahd been, and Tony turned away, making the same noise as the ant's corpse with his lips. He bent and retched and nothing came forward. Who was he kidding? What would shock him now? 'What was that?' said Joanne. Tonmy lookd up past his eyebrows at her. She was standing. He thoguth of repeatin his joke, Agony ant. But, if anything, itw asn't an ant anymore. He shook his head as though to dislodge it ofnthe thought and then heard it, a call, likie that of a bugle floddoded with saliva. In his sight, Joanne tensed. Itew asn't the first that had happened. She looked vulberable, as a little girl, her limbs twigs that could be stood on. They stood still;, tony and Joanne, trying not to make a sound. There eas the noise, somewhere out int This Plac,e of foliage disturbed, feet onm the run. The horn sounded again, a hunt where the hunts man could not stop drooling. A child ran past, slightly shorter than Joanne, and the height of Tony. It's skin was a tek brown and shining with xsweat as though the wood had been varnished. It5s legs were a fairy blur. It, then, was gone. 'WTF,;' adsi Joanne, theabbreviation taking longert than the child to pass. There was something following it. The horn, again. 'Run.' This tim, it came out. As did, 'It's rambunsctious obvuious, in;t it master squires.' And, 'How oft must I's says 'Captin's. Captin's!' Followed bu, 'it's rambunctious obvious, in't masyter squires?' 'Captin's! Caoptin's!' 'It;'a rambunctious obvious, in't master s. I's is the Captin. I's the Captin!' Two voices, Tony could tell, befor either rounded the cross hatching's of grasss. But two voice of the dame dialect, the same slick accent, the identical burbling pronunciation,a s though fo trhe same, salivic throat. 'Gimme the horn, moron.' 'My name's ain't Ron, just as your name's ain't Pretty.' 'Pass yer arse around a whipple stick you puss-filled slapstick.' 'Slaptick my anal place!' The sound of a slap. A slap in reply. Slap, slap, slap. The sound and it's orgin round a frond of grass. They were close the two speakers. Joined at the hip wasn't half of it, but fixed, as well, by the throat and the scalp, and even, at the corners by the lips. They sahred one eye, with one of each of their which stared round the corner fo their joined face, and could have entered a three lkegged race without the aid of any string. The eye in the centre droopped, ;azy or simply exhausted. Everythign ws steched, moreover, as thought eh two forms were attempting to pull away from each other, at the same tiome as engaging in slapping the other's face. Then hands hung in mid blow, and in the thick air. 'It's a child. It's.' said one, the saliva of its ,mouth running into the other's, as tide between estauries. 'Tis. Likely a great prize, one think.' 'I think too.' 'So ye says, Seen no portenbts of it.' They were dressed ' ofr it was dressed 0- in livery of the number '2' in red on black, and sporting insigias of what seemd to be red cabbages, or florets, shapes that had the lookm of the ant in the hot, overhead sun. 'Split up,' shouted Tony. Joanne ran one eway. Tony ran the other. Behind him, he hearf the things say, 'Can't do.' 'Tried it.' 'Bled excessivle and fell aspleep in our own sick.' 'Bereaking uo just won;'t stick.' Before, mo9mentarilyy.' ASfetr him!' And 'after her!'

{"text": "turn. As I run, arms out and hands flat and tilting like the flaps on an aerop;lnaes wing, it throws up roots to trip me. In ths ahdowed, dried-out gullies the corpses of brooks are thin mud traps. The earth seems to have crawled in to the darker spots under the tall grass and hunkers there, unsen, and ready to stub my toes, take me off my feet. But none of these compare with the sunlight. The memory of the giant ant bubbles up in my mind as its skin did in the open. Here and theer are triangle of sunlight, lazoringh down from the canopy above. Nothing lives I n these. Even the dirt looks like it wants to move out. As tith infrared tripwies,I don't dare to cross into the light. Somewhere behind are the pureurs. Two or one, itw ass hard to tell. The bugle sound, mucusy as a flooding lung, and I pass into a cooler, deeper dark beneath what is no loinger savanna grassa dn are high, thicket choked trees. I ave always run as a footballer should not play, head down, eyes just before my feet. Now, I stop before I fall, and only slip on an ochre, toxic-hued puddle of fallen, rotting seeds. They are bright orange and have the loomk of bitter pills, each, or sweeitie sin foreign airports from years ago, when my mother would say, 'no, they'll rot your teeth'. These just rotted into themselves. If I were to guess, I would would say Laburnum, but I'm not a dendrologist, and there is something Otherwordlyt about the trees in here. I look up. The canopy is a sharp rockface of silhouette, beyond which the sky is pure white, a flash, the wink of an atom bomb. Here and there, the sun gets through,. Inone such place, a corpse decomposes. It maqy have been a rabbit. It was twice the size and more than half-tumour. I have stopped running, I realise. This wood is silent. No bird calls, which deosn't surprise me, given what happens up there, in the sky. The sound of my breathing is heavya dn nto falling behind me. I start, again, but not for more than a stride. A figure peels off the bark of a nearbvy tree, silent as peeling a banana, its skin tanned as wood. It is dressed in nothing. It's a boy. Adding to his camouflage, he carries a branch, a crude weapon that has been sharpened to such an extent, the tip of it pierces my imagination. I can't help but think of it skewering, a splinter thatw ouldn't come out easily, at elas not with on e of my organs. I gulp. Further down, my body shivers as the point of the wooden spear clses on my stomach. My heaert strikes midnight. My abdomen is flatter down there than it has been for a long time; I long, momenmntarily for the fat. Anything t put between m,y entrails and this boy weapon. He has a look in his eyes that says he's seen enough of death to feel comfortable shaking hands with my blood. His eyes are darker than the wood. Slowly, he raises a finger to his lips. I gulp agin, this tiome in hope. Svage as his hair looks, the way his penis does not seem to care that it just hangs there, his shushing quietns the beat-beat in my ribs. He is shorter than me by the height of his hair, which seems to be about a foot. He look beyond me. Sniffs as though listening with his nostrils, and then splays fingers out aroudnn the shusing fingers and beckons with the whole of his hand. Follow, he seems to say. I try, but my legs have taken this moment to join in with my lungs and choke. He closes, leans in, drawing a semi circle on the flat of my belly with the spear he cariies. I expect him to be close enough to kiss, then lunge, skewer me, but instead, he whispers, 'Listen, I klnow you're not used to This Place, but it really is not the best of ideas to simply stand here. If the two of tumours takes you, you'll end up at the table of thw Candy Kinbg, and not as one of his esteemed guests, if you know what I mean.' I have watched Made in Chelsea, and his voice reminds me of the children, there. Not so much as if he speaks around a plum, as around a punnet. 'O'K'' I mouth, as little of it escaes onto the congeale air of the wood. 'Right O,' he says, and gently takes my hand and forcibly tugs it and I follow. Joanne was gone, as an uncoordinated rush of running trough the burush. Tony had always found it funny, the way she ran, head tilted forward as thiugh to long a stride might jolt it off, long legs loping as if the world were made of ste;pping stonmes, arms outstretched, palms upward, weighing, perheaps, if any normal person would run this way. Itw assn't funny, she had told him. Why do you always make me gfeel bad about how I look? She had asked. It wasn't funny. The creatue turned their sharedca nd individual eyes on him and Tony ran. But his lame leg was his own Siamese twin (his nicked forehead a nigglinglittle sister, the tattoo an embarssing parent he couldn't shake at the school gates) and he stumbled into a tree. 'Har, har,' said oe of the mouths. 'hee, hee,' agreed the other. Tony was beyond the bough., now, but moving slowly. 'Coem on, conmeon, come on, ' Tony's breath was hot and fast, outdistancing him. 'Let's get him,' the two mouth cried, as one, particularly where they met. The creature coud be heard pounding across the ground, a bad rhythm, a vibe gone awry. A drummer having a seizure. Tony wheezed under trhe long grass, avoiding the whip-lines whereh", "label": 1}
{"text": "the sunlight fell through. The creature was at the tree, behind him. 'This way,' itg said. 'No, this way.' It hit the trunk. Tony heard the crack, followed by a sandy thud. He guessed the creature had fallen backwards. A scramble,as it rose. Tony stumbled down the lee if a sandbank, around ahole in it bluff the size of a shield. He crouched under it lip. Momentarily, the creature approached, mumbling to itself like an unanswered ringtone. 'Always go right. When you have a choice always go right. Everybody knows that.' 'What's wrong with left.' 'It's just not right, is it?' 'Which way you reckons he went?' 'Blwo the horn, fellow.' 'Nab. The kIng wikll be rancid with anger if we send this here hunt the wrong way. Dripping.' 'Nice, pretty little red fox, though ain;t he, right up to the top.' The slapping sound of lips being licked. 'Yep, yep, indeed, the King will just lick him up, lap him down. Yey.' 'Hey, stop licking my lips, you noisome, foulmost beast.' The slapping became that of palms. Theyw er above Tony. He could smell the cfreatures. Merdicianl as a lepers swimming pool. Chrloine on dioseased skin. And, when they laughed or cried out, the end of a whiff of rott. Slimy, thought Ton, before realisng the slime ws on hs own back. 'Bloody stones,' said a voice behind him. Tony jumped out of the hole. 'Oh, I'm sorry,' said a worm as the a\\nt's body in the direct sun. 'Thought you wrre a stone. They soemtiems faqll intot eh end of my holes.' Tony grappled frantically at his back. His fingers came away slicked, wet, smelling of mactated dirt. His cheeks must have been spanked back in shock, his lips following them in aconvoy of disgust, becauser the worm added, 'No need to lok like that. I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned.' 'What?' hissed Tony. Coming out in the high-pitch of an eight year old, he sounded embittedec beyond his years. 'WHAT?' 'Got you,' said the creature above him. 'What he said,' said its twin, pointing ;lattereally. Tony rab, lunging forward as much to evade his own back than anything that followed him. 'How rude.' The worm could be heard to mutter, 'Huamns today! No manners!' 'Shut it, now, you worm,' said one of the worms. The other seemd to breathe for them both, as it broke open its gait, an dstridedd into arun. 'Yes? And? Is that supposed to be an insult?' The worm's reply faded to a rumble, then into the distance, as Tony ran from the savanna grass ansd into a fo aforest thatw a ddark and depp, already, eher at its edge. He kept going intot he dark, driven on by his relenetkless heart. 'Oh, look how he runs.' The creature shouted, 'Fast as a wet fart.' 'Can't see him. Too dark.' Itw as and it wasn't. In places, flashing kaleidoscope before his reeling eyes, Tony saw shapes where the sunlight had macheted throuyght the dense canopy above. Bright diamons, coal-faggot quadterlatals, and all sort of triangles; sizzling isocles that put Tony in mind of sausages on the barbecue, sharp-edged scalenes. Falring his lungs breathed so fast one breath met the other on its way in. He stumbled, btu avoided all of the places thatw ere lit. Ran straight into the dark. A dark so pitch, he quickly became unsure if he had ot had not closed his eyes,a nd reache up to check the eyelids. So dark, momentarily, he couldn't find them. By luck and occasional, shin barking judgement, he ran between and qartound trees until the voices of the creature ws left far behind. Then, abruptly, he ran into nothing. Normally, he liked running into nothing. Unlike something, it didn't bloody the nose. Now, he had the sense of falling, the feeling there wasn nothing beneathn his feet, and he hit the ground below befor even his brain had said, There's no ground. A wet heat slugged into his left eye. He reached up. In the dark he felt blood. He had felt enpugh of his own, recently, to recognise it as such. From his temple he felt, also, what seemd to be horn. Long and shorn from wood. He was stood straight, propped between a series of wooden spikes. Nicked again,he thought, bitter as the blood that was now reaching lips fatter than he remembered them being. Having little choice but to be sttod up, eh passed out, falling into unconsoipus. Light. Dark. Light. Tony winced and his forehead regtretted it. He shouldn't have been used to these changes in the lighting. By now, after all. Dark. 'Limp' Fatherfucking' dick,' said a voice from above. It's tonme was broken until it seemed coiled into its self, but high, and somehow feminine, ansd somewhat pink. Light. Tony tried to shy away from it, but was pinned, as much as a stavened butterfly. He felt morfe like a moth, even though the light was doing nothing for him. He rose his hand, sieved the rays between his fingers, stared. Above, head shrouded in an antihalo of dark, was what seemd to be alittle old lady, bowed and shrunken at the lip of the hole into which he had fallen. The little old lady worked at the torch in her hand. 'Stupid, little pirkc.' The liught held. 'Where am I?' asked Tony. The question b;lurted out like a frog's ribbit ' in a croak. 'By the witch'' said the old lady, by way of reply. Momentarily, Tony realised she wasn't replying. '' you're a human.' The was adry, snake-like rustle and a length of rope fell into the hole, flapping against Tony's head. 'Here.' Tony grasped at it. Tne rope prickled his palm. 'Can't pull myself upm' mumbled Tony to himse;f, without even trying to do so, into the darkness of the pit. It seemed to sut his self-pity. 'I can pull you up,' she said. 'You're too small,' Tony said to the shadows. But", "label": 1}

He's pinned to Joanne's hip. There's a slighter, but more integral thump of Joanne's head on the wheel. Glass makes a bee-line into the CX's cab, or several beelines, swarming. Bang, says the outside of Tony's heas, as it connects with the opposing window. Rip. Spark. They go through a fence. Electric? Tony thinks. Bang, answers his head on the window, and for the secomd time that day there's a black out. This time it's him. He opens his eyes and realises they are already open. The world swims, has, infact, gone night swimming. There's a palpable fear that he is drowning in this new dark. He can taste it - his panic - a sharp, chlorinated tang. The world ripples around him, refracting spillages of light, oil stains of light, bleared headlights. Most of the rest of his view is redacted.Yes [redacted]. It takes some time for Tony to ralise the readction isn't the dark [redacted] but him, his brain, holes in his ['percception' edacted] He clenches his fuists and ['jawline' redated] and tries to pull himself and his vision back [redacted]. There are voices in his head, several of ['them' redacted], and they all sound like him. Voices: Tony 1: Concussion is like being drunk. Tony 2: What's so bad about being drunk? Tony 1: Just ask the water. Tony 3: But the world swam. You can't be like water as well! Tony 1: That's from Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy. Tony 3: Yes, that's water swimming in the world which is swimming in water. Tony 2: There'll be no hitchhiking. Look at that motorway! Tony 1: I can't. It's dark - except for the explosions. Tony 3: Talk about mixing metaphors. Tony 1: I'm concussed. Tony 4: That's not a mixed metaphor, water and water isn't a mix, not unless the sea's a cocktail. Tony 3: YOU'RE A COCK' Explosion. Then another ['explosion' redacted] It exoriactes the voices, cutting off Tony 3 just in time. Tony 3 was beginning to sound like his wife. Tony winces, more from the flames than the voices. Under his ['hands' recated] , the hard shoulder lived up to its name, a contusion of small stones and pains at the top of his arm and ['down his arm' recated], on his cheek. It takes him a further minute to wonder how he has stumbled up onto the hardc shoiulder, but he guesses this is what concussed people do, before thinking of his wife. 'Joanne,' he says, and runs. Neither verb works. The word comes as a croak, and he falls over. The ground smells and feels of summer. Tne scent of growth in heat, rampant germination. The feel of springy turf filled as much with hope as nutroesnts from the sun, the crawl of life that cannot be seen, seeds yet to unfurl. Tony can't squash the image of his wife dead in the cab of the CX, eyes vacant as the sky above. 'Not true,' he says, on one of his many falling downs. 'The stars are out.' Not many clouds tonight, he decides. It's not night, he adds. And, I'm bleeding. He holds a palm to his cheek. When he brings it away, there's a line of blood along the index finger to an ink-blot on his palm. Under the motorway lights, it is a silvered pitch, saltpetre-ish. The white CX is black, the flushed headlights turned away, abashed, but the engine's still turning over, with its thready hack-click-hack. He walks and trips. The turf is a frown of uneven moor, furrowed, disbelieving. Tony can see her, the skin of her forehead first. He reaches the driver's window. This side of the CX smells of metal recently wounded. Fresh, sharp, acrid. The door handle is cracked in two. As he tugs, the half he holds snaps free and sits in his palm like a cheap knuckle-duster. He shakes his head to clear it but welts out another slug of blood onto his temple. It itches. Joanne is bent to the window, skin willow silver where the lights of the motorway reach it. Mostly, they don't. 'Are you okay?' he asks. She ignores him, and he reapeats the question, adding. 'We should get a safe distance away, just in case.' and, 'Yes, yes, okay.' Tony nods and walks around the car, to the passenger side. He shivers. The truck is stuck in the mud beyond the CX, wheels spinning, cab-speakers playing Stealers Wheel. Beyond its cab-lights is nothing, a space black and alien. Out there, in the pitch, he thinks he can hear a horn. A bugle. His shiver becomes a decisive shake of the head. The truck's headlights aren't on. Tony opens the CX door, and bends, slithering over the upholstery to his wife. She doesn't withdraw from him and, by this, he knows she's unconscious. He puts a finger under her nose and holds it there until he can feel her breathing. It's weak but it's there, he decides. Sliding his hand between the front seats his fingers clip the seat belt holder and return to it. Unclipping the belt, he tries to pull her to him, can't (she's always been heavier than him, even before the weight gain of their marriage) and slides foward until he squats over the gear-stick. From there, he worms his fingers under her buttocks. Ignoring the memories of their last time, he pulls her across the upholstery. She's on his side, now, and he lowers his feet to the moor, grappling her arm around his shoulder, leaning her against his torso. Sweating, he faces the lighst of the motorway. On it, a car explodes, and the moor's heather hisses and rattles delicately. The sound makes him think of adders, and he starts walking. [redact] an animal fence, its", "label": 1}

'Old on tight,m' she said, and Tony did. The pull came all at once, but Tony saw it in stages, from the side ' in his mind ' as in three panels of a comic. A Marvel. The first; the pull. Then, him sailing over the head of alittle,old lady. The third of his crashing, scalp-long into the tree beyond, with a sound bubble. Clunk. He looked up from his new positon, an d thought, it isn't new at al ;I'm prone to being proine. (He giggled internally, and it worried him as would bleeding.) Anaemic, rust coloured dust sounkled down onto his cheeks. If there was anything fairy about it, is was the scatteringa nyphs ashes. He sneezed. 'Bless you' Sorry,' said the old lady. She extenbded a hand. My what long nauils you have, thought Tony. He got his feet (or, atlezst, his right foot) on his own, without her aid. He kenw what a pull from this dowager would do. First hand, he thought. 'Well,' the torch flickered. The little old lady thwacked it aganst a trunk. The plastic and the wood creaked, and Tony winced on their behalf. 'Dratted thing,' she said. She turned to him. The torch light ewas back, thought listless and confusedf, like an old, hen pecked husband. Tony's caught the contiours of a face beneath the cawl. He didn';t breathe. Abruptly, he felt his age; about eight, and rembered the little, old lady was just as big as him. My what a snub nose you have. My what piggy eyes. 'Follow me,' said the little, old lady, and tuend into the wood, and awalked between the trees, singing, 'Ho hum,. Ho Hum, They sing when you're up their bum. Ho hum.' Tony stared after her shawled back. As it dwinled, he followed, but not the little old lady. He followed the light. He had been too long without the light. Unbenmknowst to hi, on the other side of the tree he had hit, there was a word carved in the wood, with a heart, not a dot, above the 'I'. 'Aimee,' it said, faded in dessicated, like a message written in eth sand. The little old lady before him, witht eh torchlight before her, appeared as vague, as discoursed by watery bubbles, as a sweet dropped in coc cola. Tony kept his gaze on her shift and not on his feet and often stumbled. She led him on deep into the darkness of the wood. Tony had walked through copsese, previpously, and forests, and woods, but this was denser than even the latter; a p;lace where trees went home, he thought. His thoughts bubbled as did the (Granny) in his sight (My what anuimal parts you have) and snagged as did his toes on the feet of the great trees in this deep forest (don't you, granny, dear?). It took him some tiem and severak leagues of walking to realise he was properly concussed, and a few footsteps to forget this. The trees did not so much loom about him as he shrank, more so even than on the draught in the lift, until he were a motre, a willo the wisp, lost forever in the forest. He was essaying into the mist of his own concussuoon, the darkness inked and became palpable as clouds. It was as through stormfront at dawn, that the light peered through. Pink. It mafde an obelisk of the little old lady's form. Barred the trees. The pink fell on him, and lit hiom upm, clearing the cobwebs from his consciousness. Tony blinked, and missed the colour., He didn't blinm for some tiem. He was becoming aware of figures sat where the tree branches happened to right-angle. Children, some carrying spears. He ignored them. Only the colour appealed to him, ringing out across his skin like a bell calling him to soemthign holy, a power beyond. He walked into a clearing and didn't realise ' didn't look up to see ' that it wasn't but that te trees here had lofted up therir branche,s their canopies, their ancient, wrinkled, fgossamer leaves in praise, a haleluyah of flora. Tony had no eyes for these. On the floor, amid dirt was a flower, pink and bunched as a heart on a stem. A rose. It beart out light. Beat. Tony had never been one for gardening. To hiom, it had always been the art of giving up, retreating from pintful endeavour. Gardening leave, they called it. The hobbyr of the craked, or the retired, or the boring; synomonous with allotments. Beat. But this rose ws no gardening. Nothing could have cultivated thius, not even amother nature. The waves of pink light fortified the air; waterd the small, desicttade incubi inside that Tony may as wll have called his inner child. Balm didn't go far enough. This encased him from skin to guts to the marrow of his bones. Beat. He felt, as though drinking at the Entwash, himself growing, his elg untwisting. He bathed. Beat. Bathed in it. Staring downward, he saw rthe petal hummed delicately at each other, as though housing bees. Between the folds, down from where they touched 'just- was protected darkness that had the look of somewhere sacrosanct. Tony felt his sight falling into it, his head tipping as though a beakr pouring himself in. Beat. 'Like a fuck for the eyes, ai'nt it?' A voice said from beside him, amd Tony blinked for the second time, his sight coming back to him. He found it hard not to snarl as he turned his head. He was not alomne, of course, but neither was the speaker. Young Joanne stood beside him, t-shirt soiled in the long tyre tracks of her fingers, from whete she must have rubbed it. DShe", "label": 1}

'Those petals, the way they curl and press against each other, Best description for the multi-verse I have ever seen.' 'You're a pig arren't you?' said Tony. 'The touching places are the gateways. Normally, teddy bears, believ it or not, the bears don't' particularly care. I'm used to gateways, I can tell you. Pot for instance, that was a gateway.' The figure turned to look at Tony. It's little piggy eyes. It's piggy snout. It's pigyy everything. 'Piglet. Not pig. Never pig, but that's one fo the peculararities of tThis Place. Just ask the childrrn.' It cast its chin back a degree, but Tony didn't need to look, he felt their precsne, and their spears, prickling at his back. 'Gateway to what?' 'The Blood of the poppy. This Place. So many petals, so many ways through.' 'It's so beautiful,' said oanne. Her large eyes were liquid, her pale skin cotton to soak them up. The beauty of the rose was reflected in both, and reminded Tony why he loved her. Had loved her. His heart felt as if it was on its own stem, drifting, as the pmast in Invasion fo the Bodysnatchers toward his wife. 'I'm sory,' said Tony, Neither of them seemd to hear him, the rose was thrumming, playing a note which may have been the chord that began te universe, ad was simply swelling, like an orchestra forever set to passinata. Despiet the light, the piglet's skin was wrinkled, an peach that had gone from flush to unripe to rotten. He had the loom of a woman who had grown uo pretty, before the meth addiction. Tony didn't ewant to see its teeth. Far off, discordant as an instrument dropped, vlattering in the pit, was the sound of a horn. 'The hunt is on, today,' said the piglet. 'You should sleep. We will, have to led them away from the Rose in the Wood, but they are not close enough yet.' As a child, Tony would steele onto his knees, ball his head ninto his hands, place his forehead to the carpet a,d, lie a Muslim set in motion the wrong way, rock- from side-to-side. It didn't need to be acarp[et, the bare floor would suffice, or, and this way was his favourite, denned in the duvet on his bed. The compos, softness of the forest floor ' the trees, even, seemd infused and softened by the pinkness of the rose ' blanketed him and , unable to explain his actions, he did the same. Fotal, a babe in Newton's Cradle, set to rock sideways. In this posiotn, in this place, somehow his body felt like it had gone home. Finally, he allowed the motion to carry him, hips and ribs first, to the forest floor, and stared at the shadow his silhouette made as the rose pulsed at his back. He felt rather than saw the curving trees through the corners of his eyesz, in the enveloping bower about him. He was about to allow the darkness of the trees into him, and to sleep, when he heard the approach of Joann, her thin, awkward limbs settling beside him, as a ne wborn deer behind its mother. He reached out an arm and, with it, his hand. Perhaps it was the mind he had now, reduced to a childlike snse of ease and instinct, but she had the same thoughtn, and did the same, their fingers intertwining; twins safe together in the soft,w arm twilight. Beat, went the rose, and Tony could feel the pulse of his wife's veins against his wrist, as everything came together in the loamy darkness of sleep. It totok afew moments of starin at his mother, to realise he was awake. Her curld brown hair hung around his head, er afce so close to his own face he initially thoguth she wss inside it. Curled brown hair. The grey bib, sewn with leaves as gold on afaberge egg, was gonbe. At her crown , se was as she had been ib her prime, in the yearsof his childhood. I'm not dreaming. The thought was a mental pinch but it didn't rouse him. She had taken his hand from his wife's and did what he couldn't. shaking it as she would nuts nto carrot cake, pulling himup. Tony recalled his hand in the bowl,m the ytaste of icing, the crtacked creaming of it under his cycling fingers, thick with promise. He was walking, tugged behind her, in the nighttime wake of her hair, between the trees. Onward and away from the light, like passing from an amethyst into the cave in which it hung. Tony found ti impossible not to gasp, but let her draw him on, feeling, still, econd to everything, including himself, She was his mother, after all. She's mum? There would have been room for doubt but for the shrunken size of his head, his child-sized ears, and the same could be said of the brain between them. The trees played bulldog with him, catching at his t-shirt, roots tripping his feet a she passed. Theys eemd- despite the lack of a breeze in the depp of the forest ' to be on the move. Her dark hair made her hard to see. Now, all he ad was her fingers; now he had left the cardiac-beating light of the rose behind. He held onto her fingers, but they were beginning to grind, to gnaw at him like toothless gums, as doubt had begun to, despite his underdevoped mind. She had stopped walking, but not the grinding, which increased, straining his knuckles. He shuddered, and flinched, before realisiin the insects that had landed on his temples was her hair; the soft, pulpy heat on his earlobe her breath. And, above this, her voice, enunciating clearly as she had when telling him, 'wat'ter,' not 'wat-ah'. She said, 'You are not the", "label": 1}
{"text": "one.' Her other hand fixed quickly to his other shoulder, the claw as desperate as that of a cornered rat. He trie to sink down, to go foetal on the ground (perhapsm to rock) but she held him and he could not. There was the soft, sibilant sound of skin spiliting. It came form somehwre up her ears. Her scalp, he thought, and deep as her skull. Pointy-head. Dunce-cap-skull. Tony had seen it befor,e in the hospital ward. And with it would come the the bleeding eyes, the blood-red rent of screaming lips, and the bleeding, bloody horrific noise. There itw as; a keen that made a wind tunnel of his head, his cheeks riplling, it seemd, as they insticncely chose flight. The scream was, impossibly, composed of words, and those words ordered into rhythm, 'The Candy King is coming, He's bored of sailing the Big Sea, The Candy King is hunting, He's cancer, can't you see?' It really shouldn't be a song, Tony couldn't help but think, Banshee would have thought it ugly. this flick of sarcasm all he had with which toi protect bhimself. Sarcasm, as his teenage years had known, was thw orst form of wit, and no better a defense. She was gone, along with tehn wail. The forest echoed silence. Tony coll[ased to his knees which were not grateful for the impact. He sighed, instead of sceamed. There had been far too much of this already, and sighed again when he realised he ws lost in the dark. The rees were talking to themselves, he thought. Hew a righ and wrong, he discovered. Perhaps because the trees were moving, he found himself close enough to one to bend his ear to its bnough. The bark was a mild rebute on his skin. Inside it, he could hear it whispering to itself, in a made up language, like that of apatient in an inpatitent ward, driven madder by its situation. The darkness was complete and and in more wasys than Tony felt, himself. The holes in him fel;t conspicuous, as tough the pitch air were filling them. The hum of the trees, like bad electricity, through his ears, the pitch through his and, as though fisted, down his mouth. He felt sick, and unable to breathe, trtying too hard against the pillow of it. He sank to his haunches, scrabbd at the earth, lifted it to his face, attgempting to see something that may at least be brown. And culdn't, and felt it against his eyesballs. He moaned, and screamed and scrabbel at the eyes, and liked the sound of hims elf, and treid to scream again bu7t couldn't. then darkness was keeping it down. He shrank still,ma d more so than the size hehad been before, even more than AS A SIX YEAR OLD. The nigfht terror5s were back, but there was no night-light to eb left on, or bedrrom door ajar to the landing, the shaft of it across the all at the head above his bed, o the board.His eyes were weeping and wioth more than the irritation of the grit, what was inside might as well have been seeping out of him through these ducts, forced by the over occuptation ogf the endless night., Itrw as getting mighty crowded in his head, what with all the fear, and the so9unds of the forest. The snaking hiss of tree roots moving therough soil, coming t get hum, and worse things, thikngs that were joined at the hip and the motuyha nd wished o be joined with him, by the teeth, and by theatin g. asd ba man he had always been on the short sid,e hencxe all the wiritng, but he haD FORGOTTENM WHAT IT WAS TO BE TRULY SMALL. THE WILD REMINEDE HIM, and then, amist, the shifyting of the forsrt, the mewling of his thoygyst, he heard the sinbging. It was soift, liltingso much it might just fall over, the sound of someone who had lost someone close and would bubble into song, instead of tears, at odd times ' in the shower, cooking ' without knwoign quite why. 'Somethere over the rainbviow ' went the song [add Amy at the end, in the garden] Through the remnant of the dirt, he saw dots of lilac light. Like punctuation from Yet's '[]', like twilight getting its act together and gathering. It gathered into the form of a little girl with a lilac dress who was dancing. In a heavier manner tah that of the lilac full soitps and commas, Tony pulled himsefrl together and rose and followed her. Light was not something he was goignto pass up, nor let pass him by. Opportuiniy dots, he thought, his mind still on kilter. E walked as though ina stiff breeze that didn't exist, bent to the righr, but he walked, and, soon, eh could see the dim haxze of pink, like that of asun thiknign about rising, but couldn';t yet be bothered. If he hadn't been doing so already, the sight would hav e made him cry. A shape passsedc by him. Tony turned. Joanne, eyesz closed, legs and arms stiff, but the former moving a jagged, Minty python walk, the latter still at her side. The Minisitry of Funny Sleep walking. It reminedev him of her at the end of their relationship. 'Never sleep walked in my life,' she had ssaid, 'except whn I walked into the registry office and marriage with you. I'll tell you what, though, I'll be running out of this shit, though. My eyes are finally wide open to what you are, you arsehole.' Her eyes weren't wide opne rioght now. Tony looked back toward the pink. The lilac dressed girl was gone, whoch didn't surprise him, somehow, as it wouldn't if he found out the fairy phtos were fakd, and wilo wisps diodn't really exist. It would be hard. Hwoever, to walk away from the pink. He couldn't leave her like this, unheeding of the dark, striding", "label": 1}
{"text": "into it. No matter how funny the walk, there was an intelligence out there didn't know human humour, and only knew the taste fo a human's seweta, their blood, their gunge, their cholic. Tony didn't know how he knew, this bbut he did and eather wished he didn't. He followed his ex wife. Eyes wide open, he thought. And brain stupid. It was hards. Even with the pallour of her skin, she was a ligthter charcoal than the coal-pitch of the forest, and quickly subsumed within it, as though it hard simply rubbed her out, blended her in. He hurriede and triopped, and hurried, again, and tripped more. Then, another light. The flickering, coca cola, off gold of the Piglet's torch. The colour was of raked up autumnbral leaves, golden. So much so it made Tony think of a New Hampshire fall, the microcosm of every tourist brochure and aryticle. Like most places, He had never been there. Like most writers, he had travlled extesively, in his mind. He was like the antagonist in the Wtefboys Song, the Whole fo The moon', but for the fact that he only imagined it all, and, no doubt, inaccurtal;ey. Itw asdn't aonly a money thing, Tony reckoned. He was at heart timid as a shrew. As his feet scucced like small clopuds across the soil, disconnectedm portending nothing, he noticed for the first time that nothing in the forest seemd to be dfoing any falling. Neither the levaes nor the temperature which remained at the height of summer, even in the innards of the wood. He swaeted as he walake,d and not All of it was fear. He wss the only on who felt like keeling over, but tahtw as probably the lack fo sleep talking. This wasn't. 'Blood of the poppy. Spoon full of suigar for m. Bloody the poppy into mine. Sugar in a spoon,' said a voice rising and cracking like thre piuzza boy in The Simpons, thought Tony. Tony couldn't see the speaker, hidden as itw as behind the silhouette of his wife. It was, he knew, the poiglet. Bfeore the torchlight and small fire, the edges of which played at the shadow fo her heels, Joanne seemd a Guy on a pyre. She twied on her feet slightly. She hd always been a convenient scapegoat, ir so she had always said, for his lackof success. Joanne idn't answer the small pig, azand iyt didn't seem to need her to. He was talking through, her but not to Tony. 'Blood and suagr, poppy and me.' Tony saw shadows moving between her legs, like a propleller staryting, and as he skirted her right arm ' and took it and drew her back from the fire ' he realised the piglet was ravelling his own arm, and a tourniquet around it. As Tony watched, the pig passed atrotter across his forearm, piokinga nd then his nose, truflleing, it seemed for a vein. At last the snuffling sound became mucusyd with glee. The piglet too as spoon was which was resting ona spit over asmall fire and pushed a needle into it. The liquid in itw as a broiling, vapourous white, like liquidified, ngry ghost. And wouldn't they be angry? Thought Tony. The needle took it and thence, by a clinical-quick actionw as transferred to the vein the piglet had hunted out in the wrinkled pallour of his skin. There seemd , at elst by this light ot be very little pin k left. The piglet rocked back onto his back and allowed the spoon and the needle to fall. It's point carve and exclamation mark intot h soi;, made to lookm deeper and more shocked by the angle of the fire. 'Oh, by Eeyore's tail, that pins the fucking spot. Oh, Wicth, yes, if you, any of youw ere still eher, you'df think this better tan sex, and wer all know what sluts youw ere. Mmm hmmm,' The piglket's rambling had taken off, in contrast with its body, which seemd staved to the dirt, clawed by ectasy. The piug shivered in its grip. Its eyes were big and black aenoguhto make Tony think of their surroundings. The puippils seed to go on forever, much as the poiglet's talking did. 'Forst there was that girl. Wjhat did they call her, oh, yes, indeedy, Aimme, and she killed the wicked witch of the north. Why what an ingenous youing lady, Not the witch, you see, but the Aimmee. Then the Candy ing came and what do you know you killed rhe witch's bitch-sisters, of the South, of the East, and the West, and even that thieving runt, North by North West.

Or perhaps they ddin';t, itw as difficult to tekll without the white or the ireses. 'You come intot he light.' The piglet gestured, then arced back to mon into the air, and press it shoulder blades into the ground. Nonetheless Tony walked forward ;etting Joann'e hand fall. There was slap, and she stirred , her eyelids fluttering openinga sthoughthe slap had been from him afainst her check,a and not self-admisiterd to the thigh. She moaned, but the piglet moaned louder, eclipsing her. 'Clooooser. Ther are so many gateways in these parts, in This Place, and I've been through afew. Mind you, the gateway I chose ' the skunk- is behind me and closed, I'm through it no, into te blood of the poppy.", "label": 1}
{"text": "You shoudlmnsee how big the poppies grow these days, it's like slaughtering a bear. Bend closer.'

He felt the f=blaze aginst his eyes, the spasm of heat in hsib eyebrows. He wandered if they wre blackening, carttonish. 'I see thin gs, with these eyes, in the blck of the forest,a awy from the pink.i see things. I canm tell you., I can tell you. I can tell you the one bearing the devil will kill the Candy King. That's what we're waiting for,. All us cast-aside boys. All us addicts.' EWit this, the pigket reared, until it stood as though susopeneded by strings, on the ends f its trotters. It grasped Tony's face between his trotters. 'Where am I?' Tony heard Joanne moan. 'Why am I moan?' 'No'' Hissed the piglet. 'Not you.' H elet go, and, fell back aginst the eartj, causing tony to wince. @yoyu're not the one.' Tony's wince stuck, as though there was wind down here, and it had changed. 'She said that,' ehs aid. 'My mum.' 'Yes.' Th e piglet nodded. It hugged itself. 'The queen of tumoiurs.' 'The queen of tunmours?' He had to ask. He hated ti whn people didn't ask. 'Your mother.' [the horns, the horns' more of the hunt] The hair stood up on Tony's neck, pulling the skin with it, into goosebumps. that felt as big as goose eggs. They coiuldn't be, of course, but then the hunters couldn't be as big nor as liquid as they sounded, on the otrher side of liens of bushes, or banks of drioed-out gullies. Neither could they be as mutated, could they? There ws only so much wrong that could be allowed to survive, surely, without rupturing an aretry, oror 2aqndering so far off the path of Nature that they lay down and died. Tony hid where he was told to, and ran at a point from the Lost Children, trying to be as silent as their feet. He hid, now, beneath the claw fo a large laburnum tree. He crouched in fallen, ochre, oranhge pods, like the bitter tears of atree thatw a sabout to die and really felt it ahdn;'t done enough with its life. Tony knew how it felt, or he would have, done, could he feel anything but fear. His calves ached, as did his knees and, just for good measure, his hip joints joined in. He didn't dare sit down. The Lost Children would point again, with their fingers or the hewn-ended sticks they carried, and they would run once more. The time after the Piglket had been spent in the glow of the rose, waking and sleeping like passing from one amethyst into another. But then they ' the whole trope- had moved on. They wnted to lure the hunt from the rose. They were bait. Tony tried not to breathe. He wriggled but could not yet move. Bait, his mind agreed. He wondeed if another worm would come up from, behind and beneath him, and give away his position, and hoped not, then hoped so. His fear was drawn longer than the spears the Chidlren carried, btu was sharp at both ends. His head was becoming thck with thtoughst, like ants over sugar. He thought of the two bopdied creature in the savanna grass. He thoguth whatever hunted them now sounded bigger. He thought he heard barking, and by barking his ears meant many dogs, a pack. He thought about the ant, bublling, metasising,a nd woonrede what would happen to him. He didn't give a shit a nbout a rose. He hinched his shoulders and made himself even smaller tjan he flet. He looked across at the Lost Children he could see in the gloom, lighter here, near the edge of the forest- where they had led the predators. The Lost children were beige smudge son blurred brown bluffs. A landscape amateurely painted,w ith accidentally, but watchful; moraines where they should not be. They were coiled. Where the refractions of grinding light hit them, them they were the dark rust of old, discarded metal, in ,lines alomg their limbs and in their hair. Highlights by a painter more professional. They, and the cahse they led the Candy King, piut him mind of the old saying. I don't need to outrun the bear, I just need to outrun you. Tony didn't know why th e forests made him think of bears, but they did, and itw asn't dwelling onteddies, that was for sure. If they were the bait, the Lost Children were the hooks. Tony knew where that put him. Wriggling. As a child Tony had been gullible. As an adult, he had been the same. Now, he was a chld again, he recalled the tiem he had gone camping an dlocal children had convinced him a witch was in the forest, and made him hide behind a bush until it became dark, and his family came calling for him. (Between the trees a bugle sounded. It was difficult to tellm precisel;y where the sound of the call came from, bexcept that it sounded wet as desire.) Of course, that coudlnt' be true, here, cpould it. There weren't any witches. The little pig had said all the witches were dead. Killed most;ly by the Candy Kimnga nd his minions; the suit of tumours. It was enough to make one sick, thought Tony. As Lost Child pointed with his stick, and they were running, once more. His bad ;eg was carrying acudgel behind him, as would a troll. No, that the pink of the rose had been left behind its ligh no longer suffused his injurioes and they, like the rolling bback of tidal waters, were beginning to sump back into the rest of hinm, filling him with black, foetid bilge.

His lungs felt as though they were forced to go truffling for it, by the sound iof their snuffling and wheezing, and really did rewsent the effort. He staggerd to the right and into a tree, and away, spinning like a top about to fall. He thought of the last shot of Inception and wished he was dreaming, and wandered if this would be last turn he made, but the hunt hadn't caught them yet. He was caught, abruptly, by a trotter. Itw as like being caugfht bettn a rock and hard place. He steadied in neck-cricking snap, so only heard the little pig's, 'You're gonna get caught, Gonna give you a piggy back.' Wjhen he was wrenched onto its thin, pink back. Well, pink but for the vomit hues o its hawawaiin shirt. His feet, dangling, even shruneken, longer than the little pifs body, dragged train ytracks, through the dirt. 'Run,' shouted Tony, into the piglet's ear. He was looking back at the woods behind him, withoutn realising he was doing so. All his eyes, and the brain behind ghthnem, had space for was the conjoined quintipluts behind him, fulluy grown, and taking up much of his vision. They wer enear the forest-eaves. The fiove of tumour 9for what else could it be) was gaining, both on the piglet and on Tony's peripereal vision, eating at everything he cou;ld see as it approached. It raised a horn to his lips and blew it. 'Shit,' said Tiny as though the bugle had blown this through his throat. The couyns do fhis curse was loots int eh woods coming ablaze with answering calls. So this is what gfoxes feel like, thought Tony. Folowed bu, wush I was cunning, or, even betterm, fantastic. But he wasn't. He was about to eb caught by Boggis and his mutant kin. Jesus. Pineapples jostled between hgis thights. Bees seemed o buzz and evacuate th Hawain shirt as though giving up on the hive. 'Jump off and run,' the piglet shouted ievr its shoulkder. 'No,' replied Tony. 'You'll not bait this hook so easily.' 'Idiot,' shouted the piglet,a sd threw him ver iust shoujder, forwards into a bush. The disturbneed leaves reminded him of the bees. They scratched angrily at his cheeks, forehead, forarms. Tony came to a rest in series of bad-sahvi ng cuts, like rain on the side windows of a quick moving car. He felt blood in stringed beads on the exposed palnes, rips in sladshes in his t-shirt. He let the blood move, droibblign an dcollecting in pearkling beads,a ndidn't nmove at all apart from these. There was a blare of heat on his skin which ' sweat filled pore by sweat fileld pore0 he realised was not coming from the terror inside him. His eys rioleld horsihly, and saw that sunlight impaled istswelf through the lumoijnous green of the waving eaves, at the other side of the bush. Now, he thought, I'm between a mutant and cancer. Anybody who kenbw anything about the metasising of cells would have founds it diffuilacult to choose between the two, and Tony ' as any writer0- was all fr procrastinating. He lay. He listened. He made the soil wet with sweat. Number five, as his fear-soued brai jad take to callingit, ran passed ina a legiuon of limbs. Well, a cadrem, he added, pedantically. Now, it seemd was atime for the little thinds and taking, fi not pleasure in the, then a bitter saitisfactyion. The itch of sweat in his t-shirt. The way he had weed him self in aspurt. The chewed jaw-stoppefr of breath hold up and rotting behind his teeth. Nuymber five sounded his bigle,a nd, not far behind, anotr replied. This callw as slower moving. No call to panic, thoughnt Tony, and instantly did so, The spurts became aflow. Tnank gOd I'm not wraing underwear, he thought. He gripped the dirt as though to ground himself. it didn't work. His thought sna mind spurted with his penis. That's what you think witn, anyway. Isn't it a hot day, tra la la, you're th victim.# Oh, bugger. That other creatire, the second, ios close by. Hmmm, listening to its feet, I'll call hgim nuber three. Oh dear. Number three has stopped,# Nimber three si sniffing with three quite separate pairs of nostrils. Three tiems two equals I'm screwed. Thnelaves at his feet, where he entered ths patriculat predicament, parted, revealing a face that had been blureed, as if by shutter speed. Into three. There were'niot enough eyes, and nowhere enough by way of sanity, but it smiled agreeably enough. 'I would very much likento introiduce to my kinbg, young man,' said the three of tumours. TYony had never felt quiet so young, nor anywhere enar as unammed. At least his bladder was relaxed. No otrher organ of himwas; his heart felt as though it thought it legs were running, his legs souned as if they jpoined in with this self-decption, his kith would relly rather have liked to scream, nbut didn't feel up to the job. The three of tumours filled in for this, opening all of its maws and keening.

Tony wonredred how much blood they hd to lose. It was becominhg excessive. They had it, now, howvere, by the liquid-sticky end of the stic,, but did pull, instead, drawing the spear throught he first body which was now handging deadweight, pulling the other two to Tony's left. Bush-leaves jostled liem jazz hands. Then Tony caught a glimpse of the Loist Child. He was too addled by terror to be conused. Ina straighter frame of mind, he would have thoguyht; why aren't you runnigm? Why are you still jhere? Now, all his mind did was except what his eyes force fed it, an, somehow, managed not to shut down. The Lost Chid was staring at him, eyes as still as a face that is sleep walking, and allowed the three of tumours to draw it him. Itw as a him. His flat chest smeared by too long out herree. He was an elf now, no lonegra boy, ti seed, a changling of Tnis Pace, left exposed. But he had survived against the odd, againsttn he commnasd of this Candy King, and now he was sacrificing himself for Tony. He thinks I'm the one. He's wrong. Four sensible hands took the boy in their grip, allowing some roaming across his body, while tjhere ws enough to grip him. They need't have. The boyw asn't for running. The two other arms of the three of tunmours hing i8nsesible and swuing as it tottered about and hefted the Lost Child off the soil, and , by the bush to Tony's left, into the sunlight he could feel sizzling, as a sausage might the incipient heat of frying pan, close at hand. He kept his fongers aeway, for fear not so mich of scol,ding as cancer. Therw as a rustle at Tony;'s right, and he closed his eyes, tnr off now, he begged his mind, liem C34PO. 'It's me,' said Joanne. A voice his eaqr knew so well it could well be on the inside of it. 'I've been hidjng nearby. You let that tnhinsg take the biy.' Eyes opening. Tony nodded. 'He thinks you're the one' Joanne hissed. Her whispers were always too loud., always in public, always accustastory, 'You're not.' Tonyt shook his head. So, she had been aawake, beforewe th piglet. 'And ou'rw going to let hi,m die anyway.' Better him than me. He didn't say this. He saids, 'Yes.' And tried his best to lookm ashamed. He felt only fearl, still, crocuhingw ithin him like jaguar about to ponce, and justg as black. 'Sire,' he heard. Tony didn't know, if he craned his head, if yhe iopened his eyes, if he had any spine whatsoever to do either fo these thinbstg with, he would see berteen the foliage. 'It's the Candy King.' Joann'e whisper was quietned, now. Yes, he would be able to see, he ould only surmise. 'Sire,' the three of thmours repeated, with two of its mouths. An echo between close alls. 'We have n offering.' 'Ah, yes, ah yes,#' acme a vpice, obscuredc by cloth or the husking of a sack, ro some such thing. Tony didn't want to se, and his mind refused to imagine it. 'Up with his head, up with his head.' The voice was wet, lisping, and cut right through him. 'Up with his head.' It made a gurgle sound, appreciative a s Getman burp, but backwards. Beside Tony. Joanne gulped,a nd then could, be heard to reretcvh, as though she could not swallow the scene, or it jhad goine down the wrong way. To her, ot wasn't supposed to happen like this, Tony, knew, he was supoeds to throiw himself before th rtumoru, out into the sunlight. But he had always disappointrd her, and Tonyn coul;d not quite work out how she could, npretend to be surprised. JHe tighten the grip his eyelids had on his eys,a nd tried to listen to the sound of somtheing wetm, tumesecent, grasping thre Lost Chil'd head, his face, nor the sound of it sucking. He recalled thre shadow play on the ward-wall. He treid to imagie hews not here at all, but in a pristine, snow bound forwsart, the caw of hyungruy crows. He ahd enoguyhn of an imagiknation,m at leats, to spare him this. But the way the cancer moved swiftly thporugh the young boy/'s body was invasivce. It moved though Tony, ion its way, the image of it. He couldn't shake it, and wouyldn';t be abl to, for many days. He added tears ro the copver of his pupils, but theh diodn;t fill his earhole,s and his ciowardicxe extebded to his fingers which he found rooted to the soil. H couldn't move them. Eith a gulping more successful than that of his wife, the Cnhady koingf, or whatever anybody called him, gulped ndown the Lost child as if he were a thick, prtien supplement. Get that down you, Tony couldn't' help but think. 'Sire,' the thereof tumours could be heard to say. 'Could I interest you in a scumtious desret? Why just down their in the earth.' 'Quiet,' said the king. In the distancem, ahorn could be heard. 'Sire,' repetade three, rtying, ti seemd, to be insisrent. 'Silence,' the Candy King became petulant. @how dare you sir. That is the nine. If the nine calls, do you really think I would ignore hiomfor you? Nine heads are better than three, after all,mfor thinking, and one of yours looks decidly brain dead.' 'Yes, liege,' the three of tumours wa srediced to sayinmg. A Chidl held up a finger to his mouth. I didn't notice it first.

The memories stacked up in t eh air above us like airplanes that cpould nti be allwed to land, liem 9/11. Still, we followd. The Lost Boy led us around the eavse fo the wood, and by these, to the tal savanaa grass. Before long I rcognised the fall of sun ligh, the patrerns of foliage and the shapes the sun braneded into the earth. He s taking us to rabbit hole and, I guess he supoosed; home. We followed, and, before what I thoguth waas long (the sun may or may not be above the overgrown vegetation but, fi itw as never, it neither waned nor waxed to noon), we [assed to corpse of the ant, an, by this faintly bubbling makrer, to the hole. The Lost Boy passed it's weapon to Tony, who received like a relay runner who thoguth he was more likely to droip the baton. I didn't look at him, but down intot eh dark of the hole. Somehwere beolow twere the furtuive sound of burrowing and I thought of stroing, well-evolved shukders, sharp claws, eyes broghetend by the though if our flesh to feed on. Then hole seemd tighet viewed from abouve. We descended. Down the rabbit we wriggled. I, first, Tony making a meal of his liump, as he did when pretending not to understand recipes, or what to buy in the supermarket, so that I took the lead. He was useless, really. Really useless. Really. I was not quite first, but pushed the Lost Boy's stick before me, and followed this, its point lost in the dark of th e warren in a way I wished the bright eyes would be, but weren;t. they were bright with malice, and more bold than they had been before, closer, and bigger, niot just because of the promiximity, but due to way things grew big in This Place, under that sun. The stick kept them at bay and following it I felt like the string behind the needle, going through the eyelet. Behind me, when I looked back. Ton y was a pallid stretch of forearms, and grimed cheeks, wriggling like a paparplegic worm, in wide oscillations. If we were thepale string what kind of shroud were we weaving? It wouldn't cxover the dyting world we returned to. And why was I thunking this way, what was with all the questions? There would be too few left to answer them. We reached the bottom of the rabbit hole, and the lift below it and, by the rope, climbed down into its chamber. Besides ourselves in apssing, the end of the rope still held the decanter, but it was filed again, woth green, viscus liquid. On its stopper was tagged another crumpled, ancient-yellow note which read, in the carefulcalligraphy fo someone who had not noticed the world was ending, 'This Will Take You Forward' [calligraphy?] The lift stank of half eaten meat and cat faeces and cat vomit besides, where the feline had lefta ragged line near the doors. It looked the attempted digestion of a aspien. There was no sign of the bald rabbit. The cat itself slept in the corner, oblivious to the smell it had created. Its features did have the appearance of disgust, bt this was its normal look. I pressed my forearm to my nose, both fileteringt he mirk of the lift, and taking in the scent of my own sweat, tight and musty and heavy as a small wardrobe full of ancient, fur coats. I needed a shower, as much to watch away what I had seen as what I smelt like. The floor reader was stuck to [square root] -1, the arrow bent up and awayu from the number as though in a sharp excla,mation mark of shock. The 'I' of the information button was still lit, and through the interciom could be heard, through the interference of electrical spitting, that sound of a bugle clearing its throat. I shivered and helped Tony to the tiles of te florr, and to miss a trail of mactated rabbit. He sliped,r egardless, on a puddle of unseen urine, and scowled. I shrugged. 'The doors won't open,#' I said. 'You've tried them?' I shrugged again, but quicker, as though throwing his question off, as though he were a monkey. 'They won't open.' H etried them. They didn't. I unstoppered the bottle of green liquid and took a sniff and gagged, and used my forearm, again, but lower, against my lips, which wera tight line of shut. 'That good?' His smile was as wan as the rest fo him. We had seen the sunlight, but neither of us had felt the sun in too long. I could have said, 'It smells of despair, of rott, but not any old body, I think I can smell my perfume in it. I think it smells of my body just after I die.' But thatw as his kind of way of speaking, and I ws seek of anything writerly. 'Yeah, great.' 'We're gonna have to, aren't we?' He was still smiling and it ahd been there too logn. I could see his cheeks twitching from the effort of keeping it stetched over his bteeth. The impalers were beinning to show, like a vampire that couldn't keep up appearances. That, thoug, is how he always looks to me, especially in public. 'Down the hatch,' I said,and drink. My left hand vl;ecnehs on the stopper, as a tatse as vile as the smell inside the lift floods me. I concentrate on hard balled glass beneath my fingers and, at first, don; notice them stretching, or the unclipping of my vertebraeas, as my spine lengethened, or balling then ballooning of my breast.

{"text": "as my hips had been, previously, and dry heave against the ground. After momnents of mining my belly, all I had to show for it was a line of drool. I spata dn looked up at Tony through eyes that had garnered their own pool of liquid. 'Your round,' I said, but it is hiss,m and more bile dribbles out, and I give up. He seems to get the gist, besides, and walks up to me and, taking thedecanter, drinks. I ignore his mewling, as I do whenever he has man flu, and wait until it is over, then ros,e and press '3'. With a judder then a lurch the lift jolts forward nd keeps gouing in that direction. They huddled in the cornber of the loifdt6 like rabbi9ts in their hurcyhes, lefdt out in the cold of the garden. All that was left of the real rabbit wcould be seen riudging the vomit. Tony hugged himselg around the t-shirt's logo ('Breaking Good', by Qwertee, of Walkter White in a Pontiff's hat, giving a blessing) and by there the t-shirt hugged his ribs. Kneeadxed with sweatm, as it had been, the cotton had been cooling ever since the lift doors had reopened, back on '3', giving his abdomen what felt like a thin skate of ice, as that overa puddle when winter comes. A little like the Place they had been, that jkidn of ice was not something to rest your faith on. Yet, 'We have to go back,' said Joanne. Either the chil or his wife jhad pushed his teeth to rest precariously on each other, on their edges, and grinding techtonically. This was as good as it got. His mind felt like the edge was somewhere far behin d it, a line which was now only vaguely visible. 'Yeha, tell me about it.' By which he meant; don't. He didn't know how much more of the cold or the hunher he could stand. He kenw he couldn't take any more of his wife speaking. Everything inside was a stechnotnic as his teeth. They were in the back two corhners of the lift. Sepearetde by a bank of earth where it had skittered when the lift had plunged forward. After the button had been pressed, the speed fo their acceleratuion hads borne both Joanne and Tony onto theirt toes lie,k evil spirits in Japanese hoprror movies., These days, horror movies just semed like grinding realism. Across the tirles of the lift, the cat, its faeces, its vomit and, just as uncoordinated, Joanne and Tony had skidded back intot eh wall furthest from the door. He found it impossible to fihjt his way forward. The air might as well have been a tsunaqmi in full flow. Him, a stavened insect. Now, the lights in his body felt as if he was going out This was the natural tinme to die. Never mind George Martin, winter had come in however lon g they had been in That Place. Like his wife, Winterw asn't for fucking around, ti seemd. 'We're just fuckinga round here,' said Joanne, proving her earlier point. In motions of zombie determination she rose. She shiverede as though her skin were coming loose and strode through the smear moarks of hwart had been left on the tiles to the lift controls. Before them, like wincing eyes, the lift doors were firmly shut. They had opened as the licfdt ahd erached '3' half an hour ago, or so, with a hiss as though the kift were exhaling its last, and all the life and warmth opf ti lefdt and steamed out into a dark corridor. Tony guessed the lights had gone out wherever the sun had gone. It miust be quite some party there, bhe thought. 'wait,' he said, He didn't know why7. She was doing thw pnly thin g they could do. Gpign backl There, where the suit of tumours would hunt theme for their andy King. In the end *(their end, it may as well be called) ythe cold was a better huntsmantahn anyth other tyhing, and looked set to serve them, chilled as from the fridge, to its master, Death, in the nexty few hours. T-shirts were not the thing to be seen in during the apocaplse, iot cvould be safely said, Joanne stared at him. Her eyes said what but her mout didn't btoehr. She pressed the '-1'. Tony looked up,. The light red terminator eye of the cctv camera had winked out, but he imagined the scene, from above, of an ex wife and ex-husband, in the grey, colourless, pixelletadde mddle of the cctv. The warmth and gone out of their relationship as surely as it had gone from the lift. And she didn't know about Maragart. He did. Itw as ahrd for his mind to let go of the image of his mother-in-laws sneering lips around his penis, in the downstairs toilet. It was difficult, at thr very least. The lift went down. As a writer, Tony was good at formulating a narrative about himself. He could have been great, but for the way his wife made him work. He oculd have dedicated himself to his craft, in chilly, unheated council flats and worked his waty down into the flesh of the world, in a housing estate, like a bad seed amongst broken families. But, at times, events conspiured with his wife to press his mose uop against the window of himself so hard it crackerd then shattered the pane. This was not a pleasant experience for someone who thought he knew hwo he was. A writer. This was one of those experiences. The narrative of arc of himself become ashatterdc scimitar. Frozen then broken, each segment cutting at him and nto one of them magical, and none of them ever, ti felt, tp be reassembled into a weapon that could fight back this nevereneding darkness.

Crawling up through the rabbit hole, crocked because of huis ebnt leg, he was a tendril from that ad seed. He had gone beyond shivering, his limbs grinding where they were not held tense against each other, tight as his teeth. The rabbit droppings,now that he was pressed against them inthese tunnels, had passed beyond the discreet brown baubles they were up, in the open, and against his clammy skin, felt full and liquid as the plague on the body of a corpse/. Contained tight as he wasw, his mind, his perception wass in bits. He hunted a adiolescent, fur-bound rabbit, in its warrens and kuilled it in bits,. Darknes, then the thrusting of the Lost Children's stick. Squels of terror and pain. The cries fo its parents, its mother, Tony could onluty think ' from the pitch. Furtively skinning its fur from ist flesh, up in That Place, beneath the fgiant, prehistioric, savanna grass, Bloodied Rib cages of fauna beneath the green riubg=cgades of the flora that strreteched aabive. He didn't waste a bit. Flashes of cooking the raabiit's meat in triangules of sunlight, at the edn fo the same stick. Of turning and drying and curing the hide in the sun. The b0ne shsarpened for dggers. The eyballs cooked along with the rest. His stomach wasn't for turning anytign out. He worked feverously, with flashes of lucidity, barbecuing meat, skinning, killing, and going around the merry go round of slaughter again , all the time his ears pruicked high and twitching for the sound of the hunting horn. The periods of lucidity dimmed and scurried from eacj other, leaving long expanses of frightened, twitchy, savaargry when Tony would have thought himself an animal if he jhad thought at all. He heard the horn, but always in the distance. There were children out tther, to be chased, after all. Joanne didn't follow hi monto the surface, which was a good thing, he would think later, when thinking retirned to him. H ehad always wondered what would becaome of his temper if he ever turned senile. Itw a s snewy monster beneath the fathioms of his manners, his smiling civility, charm shot therough with flashe of of teeth. They had glimpsed enough of the animal tighter, and, in thos emomenets, it would have been hard to see the human. Eventually he decscended back though the tnnels of blood and the stench of sweat soaked with terror, and where, by the smell, he had [pissed to scent his own territory. Coming back to himaelf, he descended the rope, and sunk the green liquid, and tossed furs onto Joanne, who had dwindled in her corner fo the lift as stars do at dawn, to the extrems of the horizon. Stil, she atem the meat, and wore the hides and when they had steeld themselves, she pressed the button to take them back, againm. [On first look; two things. The screen flicked every six seconds betweens scenes so close in their particulars the differences were difficult to spot. It seemed, instead, to be one segment omna loop. It wasn't. The date in the bottm left ahand corne may have stayed the same, but the time at the opposite right ticked om. Secvonds later, it would seem impabacble. The second; the grey of the cctv images gave the skin of the bodies ont eh salbs a pallour that suggested the doctor with the scalpel cutting into their braisn couls only be a cornoer. He wasn't. The heart monitors at the back peaked in denying, robust, inverted v-signs. Second laterm the viewer would wonder how their hearts continued at all. Closer inspection, showed three very separate bodies. A man, a woman, a child. An obese, hair threaded man. A scarecrow, small chinned woman. A little girl. Closer inspection, however, would not bring rwards, only sanctions, when all three sat up on their surgical tables., opened their mouths, screamed, their scalps drawing back as though yawning lips over tooth white skulls. The instant sheen of blood,m collecting, somehow, in the corners of their eyes and flowing from there, as though they cried so hard they had burst the ducts. Their temples stetching, going straight up. Pointy headed patients. The camera flicked from one scene to the next, all three, at the sam time, risen to a right angle and wailing, while around them, like the flicking of the cameras, surgeons hands flapped, anaethesiatics tagged their machines, interns vomited on the grey floor. 17.41. It said. 17.41. 17.41. And all the while, the pointed,m drawn skulls with their grey, silent screaming.] [He reached toard the screen and around the side of the image, as though sctracthing at an itch the viewer couldn't see, and eh could barely reach. By the look on his face, the itch was not gojgn away.

Wheezing, he settles his wife like a overfilled bag beside the rear-right wheel. She falls onto the hard shoulder and he reseats her and opens the door. The keys are in the ignition. He slides his wife into the back seat. He pinions her against the upholstery and tries to plug the seatbelt in. His hand, sweaty all the way up to his armpit, slides off it, can't make it 'click'. He can't lie her down, he thinks, she might slide off and into the footwell, where, semi-conscious as she is, her head might land at an odd angle, throat bent with it, oxygen unable to follow. The sweat on his pale arms is chilling, and beading like a Sauvignon in the fridge. Tony needs a drink. 'I'll catch my death.' He looks up at the sky. It's the first time he considers the cold and his flesh goosebumps, and not all of it at the temperature. It's been a barbecue day, the kind where the t-shirt on your back stuck as uncomfortably close and cloying as the gaze of his mother in law, and the memory of her lips on him in the coat cupboard. The kind of barbecue where you try not to turn the sausages too nervously, too often, or to touch them. He went for the burger. Tony drags Joanne to the right and [redact] 'What are you doing?' The sweat on Tony's skin sharpened, droplets digging in to his nape like eye-teeth. The voice came again, growing as it neared, its BBC accent towering in the gloom. 'Well' what are you doing?' Tony doesn't reply but thinks, instinctly, Where..? There; unmistakably, tall as the accent, with a beard as clipped. The figure is wearing Received Fashion as precisey tailored as his words wear Received Pronunciation: measured, double-breasted suit, tie, triangle of kerchief, cuff-links, right hand twitching like a man who's recently been parted with his briefcase. He says, 'Come along and help her, won't you?' Tony shut the boot. 'What are you doing?' repeats BBC. So that's where the dog went, Tony thinks, of the contents of the boot. Instead, Tony says, 'You don't want to know.' He really doesn't. What a stink. BBC sighs. 'Come on!' His RP accent was not to be argued with, not by a Southerner, and Tony hastened toward it, and the outline of its owner which towered over the woman at the stranger's side. The woman was shorter than Joanne, but injured in the same places; across the head and arm. From her skirt, however, came a fried chicken smell of skin blistered by fire. Her eyes were wild and white. The smell of her skin reminded him of the barbecue. He put her spare arm over his left shoulder and tried not to think of drumsticks. 'Are you sniffling, man?' said BBC. 'No,' Tony said, truthfully. He didn't add; I'm sniffing. KFC. 'Help me get her in the car then, please.' 'The seatbelt doesn't work.' BBC guides the woman into the seat, bending her to its right angles. Dog mingles with chicken. There was the click of a belt. Tony reddens, and feels it's visible, even in the dark. BBC is looking at him (Tony knows it by the pause) and the writer stops sniffing. Tony says, 'I don't think I can drive. I have'' He indicates his right temple. The man sighs again, as he walks away. Like a delating tyre, thinks, Tony, this is the way he rolls. There's a creak on the CX's far side. It becomes a slam as the driver's door closes. Tony gazes along the motorway's lights. They are fake-tan 'orange beside the ruddier fires that blaze, from place to place along the route. Tony gets in. 'Take care of her, yes?' says BBC as he palms the gears into first. The car glides string-ray-like between two empty vehicles. It isn't hard to imagine them on the ocean foor. The dark helps. Beneath their wheels can be heard the grind of glass or plastic. Wreckage, them the flotsam. Tony's teeth grit. 'Okay,' he says, but mutters, 'I have to look after my wife too, if that's alright with you.' BBC stares at him. Tony tries to put an arm around Joanne's shoulders, tries to appear protective. The height disparity means he can't reach. The other woman ' BBC's woman - has slouched back and to the left, sweating like a salted slug around the wheel arch there, and is still but for the lolling of he tongue, the line of drool that pendulmines down to her jeans, and her lips mutturing twistedly, 'Am I?.. Am I?.. Am I?..' As with most things these days, Tony is unsure, both of the answer and the question. It won't be long before he stops thinking in terms of days. '' Am I?' 'Amy, Amy, Amy...' This is vague, unlike the, Hunnnnh hunnnnnu hunh inside my head. '' Aimee, Aimee, Aimee.' The word may not have been 'Aimee'. Thank God, I've heard enough of that name, I think. The crackle of tarmac seasoned with glass. I' '. I' [thought bubbles of black] ' I. The motorway has never seemed thinner, the hills and sky and moor bunching in. Ahead, the chain of street lights is broken. The CX drives into the pitch. They pass a wrecked Mercedes, lit sub-marinally by their headlights. BBC slows to first gear and Tony peers in at the diodes on the dashboards, reds and greens and electric blues. Abruptly, a head reers against the side-window. Gorgon in its cave, her hair writhes as she opens her mouth. Blonde, he thinks, from its springy waviness. He can't hear her, and is as unable to make noise as she seems to be,", "label": 1}

'As any but the poorly eductade will be able to see, the tumouyrs affect different parts opf the brain. What you won't be able to tell, not without a barrage of tests, is that these three brains, blood,s people, are compatible, medicall;yiable transplant doneors, eacj for the other.' Dr Amin looked to his side, his neck bloated like a frogs above the starched edge of his collar. His adam's apple and tie knot bulged as thoughn he was swallowing an insect, a she stared at a door that could be seen,. Vaguely, in the backgfrouhdn, There also, muted so that the sound was unsure, was a knock, or a crack of thunderm or a gun ebing fired, or Dr amin;s world falling in. He looked back tot eh scre n on which he could be seen. 'There is a surgery called Domino surgery,. Each fo these patienst had something to be hgained form the others. As their tumours were attached to distinct and different sites, they ech had healthy, viable brain tissue that could be grafted onto another of the three, in order to replace a successful excvision of the cancer.

A complicated surgery, this is the Pghgy Back elemet, neew tisuue leeched to old.'

Eventually,he quietened an rocke,dd so that the bare sound was the crak iof a chair, an dthne rose, and carried his daughter back tot eh door, that could be seen in the background of the screen, and opend it, and walked through it with her.] The shutting of the luift doors was a gravelly thunk , not unl;ike a lowered coffin hitting its resting place. The air ws cold and compacted as dirt down deep in the land, loamy. And Tony breathed it in throughn compressed liups and grated teeth, sieving of it as much of the chillas he could. He couldn't. In his throat, the air's progress was harsh as drinkignbleach and, Tony supposed, muchg more exposure to this would be suicide. His eyes tended to agree, as dfid his mind, and he attempted to keep his gaze fixed on the centre of the corridor. His wife's hand had found his own, and then her arm then crtook of his, and then her flank his body,. Then rabbit skins swathed them but their efetcivenmess eas dim inching, all thhe more, in each passing step, as his sweat6ing increased,. On the inside of his ecently killed hoides, he was devleopinga layer of cooling water no0t afr removed from ice. It enca\\sedf him.

He wished he could stop thim nkin of deatk, and not only his,.own, but also that of the people suspended along the corrdior's wall,s andx formk its ceiling. 'It looks like ASlins,' said his wfe, in astuter fo shivers. Itw as the kind of thing he would have expected to saym himseld, and, so , Tony could n o disagree. Iot did. It was ahrd to look right at them. It was harder to rid the sight of them forom jhis brain. Their boeides were aklive. Despite the drapes and snaking limbs of what could only eb described of as cancer gone wild, pulsed and drained from their bodies, there chests palsied to hard drawn br4eaths, their ribscages heaved to the ebat of hewarts under duress, blood pressurised by the tentacles to pumop, to feed thenm. These weren't humans, anymore, so much as feeding sacs, food bags, hay bags. 'She's not this fucking important,' said Joanne. She was talking about his ,othert. They ade never gotten along. Oir, more to the point, Joanne had blamed her vfor all that was wrong with him. Yet, still; she continued to walk down the corridor toward jher ward, and before that, through their marraieg and, lomngt before that, down the aisle. One of the bodies ' Tony's mind havered from labelling them 'humans' ' moaned. I didn't beg for death, it didn't thrash. Instead it moned, and then gave a short fart. It se3emed al it could manage, ontop of feediong what was growing ourt of the walls as grass through aving stones. Clsoe by the cracks, it was warm but, though his body had shivered so much nit now felt inacble of doing so, anymore ' Tony did not dare approach the tentacles of what must be red and purple veined. In the dark, it was impoosible to see, but he smelt blood and the thick, slick flavour fo open wounds, and his imaginatuion supplied the rest. Now, more than ever, he could have done without his imagimation. 'I can't kill hikm. He's our da.' This ' th shout- caufght Tony off guard. He stoped and along side him so did joanne.

Shoioting thos epoor arseholes in the head liekm they werem't going to just keep on bleeding, keep on feeding whatever the fuck it is coming through the walls.' 'Fuck! Fuck! This is all fucked up.' Tony couldn't hjel;p but agree with the latter's sentiment. The door was approaching now. Tony didn';t feel as though he were walking toward it, buyt rather that uit was roundingon him, like the first hyena in a pacvk of doors. He had had enough of entarfnecways and existm, from Tjhis Place or That. They always led to someplace worse. He thought of frying pans an fires and fantasy lands where wraiths were real./ Without realising it, he had come to stand, now, in the door. Two heads faced each other, and a gun, Jony and Dabvey, lit by torches they both held. Tony guessed there would be ar,s and legs and trigger fingers invilevcd in there somehwree, as well,m in the dark, buyt he didn't have longt o contemplate this, before a light stabbed him in the eye,s and then Jpnnhy's light. 'Who the fuck are you, amte?' The question was as threatening ' as pointed ' as the barrel of the gun piomnted at him, and the bullet Tony imagined within it. 'It's that bloody writer.' 'Oh,' davey was still dancing, but his ricking backward and forth of a waltz had intensified to a tango his fet danced with themselves. Not only did he not seem to need a partner, but Tony doubted anybody would be able to keep up wityh his manic footwork. Nor want to. 'Do yourself a favour and fuck off mate.' GTony didn;'t know whaicjh one was speaking. He felt Joanne tighten aginst his side, rtatcheting gerself to huim, before he reakised it wass he who was doing the tightening of the screw. 'I know what's happening,' Tony said. 'What mate?' said Johhnnny. Tony recopgnised the tone of somebody at elast teyhered to reality, even if reail;ity, in the case of everything they all knew, had slipped its own morring several weeks ago. Tokny wsn't surprised he hgad asked, he could barely hear himself. he clarde his throat, swalloed, tried again. 'I know what's happening. What's coming out of the alls og the Hills. What's on the other side of the walls.' 'Do yopu? Do you, mate?' said Davey. Tony din't understand why,. He had already said he did. He continued, ploughing through it while his limsb refuised to move at all, but for rediscovering the ability to sahke, thought, this time, not with the chill. 'I know what your father is,' he said. 'And what's that?' Johnny. flat, deadly as the arc of a buyllet of the distance between tOnyt and that gun. 'he's the candy King.' I didn't see the scne through the eyes of thre first person., I was some way beyond even the third. Perhaps it was the cold, but my mind felt numb right the way down the my conscsience, and I watched as Davey shot Tony's mother cdead as though I were a thousand narrative-persons down the line. I might was well ahev not been there at all. They didn't notice me. As earlier, in the private room, when I had shown my leg, my sm,ile, I was revisted by being a woman without beauty in a man's world./ Not unattraitve, but without being particularly attractive. I supopose I will ahev to take that back. Unattractive. Yes, unattractive. I didn't attract Davey's eye as aI screeched (I would like to have called it a scream, but even to my ears it held none of a scream's intergrituy, lost itself halway though, and cebloped inyo a full blown squeal.) 'Your' Dad is the Candy King,' Tony had said. It was hard to see how this bstatement led to the brains of Tony's mother flicking far enough across the room to artex the wall in shark-fin line sof grey. I couldn't bring myself far enough out of the numb, cold state in which I found myself frozen, like a statue of a witch's enemy, to give a shit. This didn't help my memory. He was, like those statutes, transparent to me and, written right through him, as thourbggh rock, one word, a wotrd he hated to be called and, upon discovering this, I'm not too proud to admit that I call him soa s often as I'can.

The way his tone shot down in pitch, and seemd to come from deeper in his chest, as though arabbit that had hurtl;ed into its burrow and dug and and was speaking in what the rabbvit thought was not only human tones, but manly ones, at that.

'Tony'' I could see where this was going, but he never listened, especuial;ly not tyhese days' this niught, I su[pose. 'Tony, mate.' It was Johnny's turn, and tOny listened to him.

All three just sacks of cancers doing nothing but cancering on the inside?' 'Oi,' said Davey. His eyes flashed as though icons uploading. Dear Davey, I thinkl.

'So you'r esayign, et me get this stariught mate,' he didn't soun dliek he meant either, about getting it straight or Tony ebing his mate.

The Prat was showing now. I can almost here the crack of Tony breakinh apart,. I imagination rock, once more. My mind sleep walks though the steps. So, this is hgow e get to Davey placing the gun against the forehead of Tny's mther. It is pallid and, even in the flat light cast by the torch in Davey's pother hand, you kniow it's sweaty. There's a smell of urea in here, hwoever. Maybe the image is suggested. 'You won't mind if I do this then.' If angels can dancve on pij nhead, Daveuy seemed as able to rtun, to pirhoutte, ona s small a space. He pulled the trigger and Yonyw ent to floor and jher brains went to the wall.

'Jesus,' the word comes again. I can't hel;p- but notice that the heart monitor beside her bed doesn't respond at all, but continues with its pegamtic, rthythmic beeping, like a lorry backing over a puppy. It must be broken. Mty mind knows how ot feels, I think./ Davey's torch light is a spot on Tony';s face, the featres of which writhe like a vampire's if theer were still a sun to disintrigrate uncder. Tehn vapires, I reckon, must be having a partuy fo time, right now. All that blood. I remember the wall, and the shark fins of grey mater. Cirvcling.

The barrel of Davey's gun is pointed at thye writer but I think he will rise, nonetheless. H eapears to try but his legs won't support, and Tony sprawls on his chest, his face and forehead atrwictsed upward t stare at his mother's killer. The wrinkling of the forehead shortens the devl, making it appear patheticall small. Prat, I think, again. I know it isn't right, but I cabn't help it. Just look at him, I think,a d I look away, there is s hirt in his eyes that was dragging my in, making me care. And I can't. the world is shovering, it's so cold. I relaise I am moving sideto side, like a child who needs the toilet,a dn that this is because In am freezing. Humanity is dying. Though Tony is on eof the last men alive, it seems I cannot care for him. Te rest is a somnabolic walz. Johnny and Davey won't leave their father or the little girl here, and make tOny, at gunpimt, lift the girl;, as they carry their father, out of the ward. They have a plan, to sela them all in theares on floor five. To limit power input to that level. The thetres are hermetic, their own vemtiollation, their own heating, and just so for emergencies such as this. Wrll, not the sun turning off, but I got Johnhyt';s point.

It wasn't onlythe tattroo that was on his face but all the rest of Tony, too. His mind was on the part of him one inch above where it should reside. His freatures worked, his cheeks bunched, his mouth tightened into the small hole fo a small dog doing its best not to defacte. His forehead may have been red, as was the rest of his skin,m but if Tony could put his kind to anywhere deeper. Bhe would have known theat the red tide swilled down deep into his past. He felt, now, as he had for years in his marrauge, important. He felt now as he had as a child , unable to gthink fo aretort to his step-father. But he wasn';t to know this, not when all of his thoughts rested on killing Davey, shhoting him in the face as Daveyh had his mother, and all of the memories were repressed. H esat, even, in the theatre, pressed down beneath a sink, face hidden as that of a small child beneath a table in a classroom, refusing to be coaxed out, not that anybody was doing any coaxing. All they did was watching, both of Johnny's eys on him, and Davey's ewhen they weren't bouncing about the room to the rhythm of his jostling heels, and the eye at the end of the barrel of the gun Johnny held. That eye, thjough blank, was justa s watchfgul, as all the rest of them, and Tony didn't need to think to imagine the readiness of the bullet within. It glinted in his red-misted mind like the joke in Davey's eye,w ehne they had arrived at the surgery theatre, and he had said, 'Why dso sad, little Tony? Want your mummy?' And Tony hadn't heard Johnny when he'd said, '|Enough' because his attentiojn had risen with his blood to his skina dn all he could ehar was the sound of Davey choking beneath his fingers. Now, though ti went usn een, it could be sensed that the group's hearingw as as watchful as their eyes ' filled to the brim with each sound in their hearing. In the distance could be ehard screaming. Given the hermetic nature fo the theatre (sealed bar the mesh of the ventilation shaft and the hot aior that sieved Vadarosh through it) that distance may not have been greater than a few doors. It was closing and had been ever since the lights had varied, as though a dimmer switch between the fingers fo a six year old. 'Oh Ah Cantona.' It was Johnny's turn to blush. 'Oh Ah Cantona.' There was no gloating in the tone of the chant, btu defiance, low and dirgeful,. The sound of human words a s deathj closed in. 'Oh Ah Cantona.' By the spound of the scream ing outside the thetere; it would not be their deaths. There were three other men in the room (Tony did not know their names and didn't care to, finding it diffilcult to acrwe for anything but brains cshaped lilke shark fins) and two women. The women regarded him as if he were a diseased ravbit. He realisded, on some ignored lebvel, that the furs he wore were beginning to curdle into the smell fo something small and dead and hidden beneath the floorboards. YTony was used to the loks of the women. Not for the first time simnce his mother's death, and for a countless time in their relatriionship,m his wife was regarding him the same way. 'Oh Ah Canyona. Oh Ah Cantona.' They swelled with the screaming, catching the emotuion, it seemd, u ntil they nearly eclipsed the sound of its variacve into human words, into meaning, hoarse and choked and almost forgotten to the tongue, by ist sound, of the speajker. 'Plkeasr. I can hear you in there. Please let me in.there's something in the walls.' The door to the theatre was locked.

I domn't want to end up like the others.' Scarbbling. The rabbit furs on Tony's limbs were abruptly itchy. He didn't move to scratch it. The soudnof something wet, as a slug must sound to a leaf.

{"text": "x-rayish. 'Oh'.' The chant failed, sounding at its demise like an innuendo, a Kennth Grammar. It would have made Tony smiule, if his face wasn't so fixed in hatred, and the brain behind it in fear. 'Shit,' someone said. Itw as one of the unnamed males. It didn't matter, Tony wouldn't jhave known who it was, even if it had been him. All he could notice, now, ws the sound of wetness and the screaming beyond the door. The woman in the hanger in alien, his brain offered. As the first thing he had managed to think in some time, it wasn';t comforting. Whatever the wetness was, it inside the woman on the other side of the door. 'You have rot open it'' a woman in thew theatre managed, before her voice was interrupted by the vomit that cam eup with it. The scrraming turned to squeking, as if the woman was being pulled away from thedoor and to the wall on the opposite side of the xcorridor. No as if about it, Tony thought. After about the time it would take someone to die underwater, no matter how big a whoop of air they had taken, the lights above the group jutted and returenmd, glaring, too honest for Tony's nerves. He looked at a floor tile,a dn away from FDavey for the first time since he had sat here, beneath the sink. 'Whyw as it so hot?' A woman asked. 'Haints.' Said Johnny, a word like a gulp but backwards, justa sliquid with fear, but out of him. ;What?' Tony said. He hadn;r realised he needed to speak, until he was unable to stop himself. 'Hot springs.' Said Johnny. 'What?' Tony repeated, alolowing all of the sarcasm, of his chodlhood, of his marriage, to well up. It had ever been his weapon, when everuybody welse was always holding the gun. 'Some writer you are,' sad Jonny. 'Try readfing so books yourself. Haven't you ever read To Kill a Mickingbird. It's th sign fo aghost,a s pirirt from someplace else. The ehat,. Haints. Hot springs.' 'Not soemthign in the walls. Soemthing beyond the walls.' Said Davey. If Tonmy ddin';t haet him so much he would have agreed. 'We shoukd opne the door,' said a woman. Marj, or so Tony thought. The ice of fear had chilled the red mist in his blood. She was older than tenother, red haired with roots of white that grew outwards as the snow mounted about the Hills. No one agreed but Johnny was walking to the oor. He pressed a green button at its right and proper it with his left foot. He leaned out. He raised his gun and his finger moved on its trigger, bhut not inward, toward himself, but in twitching caresses, as though he wanted to love the gun but could do no more tham pretend. 'It's another one.' Tony didn't have t rose. His imagimnation was working fine now. H ehad seen them before, after all. The writhing tumours multiplying like insecst beath the skin. The tentacles sunk into her orificies, into her mouth stopping her screams , but the screames were still there, all too visible in her wide, white, rolling eyes. Another foodsac fpor the cancer in the walls. 'Shut the door.' Said Joanne. 'Please.' 'Shuit the door.' Said Tony, unable to help repeating her. 'Please.' Johnny ignired him his finger on the trigger, but not still. 'Donm't mate. It6's a waste of bullets, you know it.' He did, it appeared, after a moment, because he tuned, let the door shut and went and sat on the table in the centre of the room, forehead an dcheeks as pallid someone whose time of death had been called hoiusr before. [smell alike a small animal had crawled in here amd died and by the look of his clkothes, and the feral snarl of his vfeatures, that animal was him ] 'Get some bloody clothes on,' said Davey. He threw jeans and a hoodie down beside Tony. Tony stared at them, and the frill of red football shirt the raw bacon in their sandwich, and to his own furs. Despite the shirt's colour, the clothes he had on were bloodier. He gazed at Davey through the hot-air-on-tarmac waver of not understanding. 'Jesus,'; said Davey. 'You smell loike your wearing a tom Tom.' Tony couldn't bear to think of himself as less intelligent than the man before him, but he ws just cleever enough to know he was. His head ached, filling with sludgy doubt. Now he knew why itw as called 'thick'. Eureka, he thougtg, I',m stupid. As far as epihenies went, this left him underwhelemed. Davey gestured with a the barrel of the gun, a shorter action than pointing, but more pointed, and Tony put on the apparel, fitting the furs both under and over the jeans and hoodie, for insulation. Gradually, he felt heat return to his limbs and , with it, a sense of his own humanity. He stood, clipping the edge fo te sink with the back fo his scalp, swore and stuttered forward with his fett, staring at his hand. Itw as unbloodied, which made a change, these days. 'Come on Miss Confidentaillity, stop being a klutz and come with us.' The men were armed with rifles and handguns, and carreid jerry cans in their spare hands. 'Door' said Johnny. The lader of the line fo five pressed the green button, and a lock deep in the wall c,licked. (Tiony had, since the emergence of the tumours, come to thinking of the walls as having guts,a nd organs, an dof staring at him.) The door opend and they left the theatre, the woman kissing each in turn but for Tony. Joanne didn;'t kiss him. She had moved,a s Johnny stroe passed, a sthough to embrace him, but had drawn away. He hadn't stopped. She didn;'t reacvh for Tony. Behind him, the last man in the line closed then deoor and it clicked once more.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Tony felt sweat on his skin, but at least, this time, it wasn't cing. It crossed Tony's mind that Davey had probably saver dhis life. He would've thanked him. If he didn't want to kil him. The men before him kept their gins at eye level, moving them as they moved their heads, in extension, as if they had played too many computer gameds, Call of Duty, Operation Desert, The War on Cancer. The man at the back of the line, behin d Tony, vlipped his lame heel and Tony staggered. Ten,na didn't apologise and tony felt the phrase 'Surovval of the Fittest' reel through his head. He realised Death wasn't an Ewual Access building. The disabled could just skip right in. They hadn't left him in the operation theatre, hwoever, probably because they thought he might, maybe, have the strength to kill one fo the woman. Well that was soemthign at least. Tony took this as a voyte of confidence. They wer going down the strairs, the resy fo the line straightforwardly, Tony crabbing sideways. For the first time, the red of a football strip suited him. Down, down intot eh dark, liena bucket into the well in Moria. Tony could have jheard thew drums, if his breathing was not too loud in his ears. Before him, the light from their tortches, masking taped to their guns, swere shotting stars of yellow in the pitch. It would have been quite the display if Tony's terror had allowed him to concentrate. As it ws, couldn't help but wait for what Johny had termed the Hot Spirngs, and for the cnacer from the Other Place to 'lan in and take him. M<aybe, he reckone,d that's why they had brought him along on this particular picnic. A honey trap for the wasps. They were going to the generators, to siphon of what remained in the main, and the first backup, for twhat the theatre;s used, the second. It would buyt them time, Johnnny had said. For what, Tony had wonederde but dared not say, a longer death? The door to the basement floor tutted as it swung to and fro, seeming unable to pick which way it wanted to be, open or closed. Nside the remaining working generator could be heard, rattling, ti mechanical insnnards huyrtling about inside its shell like a heart having an attack. 'Please don't fuckign break,' someone could be heard to say, By the sound of their strung out, whining syyleables, they might as well have been talking about their mind. 'Please.' 'Right lads,' said johnhy, his voice hardca s obsidian in the dark. You could 'lan on it. You could believe it had the stretgth for them all to start again. Just them , despite everything that had come before, if Tony ahd been an ape, he would have worshipped before it. 'Let's get at it.' The atmosphere in the basement had all the ambience of an alleyway beside a night club, and more death than an alley could hold. The echoes of the last generator's clanking rebounded from the walls as though the bricks would rather crush to roolom out of existence. The fleeting, strobing of flashlights and the electrical neonish glow from the generator and the wures that had been restrung to supply the operation theatres made the space insulubrius. Like detritus, deathw a sunderfoot, and so,mehwat beforshin. This seemd to be where all the rats in hosipital had come tod ie, as though the pied piper were the boiler and its dyspectic clanging the kind of pipe tune rodents would like. 'Ra\\ts,' said Davey. Somehow he invested the words with the bile he carried in his nomrla vocabuloary, with the vehemence of an ;arsehole', the stridence of a 'prick' the bristle of a 'cunt'. Benath his furs and furr-hidden trainers, Tony felt the body of a rat pop, putrificence finding its way to his heel in a line. He was glad of Dave, tne, for the first time. 'Jesus,' said Irwin. Johnny ha dwalked over the rats that'sappeared to have scurried down here, to the last accessible heat in the building, and were compacted up the edges of the generator, to knee height. As Johnny had walked, the chittantous sound of bones and other craetues could be heard, cracking unseen in the morass. Tony could only guers that where the rats went, the cockroaches had followed. 'They'll still be some alive under theer,' said Solksaer. 'I saw something move,' said Irwin. An explosion, squealaling and squeaewking and amound of whatw as now the carept to this room,. A shaggier pile than Tony ahd ever hoepd to feel underfoot, shifted, lurched. 'Leave it,'s shouted Johnny. 'They'll be happy enough eating each other. Just don't put your toes in their mouth. God knows what nasty diesaes they have.' 'Christ,' said Irwin. 'I'm more worr4id about them putting their mouth ion my toes!' 'Come on,' said Johnny. He as bent, crouched, now, jerry can in hand, beside the generator thatw as not on. Swaying on the covering of rat, In the alleyway light, as he worked with his mouth at ten fuel pipe that led to it, he had the look of a drunken woman whow as giving away more of herself tha she hasd planned, at the end of along nght. The night was nothing, thought tony, if not long. They were lal giving away more of themselves stha thet ha d to give. Johnny gagged as ten oil came up, and spitting and gagging into himself, he managed between spits to hiss. 'get it in the bloody cans.' By the lack of splatter on fur, he didn't vomit, and Tony had an image of the man they called Cantona as a wall befor a rising see, grey and virulent and storming, ut he simply wouldn't let it in. He could see why they stood behind him. Why they choose him to lead. To their deaths, added Tony. He wasn't going nto be led anywhwre of", "label": 1}

In their corner was Irwin, towering over him but slipping on the spine fo a rat. He ahd been atsked with looking after him, stick close, Tony could imagine Jonny saying, he's a slippery one that stuck up twat, slippery as a rat. Irwin was close to falling, his rifle was no longer pointed at Tony back, but had gone sideways, a stick to keep him standing. Irwin had given up on the idea of walking, it seemd. Tony's left leg was wrapeped in denim and fur, a starched hook. He extended it toward the giant. Ftom stage left. Exeunt Irwin. The generator mewled as it palsied, then mumbled, then hissed. As the lights along its diodes twinkled like those in a punched cornea, a heat rose from the walls. The rats underfoot shiofted, making for the brickwork. At the edges of the carpet, they could be heard squeling, as soemthignint he brick made, also, for them. Still the rodents, alive in the ehat of their decaying brethren, pushed toward the warmth. Irwin staggered. 'There's soemthign in the alls,' said Davey. 'It's beyond the alls.' 'Who said that?' asked Johnny, queroulous, the sound fo lips trying jard to hold them selevs together,a nd nto scream, let along holding together his Red Army. Tony didn't speak out. H ecould hardly believe he had just done so, not with what his left foot planned to do. He ticke dit behind Irwin's andkle and twisted. With a huffing oh-bloody-hell kinmd of sigh the ma went down, then with sound of breaking bones. Countles, toiny breaking bones. Tony ran. There was a scatter of shots, like gravel hurled at the inner ear, and torchlighst swarmed across the walls of the basement, line sof yellow followed by thr sharp stichwoirk of shots, like wasps with thei stuinhgers jabbing. 'Hold fire,' shouted Johnny. His voice had rsen and fallen to Tony's eharing, as he dashed intot he stairwell and left and up and left and uop and left and up. His left leg was torque that skowed him, threatened to flip him, but he swuing the leg fervously. The doors below opened as Tony made the second floor. 'I'm get you you bastard.' Johnny. By the sound s of it, his lips had burst apart, and hung, like his sanity, gaping. 'You bastard.' He took the steps two at a time. There were silhouttes in the wall. Got to get to the Other Place. Got To.Got To. Got To. The thoghst acme quicker than the steps. Johnny was catching, and would soon catch him. Through the dsoors to the third floor. YTony would have jumped at the sight fo the cat hising and running across his front foot, but he could spare the momentum. Yorkshire cat, his mind managed. Good sign. Silhouttes were in the walls; of trees and children and conjoined bodies. The Other Place was near, as near as it was goiugn to be, but Tony needed the lifts,. But he wsn't going to make them. And Johnny was going to get him. Got To. Instead, hwoever, of getting away, he got to coughing, bent into himself, into his arm and his hand, and hacking thick metallic liquid into his pakm. In the red light from the all it looked like blood. Johnny exploded into the back of him, turning him like a terminator against the nearest wall. Tony could hear soemthign in it, a am liquid, monstrous, tentacled life form that knew human flesh all to well, because that was where it had come form an dwhat it fed on, and then felt the warm rush ' a spine rtinglign relief- of Hot Spring up his heels, the backs of his knees, his buttocks and back. The panting of te predator, he thought. Johnny was in his face, Johnny' spown seemd to consist of several parts, techntonic plates of snarling, all msimashed one against eh other, everuthign grinding, and nothijnbg moir' so than his teeth, and screaming about killing him, perhaps, but Tony couldn't hear because he he was slamming him against eh all and the hearing and the breath and the sight was being knocking out of him, slammin g, S;lamming Not slamming. They were falling through. Wet, tumourous fingertips slicked across his forehead ' he saqw them snap at Johnnys right cheek, amd miss, but for a line gruel like that which agd come out of the stepped upon rat- anf they were insunlight. Flash, as quick as a camera, or that of a hydrogen bomb,a ndf then shadow, staring up at the undergrowth and, more pertinately, Johnny's snarling face, and, closer even, his hands, which YTlony could feel about his throat, thrortling. 'Stopm,' eh treid to say, 'stop' look. But his eyes did enough, as far as he could see, because Johnny did so, and stopped strangling him. The man they called cantona flopped back, fish like at the end of its struggles and stared up at a canoipy that extened so fdar upwoard, it might as well have been a new sky. Tomny hacked. Coughed. 'You didn'tm' he tried.' He rpeated the actoosn that had gone before. Smelt blood on his chin. 'You didn't breath in the sunshine did you?' he asked. Johnny tunrdd to look at him. His body and face were near, closer now hat his chin was tunred, and there was vulnerability in his eyes, as though they had been intimate in ways other than trying to kill one another. Lookignat him, staring into Tony's eyes, Johnny began to laugh, and he to laugh as he looked away, and didn't stop laughing until he heardc what Tony ehardc some time before. The sound fo screaming.

No vapour rose from his mouth. Instead, all of the world benmeath tehb canopy was a miasma. He felt, if anything, his greathne should provoke bubbles. The heat was a drowning, the forest a bath in which he was emerged head to toe, and not from the chin,m but to the scalp. He almost couldn't breatje,a nd had to call time on his liuaghin. Johnny seemd to sober at much the sam ertime, It took sioen effort to push air against this oppressive heat. And., fo course, as ever there was these days (and it had been some time since Tony had been able to use that idouim, some time since it had been anything but night) . Johnny wa sup before he was, facing the screams. They had a particular pitch, ridsing then rising before continuing to rising. There was no eam to them, only the scree 'scree scree scree' And Tony became convoicneced they were, in fact, squeling. In the earshot of such insanity and pain, particulars became important to him, he didn't know why. They had been ever since the sun went out. They were walking. Tony hyad increased his pace, not to meet Johnny's, not to be in simatico, but because both were striding at the edge of their gaits, and Tony on the iother side of his strides dfeghe ' continuall7y trippin g, sty=umbling, then hurrying once more. They quick setpepd to the beat of the scree's. The watery, wavering nature of the air didn't impede them. It dragged them forward and before long they wree aware, somewhere in their knees and hips, that tyehn land was descening as though toward a drain, or a plughole. They were being washed down with it. To the sewer, thgouht Tony, like two more rats. Ahead, where darkness should be, there was light, It was a wound in the forest, the sunshine as bight as fresh blood from a gouge, and beating in a kind of visual coronary. Ton shielded his eyes from above, as if about to face a Giorgon. 'Stop,' he said. Itw as hard to say this ' against eh scree's and the press of the atmospjhere- but harder to act it. Slowly, he did. 'Stop,' he added, and, at ekeast, Johnny slowed. 'Don't go intot eh light. I did once' and' Don't go into the light.' Breathign was rapid but heavy as bouldetrs in a stream. There ws soemthign else. He was reluctant to discuss the tumours nestled like cuckoos in his lungs. Johnny stared at him,. His eyes were green as a football field, after it had cut up , maybe used for rugnby. There had been heavy passage therin, wear and the coccasional tear, far bck in his childhood. He nodded, and they heard the scree-ing once more,a dn went to ground. Scampering forward on aching haunches, Tonya nd Johnny closed on the clearing, hiding nbehidn trees at its edge. There were no bishes. The clearing ahad been burnt out, as a bug at the enmd of a magnifying glass, and there hadm't been buishes here, Tony supoosed, for eons, or forever. Insteda, broken blackened, lizard scaled trees leaned as though brun victims on there way to dying. In the centre fo the hotspot, of the smudge mark of ash, were two black ncloths. The scree-ing had stopped. The black cutouts of ' yes, it was silk, thought Ton y, had the shape, from the side, of two segmenst fo a plug, or wedges in trivial pursuit, yoru specialist subject; torture. Cauhht like scarsp of meat too swollen to go down the drain was the six fo s=tumours, what ws left of the two of tumours (a new one of tumour), a golden carrauge and, on it, the Candy King. The Cnady Kingw as smoking, a cigarrtess (Tony guessedl; Superking) jammed to a rent hole that was his mouth. The Candy Kign, now that he saw him, was a playing card but tall as an ogre. Visible above the curve fo golden handrail on the golden side fo the golden carriage, the top half, crowned, was the face of Johnny's father on ermine ruff. Puff, suck 'The covers, please two.' Said the king, staring at the cigareete reflectively. The card, at its edegs (two florets of blobs that must signofy tumours, and a k, which dribbled a tear of blood from the kick pof the 'k') oscillated to the passing of a force om the other side, not the wind, but something tentacle and slow moving, but when the King turned to view his footmans progress to the cutoputs of silk, thew reverse of the card was but the Candy King again, in exactly the same pose, smoking. The half of the two tumours rested a hand on one cloth and pulled. The other cloth sobbed, once, as it did this, twitching. The first pull revealed a rose that had once been pink. Now it ewas black nearly all the ay down. In the sunlight it began, for a umpteetnth time,m Tony supoosed, to shrivel and smoke. He thought he caughta glimpse of pink, dep in its folds, curled in the foetal curling up of the petals. Maybe. Maybe he didn't. The Cnady King cackled then began to cough. Blood dribbled out of his line drawing mouth. Puff, suck, cough, bleed. The footman, his heavy cloak causing sweat to rub both his necks into rawm, asddles ores of red, walked to the other cloth, and plucked it up, as a magician miught reveal a dove, instead fo a cooked pigeon. This was the wrong way round howevert. Whatever was under the cloth was more than overdsone. A crisp would have thought it burnt.

'Ah, so, little piglt suck, cough, blled crackle(this from the pig) 'when that rose burns through, your precious rose, all the alls of the other places will come down,a nd I'll force my way through.

A young voci,e high, girlish, a giggle before it got going, 'Yes, very bog, yes, hee hee.' The piglet screed into the pause of thr Candy King risiong, the two of tumours iopenign the carraihge door, the Candy King steeping out onto what had once beenm aforest floor and reesemvbeld now the floor of one of the cirles of hell (one with fire, thought Tony). The bottom half of the Cnhady King was upside down and smoking just as he did. Itw as a gir;. It was Dr Amin;'s girl m Sabah. Shje seemd to be enjoying the cirgatees. She also undulated to thye movement fo soemthign that pressecv against he card skin, her brown, black 'lined hair. Tony didn['t know how the card move. It didn't w;lak., nor dfod the bottom halfSabah presse her hands down and perform a hand stand. Insteda, whatever force worked on it, propelled it, like the lady across the lake, the tumour across the skin. 'Cancer,m' said the Casndy Kimng and his Sabah half nodded in agreement. 'When we come thoruhg tot eh other place, tjhey'll be barely any human s ledt and those that are we will feed on.' Scree scree scree. The piglet dribbedl some fo his fat, bubblimng, onto the forest floor, where it further flamed a black l;eaf. 'Cancer,' said the Candy King. 'Is the next bohg thing. The humans haven't worked it out, not yet,. But we are the next step in the evolutionarey process. The fittest. The step up. Where humans end, we will take over.' Yony crawled around astump, over to Johnny. Johhnnny wasn't moving, nit even his eyes, they stayed flata dn heavy on the ;pig as two green corpses. 'Johnny,' whispered Tony. He had to do so again,l and a little louder, and the six tumours turned in its harness, but couldn't twist away from the carriage. 'Johnny.' Johnny looked at him. 'You were smoking.' 'Cuyt some flesh from the pig then,' saiud tynje Candy King, int eh background to Tony's whispers. 'He looks done just how I like it.' Johnny was starinmg blankly again. His minds off witht eh dandy lions, thought Tony, and the fashionalble leopards. La, la, la. Tony's own midnm knew how it felt, but he kept the whisper going, soothing to himas the rustle of a brook. 'Yiou were smoking and you had a lighter, this palce is fit to go up. I can't leave him here,. Cooking in that sun. We have to burn this place o0ut. I know it will kill thepig, but it will bbe quicker.' 'Out of the frying pan and into the fire,' mouthed Johnny. 'Yes,' said Tony. 'But the fire is quickert. It will get things done.' Johnny ndde, and pulled out his lighter and clicked it ('no'' hissed tony,. Trying to get to 'Not yet, but getting nmoweher near it.) 'a nd light the tree before them. 'Noshit,' saidf Tony,. Instead, dn backed away. Eating, the Candy King yhad returned to his carriage. There, beyod ht esmoek nthat now rose from the bark before Tony,. He could be seen to bend, and solictisously, to pick up something, to stroke. As the smoke forked in an updraft of heat, Tony saw it was a cat. In the moment it took the Candy King to look up and see him ' and Johnny- he saw that it was the Yorskhire Cat, and that the Yorkshgire cat was smiling. 'here's my loittle ace in the hole,' said the Candy King. It seemd a term fot eh felin, but the Candy Kign was looking at himas he said it. Tony didn't loomback, as he said 'run.' By the sound sof it, nor did Johnny.

The contact of biolidng together, even if what they built was less the den it was supoosed to be, than a jenga pile, redady to collapse with every pull into position.

More than once, the whole climbing frame of wood looked as though it would rather lie down and succumb to the condiotions, and the two men had to pin it back up against the tree that supported and anchored it.

'We have to go back to that black Mercedes.There's a woman trapped inside. She's hurt.' 'Black Mercedes.' There's a pause. Tony gains the impression its not from the recalling, but from BBC holding himself back. It reminds Tony of the way his brain blacked out segments of his stumbling about the moor. Redacted swear-words, perhaps. 'All the way back there? In the pitch black?' Pause. Redact. 'We can't just turn around on a motorway.' You fucking fool. Tony sinks back into the seat. 'We can't just turn around.' Pause. 'There are cars behind us.' Pause. 'We can't.' I wake with my cheek pressed against bristling, scratchy fabric, thinking 'hair of the dog' and wondering if I am drunk. The rough burrow of my throat lets me know I haven't been drinking. I feel wheels turning beneath me. I hear Tony say, 'The radio.' As with much of what he says, it sounds like repetition. He's a writer, everything is carefully edited, I think, not uncharitably. He used to be funny. 'Let me out,' I whisper. I raise my hand and banged at what must have been his seat. It wasn't really a bang, but a vague, wafting whap. The hand, seen in the slashes of orange motorway light from above, is strange to me, an albatross chick at the end of my arm. Awkward and uncertain and failing to learn to fly, it falls to my side. It manages another attempt at flight, a clipped hit of the upholstery, then falls again. Once more. Fall. My consciousness is dragged down with it. 'Are you alight?' 'Yeah, she keeps flapping about,' replies Tony. He stares at Tony then nods as though he's answered the question. His name is Call-Me-Nige and his face is covered in carefully applied plasters, giving him a cyborg complexion. Why anybody would want to be called Nige is a question that doesn't concern Tony. Why isn't something he's gotten around to thinking, not yet, not until the temperature drops by ten more degrees. For now, it's Who? And, Where? Who tenderly covered up his wounds, and where are they now? Call-Me-Nige is sat between Tony and the woman BBC brought. For now, he's talking about another Where. 'Yeah, the Hills,' Call-me-Nige is saying. 'It's closest. Research hospital. Cancer, like. But it's the closest. Yeah.' Tony looks past Jo's recently flailing head and out of the window. He thinks, there shouldn't be stars at this time, it should be twilight. What would they call it now the light had been taken away. Twi? Call-Me-Nige, of all things. He snorts and Call-Me-Nige shies away. The CX smells of blood and something bitter, Tony hopes it isn't chicken-woman's brains. Call-Me-Nige shifts back. It's crampt on the back seat, and another survivor is sat infront, in the passenger seat. Tony can see little beyond a ear coloured in orange by the few lights they pass, and can't rememver them picking him, or Call-Me-Nige, up. He wonders if he's fallen asleep without noticing. Call-Me-Nige's leg is pressed against Tony's own, but he can't move away, not with Jo. 'Move along mate,' whispers Call-Me-Nige. 'Eh?' 'I can't,' says Tony. 'My wife's here, mate.' Call-Me-Nige doesn't press the question. Tony feels BBC's eyes on him, in the rear view mirror. 'Could you put the radio on?' says Tony. Call-Me-Nige's legs were parted, jutting, as young men do on the bus, to discourage fellow passengers. On buses in the morning, Tony resented the driver stopping. As a writer 'with immense promise' Tony liked to set himself apart, which is difficult when pressed up against the muscular thigh of Call-Me-Nige. Tony's leg cramps, and he shifts impercibly, and Call-Me-Nige's muscles follow. I might as well sit on Jo's lap, Tony thinks. 'Uhm,' Tony clears his throat, tasting bitterness. 'Please could you turn the radio on. It's my bloody car you know.' It wasn't, but who was to know? It certainly looked like it was, given his Teco jeans, bad haircut and copper-rusted glasses. Jo's elbow is an imposition in his back. The world is abruptly digging in, all stares and joints, apart from BBC, who only glances. 'The radio?' Tony says. He sounds sorry, to his own ears. 'Keep her awake,' says BBC. His eyes glitter in the rear view mirror, dirty as iron ore (and orange under the lights), shot through with hardness. Joanne gives him those kind of looks. Momentarily, he thinks BBC is talking about her ' about his wife ' before realsiisng he's talking about her ' about chicken-woman. Can't Call-Me-Nige do that, he's closer? he thinks, but doesn't say. 'Don't let her fall asleep,' adds BBC. For show, Tony, cricks his neck to look behind Call-Me-Nige's massed shoulders. Chicken-woman has slumped against the seat, potato printing it wet. In the lights, the pressed blood is the colour of thick, dehydrated urine. That's what the smell is, think Tony. He had suruptiously pressed his palm to the crotch of his jeans. He hadn't thought the apocalypse would stink like this. 'If she falls asleep she could slip into a coma,' says BBC. 'Come on, darling,' Call-Me-Nige shakes chicken-woman. 'Uhmmana,' says the woman, or something like it. Tony isn't listening. 'The radio,' he says. With a twitch, BBC turns the dial. Radio four crackles to life, the channel of the Stones' choice. Marriage has made everything about them old before its time; most especially their marriage. Radio four says, 'We go across to our studio. Hello Simon... Hello' Simon'' Tony hears a bang. Following this, there is a weaker bang. Not long later, there is the whap of a bang that is going out with a whimper. It is coming from his spine and he freezes. Tony tries not to turn. The freezing helps with this. Something must be caught under", "label": 1}

Along with this, what they had seen, an dthe fire that could be heard raging deep in the basin of the fiorsst, and the soun d of the hunting horns, had bought a kind of kinship between them. Tony felt jealious, for a startling moment, of Davey. 'That will have to do,' said Johnny, a grint more than a short sentence. Tony nodded, unable to do anhthign but agree, throat too hoarse from smoke and running through it, and pushing through his fear, to manage more than an 'aye,' which sounded like a lie, in his spouthern accent. 'Through we go,' he added, blushing anf trying to pretend ' by scratching his forehead- that it wa s askin infection brought on my the tattoo. They gingerly stepped around the the den of twigs, stepping careful as a pig in a house of straw in a high wind, and then hefted themselves through the gloop of the hole. It wss like going for a dip in refgrigated moose. The cold enveloped them and gloope t th skin and they both curled, momentarily, hackinh at the air. Sn image from a amovie ' abyss- flooded Tion's mind. Of getting used to breathing water. Let it in. He thought, it wqa sequally cold. Johnny, it seemd, had been using the time he was bent dounbvle to stare at the floor. 'Can you see that?' Frtom the light, hung dranw and quarted by the wood as it was, that came from thourhg the den and then then rent in their realoity, Tony thought he could. A laqueer as though someone had paintakeingly painetd varnish on the floor, until it made short back fins of silvery treflection. 'Yeah,' he hissed. His luings knew all about painstakingly. He stopped coughing, started agi, the stopped as he felt blood in his mouth. He swlalowd,d glancing at Johnny as the latter bent to touch the floor. His fingers came up with a jelly-thick slime. 'Like ma slug trail' said Johnny. 'Soemthign this was has passed,' whispered Tony. 'What?' 'ket's go this way,' said Tony, pinting in the opposite direcytiopn to thte trail. 'Yeah.' 'And stay off the thbrid floor.' Johnny nodded. The motion was a bobbing of shadows on the corridor wall that reminded Tony so alittle girl ruynning between the railway slats of a fsilhoputte forest. He had been there and, therefore, she had been there, and therefore, he had walteched her being eaten by the Candy King. It followed, anmd it wouldn't be long, Tony knew, before th King found away through, a followed hi, sure as logic. Sure, eh thought, and stumbled away. ['Sorry about what David did.' He looked at Tony's forehead and by his body, his lamed leg. 'Soemtiems he just goes too far.' Tony did nothing more than look back, his lips falling apart, and kept doing so as Johnny turend and moved, starin g at air as he sucked it through his lips. Shut the door, he thought, absent as the memory of a lost parent, you're letting out all the heat.] The MRI in the adjoining room gave a lull hum through the wall, sounding for all the world like life mulling over how to torute Tony, now. It didn't take loing. 'She's full of it,' said Johnny. Like mother like son, thought Tony,. Itw as the kind of thing people would normally say about him., and by people he meant his wife, and by normally; all the time, give or take a 'you're fucking' and 'arsehole.' She was. The scanner, the way it was set, showed his mother in outline and orange through and through, like a gingerbread woman. The Candy King had caught her. There was not a spot of flesh left, all of it overridden, from one to another,w ith tumour, tumensecnet, filled like a potato with, thought Tony, potato. She was cancer, now, like the littler girl that ahd fallen from the roof. Aliev, nit because she fought tooth and nail, but alive because she had been taken over, right down to her toes, to the end of her fingers. He remmebred reading Misery, as a teenager in hus bedroom, around the time she had told him that the tissues he was using were better being binnede, and not shoved in the niches of his bed. He recalled Annie Wiklkes, how Paul had th8ight he could push a digit into her nostril, and he would encounter the doughy, but stolid, touch of something hidden, an unending Annie ness that went from one side to the other. And alien Solidity. His mother had been that way to Tony. Somehow, always, or at elast she had remarried, an opaqueness that caqme with step parents and a love divided, as though, at the age of eight she had turned from the light and he would find it hard to see through her, from then onwards, until noiw, when he could see everything, from one end of the skin to the othe, and still saw nothing but the same. 'Youw ere right,' said Johnny. 'About the Candy King. ASbotu my dad. About your mUm.' He paused. H ews working at a solid surface, one arder than the spaces just inside Tony's mother, insideher notrils, beyond the gap of her lips, behind her eyelids. Maybe, he ws only trying to force the words out into air as cold and unwelcoming as slate. Everything seemed to be grey. 'But my dad is the King. I saw that so your mum'' 'Mother,' said Tony, swallowing againbstt eh bile that rose onhte syllable, an unnesceery addition to the bitterness in his tone. '' is the queen.'

She lay, white as a dug washed parsnip, and just as much a vegentable. 'I have to show you something,' said Tony. Johnny didn;'t reply. Tony could here him gulp, then gulp again, and again, like someone tryin g to dislodge popciorn in a m,oveie thetere. The real chioking was yet to begin. He followed when Tony left and walked to the staitwel, and thourhg the doors, and up the srtiars, to the sign which read 'Level 5'. [scene with the doctor carrying his daughter to the roof, but also on the syringe containing the ssafeguarded polonium , and his inabiolity to go throughwith using it.] There was a klnock and I stiffened. The door, by contrastm, semed to waver,a s clothn in a breeze, and my gut formed a little space, small but widening, as if mimicking the thoguth of the door breaking open, and letting what was without. Come within. I wonderd, too abstract tyo care, if the developing hole in my guts was being cleared by a bowel movement. Knock, knock. I never remembvered joke,s but one came to mind, now, as though my survival was comical enough for the universe to join in the mirth. Knovk, knock,]# Wjo's there? B B who? I'm not scared. Well, of course I was. Whow as I kidding? The kncking repetade and went on for longer, alomng with shouting, as though theerw as s ectreet knock and a codeword and then thing outside lknenw neither because yit eas a thing that came through thr ewalsl,s and was, moe importantly, a thing. Irwin shifted toward the door and I wished he wouldn't o that, but at elazts he kept his rifle poised liejm a wand, like Irwin believed a bullet could stop one of them, which was as much a belief in magic as anything, I supposed. His eyes were for the door, which wass the saamwe for all of us, but none of them ' Dsolkskaer o Irwin or the woman ' had looked at me for some time. In fact, since the nightmare of finding myself;f in Tony;s subconsuis, I had beguin to feel like I was slipping away, fading into a figment of somebody wlese,s dream, and not adream of any of these people. I ad enough abandament issues from chidlhoo,d therapy ad b=maed me at leats this aware, but self awareness was of little or decreasing use when the self was gently flaking apart. I felt as thoug I left a bits of myuself on the floor everytime I oevd, as if I werw a collage made of confetti, and so I stayed in the corner of the operating theatre and stop trying to meet people's eyes. Theer wass only so may times blanked stare could be given before it was better to stare at the floor. ASfter a while, even the therapy devise of rubbing my hand against the back of my forearms became little sue, even the pretending that somebody else was comforting me, as a man, I guessed, sat on his hand to make it numb and then masturabeted, caesed to raise even the goosebumps of p;lease that it did at first. 'Let us in,' the sound, unmistable of Tony. I felt myself draw back togethrr and straightened, and lifted my chijn and hated all of it. For too many years of our marrauge had I relied on him to validate my existencxe, my values, and too many tiem s had he failed to do so, or even to tear me donw. If only the abdanoment had only been in childhood. He, tony had taken my inner child and led it a merry chas,e hadn't he. Round and round the garden we go until here I was, disparreaing from the world, hios and my mother's barbed comments a wraith king's blade in my shoulder. And, eher my mind goes again, Why ared ghost's bad liars>? Because you can see right trhough them. Johnny';s voice firm and big, and not lyin gat all, Solid as the door should ( I would not venture so far as to say I shou;ld be), as he said, 'it's Johnny.' 'Johnny,' said Irwin, before the woman, a blush on his cheeks, partly of relief, and some of the soujndof it. He unlocked the door at the button, and Johnny then Tony fell through. I couldn;'t help the rush of blood to my own skin, rejuvantin g, the flower unbder the spring sun ,a nd all those sickenin g things, and I looked away so he wouldn't see how much I needed it. The cokmversationthat followed was vagiue and shadowy has though I was standing back stage, behind the intervening g curtain, and hearing only half the play., and all the applause in the wrong places, which is to say- there was none. Enter stage fright, I thought, with what little of my brain was left working, was left infristed. Davey: Johnny! Johnny: Davey, mate! Davey: Johnny, pal!

They would have looked, If' I'd been in the mood to notice, like slates woiped clean by what he had seen. To an extent, this was unsurpirisng. Tony was stood behind him, the tattoo on his head giving him the impression of being a devil on the the taller man's shoulder.

Then btherew as the well of terror in hgis brain, overflowing, black, toxic; if the rest of hid body felt weeak, this was where all the atwers had gone.

It had asixteen bit quality ' This World- as though an old computer game, a Doom, the orginal. Reality was not what itw as supposed to be, that weas sure, and Tony was finding it hard to connect.

{"text": "beat in frantic, snatching poumps, as though it could reach out through his rib cage and grasp the hospital by its collar; it's tiles, its sleeper-dull, slatted, off lightbulbs, even its walls. But his heart was alone. Every other part fo Tony felt he was walking thorugh a computer game, and like Doom, things waited beyond the wall,s for a misstep, perhaps, and like Doom he knew his eyes were jarring side to side, paranoid,a nd with everyu right to be. Unluike Doom, there was no gun before his eyes. The others in the line- Irwin, Solsjaer, Cantona, Scolesy- held them. taped to their arrels were torches, to sthat everythjinfg the spots (sometime circles, sometime ovals, cometime broken like bat-sugnals) touched seemed a target, an enemy. The torch-lights seemd as jump as Tony's eyes felt. About this, Tony couldn't help but think, they were right. They went down steps, down corridors, and down to the front, automatic doors. Unlike his eyes, these weren't doing any sliding, but reverbaeratde to the wind on the other side, as though a '[metal sheet] in '. [band name]. The sound boomed through the foyer, the vibration s of which seemd to have knoicked over most of the green. Plastic chairs, and one woman, who had bled from one nostril enough to cover several metres of carpet, up to the recition desk. The rectionist nbeyodn it had collapsed onto the counter, as though in despair at the unreal NHS targets set by the government. In her hand was empty bottle, brownm plastic a pond like filter to her fingers on the other side, making them appear to be floating, whiole the rest of her, the skin of her cheeks, her hair ina matted pool, had all sunk. And urine, thought Tony sniffing, below her high legged seat. He caught a glimpse of Joanne to his right. She ws aas white as those fingers,a nd as thin, and with the lack of light (bar the spots of toeches) she caste no reflection on the reverbaetrtaing double doors. The sound was concussive rather than percussive. He thovuthn it must be the lack of light, but the qwhite and the ;ack fo reflectiomn made hi think of vampires,. That'd be about right, he thought, recalling his bank balance. She had been equakly insubastail, back in the operating., her fin gers grasping ast him as bthe receptinists around the bottlre,es and aseemingto sliude around his foprearma dn wrists as though they wre made of palsti, in China, and were till there. He had nevr felt so distant from her. She had begged, hwoever, don't leave me alone, I won't be left alone, you canb;'t just leave me here to rott, and forget about me. So he hadn't, though inthis, as in everuything, like a pane of glass on the wind, he didn;'t have any choice. 'Open it,' Johnny said. The glitchy, poixelly backs of the men seemd to tense, to grow one poicel line narrower, to shrink from the walls. Tonytw a sremineded of his Doom, one of the first games jhe had owned, and the sinking seneastion of petrification, bvoth of fear, and of addiction, sat befroe the cmputer like a stone, gradually and incraesingly unable to move. He thought this was how the end would be. Johnny didn't repeat himself but walked to the doors,a nd began to pull the right side to the right. Words were unwelcome here. Above and before the door, The hills signage ws gone. Tony imagined it high in the penines, a philogical riddle for whatever came after humanity and their languages. A riddle with a dull answer. Before the door, below wheer the sign had hung, a snow drift had mounted, shiny back as an abdominable snowman, hunkered downa nd waiting fro somebody to steo on him. They would have to cloimb over it. The other men had joined Johnny, or worked on the left pane, darwing them liketeethn that had rotted into the gum, finding jams for the doors when they were open. The foyer fileld with air and wailed like a mouth which could not quite get out the sceam it wanted to. I've been wanting to scream for years, realised Tony. It was unfair to say; since he got married. Maybe; a year after. They clutched up the snow bank, hands shying from its alien cold. Outside the hospital was Anotehr Place as much as the Other Place had been. A landscape on a moon, but with oxygen. You could tell, because te oxygen was on the move, and at a speed, and weighed them down, until the scrambled, wet by sleet and chill as though carwling a hard concrete bank up froma reservoir. Te other side of the doors, beyond the summit of the drift was no place for thoughts, let alone speech. Anything tony amitetd, as with others, found someplace better to be within an instant, was blown away by the magnitude of the gale. From the scattered clutching of torch light here and there, harried acxross the sky, the clouds were low, like Mordor had gone too far and smoked out every part of the Earth, a,d not just the m\\Iddle. They walked, or staggered, sideays as much as forwards. Their plan had three parts, and a final aim. 1)Go to the mulit storey car park and siphon all the fuel from all the cars. 2) Return to the security offiuce not far from recetion and call for help. 3) Descend to the basement, and refuel the remaining rgenerator. The aim) Hunker down in the operating theatre and wait for help because teher was no way they were going to beat this storm alone. Of all thse, only thr last seemed attracxtive in the blasted existence that became Yony's body. Then this too twisted away, along with his name, until all he wanted was death.

The distance had stripped all he had of him, his furs, his layters, his skin, his decnecy, right down to the insanity that lurked beneath. He slapped himself. 'Never stop,' he said, thinking of a dyin g SeamConnery crawling across a floor uin The Untouchables. 'never stop fightikn g till the fight is done.' (If it had not been for the wind, from his frozen lips,m it would have sounded as 'Neber op, neber op iking ill uh ike is dun'.) The others were around himand pointing aroudn the corner that lead away from the prevailing tempest. They cronered this, and across iced, rginng steps,a nd up into em,pty atriums of the multi storey. Inside, there appeared to have been a mammooth bumber car tournmanet. Cars sat as skewed angles, many taking over several parking bays, especially weher they jad been flipepd, and the gale had shorn them of their rooves, or scatrerd tgeir sfaterty glass like droplets. Cannisters and jerrty cans came out of back packs in slow motion, fingers made tardy by the cold. They went from emngien to engine, and to the fuel caqps, unscrewing in labouref actions, as though releasing the lids of stubborn jars. 'Loosened it for you,' said Tony, to Irwin, who ignored him. Soon, several were full, and a glow fo satisfaction was lit in the group which meant Solsjaer accidentaly smield at him, when he was grinnign wildly, and showing off his collection of three cans. Tony blinked back unexcpeted tears' At a smiele? How far have I fallen? I'm bloody publsihed writer! ' and stared at the small, blue corsa. Our car. He turned, Joanne was nowhere to be seen in the crpty- shadfows of the car park. 'Jesus, what's that stink?' said Irwin approaching the fuel cap. The car was at the balcony fo the multi srtoery, its low bonnet protected ina way the range rover beside it hadnm't been. By the lee of the metal, slatted boundaries. The world ourtside rushed by the slats like a train of snow and the howl fo somebody caught under its wheels. 'It guckign pongs,' said the man, his voice muffled by its sleeve. Bad ,meat put into the freezer, thoguth Tony. That was the odour. Dead dog, he added, internally. I thoguth the dog had been a dream. A hallucinatuion caused by conscussion., A troip form his head falling againstt eh dashboard. 'It's coming from the trunk,' said irwin, starggered forward ina zombie gait, sniffing in twitching, disgusted actions, away and to the let, like JFK; he nasal equivalent of having to stare at an accident. Tony looed up, searching for Johny or Davey ' he couldn't remmevgr whyh- and he din't remember that he waas when he saw what was happening to the Hills. 'Jesus,' said Davey,. Who was behind him. Soemthing about Davey's lacj of swearing made Irwin stop and stare. The hospitalw as lit u;p Noit liem aChristmas Tree, despite the superfluity of snow, but like a light bulb. Or, thought Tony, thinking of The Shining, y Stephen King, liem Dasnny's call. It wavered, blazing like out so forcivbly it became a blare the ears could sense, a frazzle of sizzling mortar the nose could catch, a knowledge that the Other Said ewas coming through. It was either then windo or female sceaming sieevd through the air, also , which had stileld somehwat, like passerbu=y at that accoident, uanble to help themsleves. Tony culdn't. In places, like the filaments omjn a light bulb, pure light could be seen. In others, skin glabrous and slicked and crab-red, moving in in slow actios n that npalyed with the mind as did a paraleel train moving from its platform, ad n yours remaisn staiuonary,. It was didfficuylt to tell of the thingn they swa was miving or sucking their world into it. The sucking, at least, as a clue. Could be heard. 'We've got to get back.' 'The woman.' 'Let's get moving.' Thes, and orther manyly thin gs were said by the men, but Tony couldn't help but notice that Irwin was crying, ntoi with his eyes, that seemd frozwn by the wweather or byt eh sight, but by his nostrils in oing liknes of gruellish snot. Tony caught his bretahe and struglled momentaruily to let it go, inorder to take the next. Irwin was a giant fo man, in the col,d and the drak he seemd a hewn statue the storm and the apocal;psye had uncovered, a huiman the type of which had not been seen sinbce man developed luxuries, and niceities and manners, and all things soft and southern. Here, watchign him weep woithout being able to shed a tear, Tony though he might crumble, and be lost amid the rubble of the multi stroey, dust between and settled on broken safety glass. Joanne grabebd him by the shoulder. 'get fucking moving you pathetic arsehole,' she shouted. Unlike in the years of their relationship, it was exactly what he needed, and he did. Back down the toothy, frost as enamale, steps, out into the cold. Some of us could make it no further than kneeling, too tired to lie down. Lying or knelt, we moved no more, motionless as the populace of Pompeii. I wondfered fleetingly if ages from now aliens would uncover us at the end, coated not so much in rock or snowfall but in our own despair. I wondered what race would come next until I realised I kne.w I ad seen its king. Our face were caught in mid-tic, lips snarlinga sif to cough or retch, as though, liekm the Romans, nature had caught us out, trapping our expressions", "label": 1}
{"text": "forever, the wind had changed and brought with a priaptic blast. There was nothing brain bolingly hot, however, about the rush tha played havoc on the double doors pof the foyer. Itw as cold as alien fingertips, and as long redaching, clawing between niches asnd the rubvver sela of the door. I would have shrugged my shoulders and collapsed at the hopelessness of it all, but I couldn't move, and I was not alone. None of us could, intil Johnny raised a finger and pointed and saids to the background of percussion from the glass behind him, 'Irwin. Solsjaer,. Get back to the woman. Check they are'' He didn't finish. The music of the doors would not stop, andjarred against his words. 'Davey' Tony' Ewe'll get to the security room. The radio.' Tony. He didn't mention me. Tonyw a worming his way in, with his Hiugh Grant charm, his southern manners, his illusory charm. Didn't Johnny know writers were full of it? I knew I was angry because he had don e the sam ewithme. Made me think he was the one, when he was only one tosser amongst many. Men, I couldn't help but think. They were rising and walking passed the reception, toward the corridor beyond and right. I followed, feeling cold through to the centre of me, and hollow there as ice-rheimed caves, and bitter as though they bwere thronged with stalagtites of frost. It wouldn't take much for things ti crack on the inside. The corridor wasn't long, and then a right down another empty bar for the hand-wahsing stations (danistation',s with posters of pointing hand that looked disembodied uinder the torch beams, as though the things fro the other side were forcing trhourhg, once mor,e an dsuggesting that nobody walk past the basins with their soap dispensers without washing. It would only take a minute, the wording read. And think fo the lives it would save.) The doors to the security room were on the right of one and these (on the other side fo which was a water cooler which had burst its frozen pipe and now stood ina small ice-rink of its own, one forlorn plastic cup dawl;ing on it, like a teenager with thoughts of a skating partner. It was dented, and bowed to one side.0 The security doors were not locked, which didn't surprise me. Nothing ewas the way it ought to be. Inside, the jitterbug torch-circls/ovals lit banks off cctv screens that must have been actingon a back up supply. Theyw ere grey but on, like, it seemd, my eyes. Davey tried a phone, unhooking it from the wall and jabbing the buttons as though we were puttingout a cigarette on skin, fingers twisting. His expression was equally deformd, each time a light caught it, which was more often than I woul dhav e liked, optimally, and I could imagine him as a toruerer. H ehadc seen enough, I guessed, to make a good fist of it. I thoughtof their father, his and Johnny's, and the King of tumours. He would make an apt king,; a good fit. 'Nothing,' said Davey. He probably swire before this, in rhyme, but I had blanked this out, so usedc was I to hearing it. 'Computer,' Johnny clicked his fingers. Davey followed he sound and it came on, a blue screen, the atoolbar and icons. The 'e' on it circled, bringing uo a sandyimer that semed happy to be upeneded over and over, its picels of sand as neverending as a desert. On another screen, white dots did the sma,e in imitation of a blizzard, until I realised it was the only camera on the outside of the buildinbg that was n ot a dark-screen. Another view pointed o n the front doors we had left, moments before, with the snow bank piled behind like ayeti tensed and about to pounce, to break in. 'Fuckiong'' This time, it seedm. I had accidentally redacted the 'nothing'. As Davey pulled open darws and cupboards, lancing his totrchlight within (highlighting folded blue jumpers, black trousers, name tags reading in winks of suilver 'Daniel' and 'Kevin'), I could feel Tiony swelling. He wanted to speak. I had been around him long wenough nto know the jitter of his slight fram, the way it seemd even his head grew at the thought of having something important to say. Tony said, 'Try the longwave.' 'What?' Davey said. He hadn't sworn, I was pretty sure, but he mighta s well have. Even in the dark, his face could be read, ridges of shadow,a nd looming brow. 'The longwave. It's what anybody who's still out there, anybody in authority will still be listening to. You canm't hack. You can't corrupt it. If you broadcast, somebpdy will hear it, and the security services are always listening. If we still have a government, they be listening, one of them will be listening. Try the lonbgwave.' The ast wqas a breathless corking of his mouth, as though the line of speech had reversed direction and been xswlalowed back up. 'What are you,' asked Davey. 'some kind of spook?' He may as well be, I think. He's insubtaial as a ghost, as eeliable. 'No'' aid Johnny. There wsas the pause there in his voice, that opening, coming to regard Tony as someone to be respected, listened to. How many years ago did I make that sam e mistake? '' he's got a point' a good point. There, long, it's a longwave. I didn't even notice it- it's so out of date. Let's get on it.' Tony moved as thogh he would get thewre first, btu hesitated, allowing Davey in. I could feel the chess motions of his actions, the way he allowed the manc to re-establish control, let him have these moves. Later, Davey would wake up and realise he'd been checkmated. I looked at Johnny and knew just how. Tony ws angling for a best mate. Davey turned the long wave on. There was rushing", "label": 1}
{"text": "whine through the speakers, wasps in a hury, which slowed to a static crackle. Davey passed the micropne to Johnny. Johnny flicked a switch on its reverse and a red light glowed into a terminator-eye kind of life. 'Hello, hello,' he said. In the red aurobla he blanched, face goujng ads thin and lantern-long as that of the tattoo on Tony's forehead. His eyes weer pitch shadows- holes where coal may have been dug from. 'Hello. Testing.' 'It's on,' said Tony in his I'just;want'to-be-helpful murmur. Davey turned to him. Now, his expressionw as unreadable, but made me think of a serial killers lack of affect. Murderous, in its own way. He know,s I thunk. He knows a asnake in the grass when he steps on one, and he's going to step on you. Iyt was all I could do to stop myself laughing aloud, buyt then this sensation jhad come over me several times, and I knew to put my palm to my lips and grin into it. 'Hello,' said Johnhy. @hello, we're in the Hills hospital Something' strange is happening here. Look. I mena. I know something strange has happenede everywhere, but I think' I think the thikng that's happenimng here is why something strange has happemed everywhere.' Johnny moved the microphone away fromhsi mouth and breathed as though he had been French kissing it. 'Jesus,' he said. He heaved air and brought the microphone back,. His eyes staring at it as it came as though he couldn't stop the movement, and he was goingto have to go back in. 'Look, send people. Snybody you can. The police, the army, whatever. If you want to stop this ' look just send whatever you have. The hills, The Hills, hospital.' 'Hello,' said a hoel in the static. 'yes!' said Davey, punching his brother in the arm. Jihnny staggered butr smiled. 'Hello Yes, hello.' Tony could be heard laughing, high and wide lippe as a sun that had gione wrong, goine out. I grinned into my palm., gums wideingin until I thought I might accidentally swallow it. 'The Hills,. The Hills hospital did you say?' 'Yes! Yes!' said Joihnny, not able to sya it, as he was laughing also. 'The Hi' Yes!' 'We're sending somebody,' the voice int eh gaps between the static was laughing too, but now, I thought I recognosed it's tone. I thought of a lift. An intercom. 'Her;'s coming.' Theb laughter became a giggle, low and underminging, sapping that if Johnny and Davey. They kenw when they were being mocked. It took Tony a loon-laughing moment longer, buyt he quietened alonhg with everybody but the voice. 'Can you see him. He's a man. A man called Jack. You can rely on a man called Jack. He's your best defence.' A knight wearing white. The Jack of tumours. 'He's alreadfy there. You have a problem, you say. How is ut with you humans. Houston, you have a problem? He's there, now. Ding, dong. Will you let him.' I glare at the monitor I had seen, of the doubvle doors in the foyers and the snow drivcft beyond. I pointed. 'THERE!' I shout. I'm too loud for my ears and they redden and feel as if they are attempting to withdraw back down to my nape, which is proickling. The men are loolking at the monior, hwoever, and I neded to, because I couldn't see the Jack. 'I can't see him' I say. 'I can't see him,' said Tony,. Fear making amess of his cultured tone. 'I can't neither,'s adi Davey. Johnny remained silent. He was good at pointing, and did so now. Not at the top of the drift, but at the centre of it, beyond ten seal in the centerf of the double doors. 'he's herte, oh yes, he's here,# the voice on the radio was becoming excited, an dits reguister rose and fell in the dark, fingers iona aural blackvboard. He didn't have the voice for radio, but I hesiotated to imagione what his face might be like. 'Your saviour. He'll fight off the baddies. He'll lay them low. Your white knight!' 'Turn it off' said Johnny, as though to the others, though he flicked the switch hims elf. In the middle of the snow drift could be seen a black dot. It became an eye of black,. Then a cirl of black. 'It's coming out of the snow drift.' Voices. They, and whose they were, had become unpimportant. Only the widening circle. 'It's walking thorruhg nthe snow.' 'You know how hatrdf that snow was,' 'It's waliign right through it.' I thought at least one fo the voices muist have beend my own. 'It's a visor.' It was,a nd then a white gloved hand, reaching out of the snow and to the door. The pane fell in ward. From the foyer, along the corridor, through the entrance to the security room, the screech of its fall could be hear., amd the shatter. My heart semed to mimic it, framgemnetingto heart beats all around my rib cage. Another arm, also white, and a chest the same, and a back pack. A backpavk? 'It's a bleeding astronaut.' This was Davey. The 'bleeding' from his mouth sounded forced but so did th rest of the words. It was. The asytronaut stood in the grey of the kidle of the cctv cscreen, in the cntre of the reception, glowing white. Itw as otherwordly, its sheen, its slow m,ovements, the ay it walked as a zombvie might, triught he chairs, into the corridor that went the oither way, towarad the strairwells and the lifts, and into another cctv screen. 'Where's it going?' said Tony. H esounded oike a teacher who knew the answer. I didn't have time fior this. 'Just bloody tell us.' 'What's it carrying?' asked Johnny. 'Soe kind of gfun.'

Just ask him, that little' 'It's going to the opeartying theatres,' sawid Davey. His face, in the light of the computer monitor and then long-wave's diodes deemed to be carwling back from s is own mouth, as though it was given off a astink, a small, unwholesome hanimal had died in there. 'Yes,'sadi Johnny. Nodding with his lantern long head. He rose. 'Yes.' 'Look,' said Tony. The astronaut was at the corridor that ran to the operating theatres. 'We need to go after it,'said Johnny. If huis face were lantern long, his eyes had gone out, need ed more oil. 'We need'' The astronaut was knocking. Thick gloves moving backward and forwardc slow as though ti were doing so in deepst space. All there disbelief seemd suspended. On the cctv screens, it looked more real thanm all of them combined, as the candy king had. Now it's our time,. I rmemebred. 'They wouldn't open it, though.' Said Ton y playing the soothing, calm head. 'They're expecting us, aren't they, pal,' said Davey, driiblign enoughn bile I thought, to shiort circuit the computer keyboardc beneath his mouth. Tony, mouth fixed on huis face,m eyes on the monitors, didn't seem, to notice. He kept soft peddling his vouice, turn it ivcer like the wheels of a pedalo ona flat syun staiendd bay, calm, calm, calm. Trust me, mate. 'By the time we get there, they'll have shot it. It will be all over.' Coward. On another screen, they could see the operating theatre. Irwin rose, walked to the door. In the square of greu, e looked substantaily less talll than he had before. He put his hand on the handle, his shoulders relaxing with relief. Sd whay shoiuldn;t he? I thought. No hot sporings, waitingfor his leader, his commandent of the Red Army, his Cantona. He's about to be kung fu kicked where it hurts, I added, withoutn meaning to. On the other monitor,. The astronaut lowered it right arm and the gun that stuck from it.The door opened. The astronaut fired. Plume sof air soft soaked the corridor to its rght. Irwin soaked the operating theatre with a plume of liquid that appeared to eb oil, in the grey cctv light. Sojsear fired as his friend fell. The astronaut hesitated as though thinking about what it would liem for lunch, the continued into the room. There were holes in its suit. Nothing came from them. For some reason, I expected air. There certainly wasn't any bloods. I recalled the visor, and no hin t of anything beyond, and realised I should have seena face. Jack wssn't there, not corporeally,. As a huink of living tissue that could be killed. It fired at one of the women. I thought 0- I really should have taken the tiem to learn her name, as the side of her face was vloiwn aeway by the bullets of the gun. She fell, also, attemopting, it appeared, to screean, but losing most of the sound out of the worng pklaces. The silence of the cctv monitors made what would have been eerie, almost unbleievabel. Itw as then that I realied we should all be moving. 'This is real,' I shouted, hitting Tony because I didn't dare strioke the other two. They would hit back. 'Get moving. Get ion save them getm get, get,' I realisedc I pribaly sounded oiikke one man with adog, and din't care. Tony crioed out in pain. 'Get off me woman!' he yelled. The two men turned by gradiuents to stare at hin, slow as the astronaut, and as they loomed aeay from the screens, Johnny reeled up from his seat. 'Get the jerry cans, grab them, come on come on!' They were all runnin g. My feet felt hot as a rash beneath me and it was speradingm at a canter, across the floor, between,. On set of feet driving the other on, along the corridor, up the starirs, to the second floor, out throught he door, there was the sound of air released in ahiss - more bullets- and the staypuffed back of the astronaut, swells of Michelin man fabric backing out of the door. It turned toward us,. It's visor was smeared awith liquid, that, on it, seedm purpkle, thought eh spahse on its front were a cheerier shade of red, and crimson on its nASA badge. Davey fired and it rasiec its gun. At me. I6 fired. I'm going to die, I managed to think, which proved, at elats,. That the spopedof thought was quicker tajn hat of a bullet, but,. Somehow it missed. #'The cans' yelled Johnny, and he was behind it, as a mythological hero, thoug, instead of jumpoing on the atronautrs back. He glugged oil across it. Davey slid, letting go of the thought of being able to stand this, under the arc of the gun, and did the same to its legs. Then, as the atrinaut gyred , they skided away, further down the corner. Itw as then that I redalised Tony wss till in the stairwell, staring trhpigh the glass windows. 'Now, fire,' shouted Johnny. They emoited, each, a clip, into the Jack, which seemd to deflate it slightly, but not enough,until. Abruptly, a spark seemed to catch the oil, and the atronaut became a pillar of fire, marbel burning, salt ablaze. It glitted at its visor and lurhched, firing at the wall, which responded by developing holes. Grafually the flames revealed the nothing beyond the astronaut suit and the Jack sank to its knee, which, in turn, burnt to thoughs and then notihing, but the visor, lying on the charred corridor. The smell was burnt brown, sugar, burnt black.", "label": 1}
{"text": "The light from the operating theatre made a coffin of light in the corridor, in which the remains of the astronaut was a grave dug, but unfilled by anything but the visor, which, black in self, shone yellow on its right, as though it saw the sun rising. No such lucjk, Tony thought, unable, himself, to get up from where he had sunk, head cocked, almost in prayer, against the corrdior's plastic railing. Itw as purple, he was pretty sure, but he had begun to question whther colpoutrs meant what they used to, now there was so little light. If colours as a concept was dwindling, the rods inhis eyes shortening. With the light from the bulbs above the operating table, on them? Tony womndered, was the stenmch of blood mixed with guts mixed with faeces that had come out of holes that shouldn't exist and , more, he wondered,w a steh world liekm this, now. A braile of existence, but pussy, boiled up, lie marsh, as much a scratch and sniff as Braille, everything what it smelt like or felt like, amd nothing what it ahd been, under the sun,so much of which seemd to have been defined by what it looked like. And taste, thatw as another thin. Most of Tony's taste seemd to derive from, his nose. His tingeu hyad little say in the matter of what things tasted like. And, on top of this (an dwhat a heap of slef piyty that made) there was too little food, or food thatw asn't spam or baked beans, to make of taste anything more than apassing resemblance yto what it jhad been, as a passin passage to the gut. Joanne had been shouting inhis face. Get up. You pathertic, etc, etc, blah, blah blah. His hearing seemjd to hav e deciedd to go the ay of his sight. Of this he could be glad. Te gale outside, fro Tony had receded, though the snow could be seen at the sma ebreak flake speed, rushing passed the windows under the odd circle of torchlight, wherein it appeared orange as spots of dehyradted urine, or in the dark, where it had the lookm of moths, all desperate. It had been a long time since they hadca light to fly around, he guessed. They were probably like he had been, for the last thrre yearfs of marriage, drivem near mad with frustratuoin, longing, and what, he guessed, for them constituted a lack of sex. Get up. Do something. You pathetic, la,la la, who cares really. She and the words and their sound had utterly departed, in the end. Tanhnkfully, given, even he blanked her out, he couldn't her halotosis. It had always been that way with Joanne, and he hadc never gotten round to tel;linmg her.Residues of guilt an dhasame pumped his blood harder, until he recalled that he simpky didn';t acre and anymore and it sunk back into the thickened morass of his heart. It was never the right momenet. Either mid argument or later, when they made up. There ewas an delicate ecosystem to thewir relationship, argue/makeup/argue/make up, and the mention of how her breath smelt like she ad eaten his hope but forgotten to swallow, and it was in there somewhere, rotting away, felt as though it would send the whole thing into climate change meltdown. Climate change, he thought. He laughed, The sound was a broken croak. 'Cro-ak' his throat managed. Climate, change, try this on for size, you deniers. And yes, we did bring this on ourselves. Hee closed his eys and opened then. It wasn't the win, though he could never sleep through wind. The years since he had lpeft home were fileld with the sure knowledge that every house he settled in would fall down around hgis ears, at the merest hint of a gale. As if the big bad wolf chased Tony from city to city, hoping he would decide that straw was the best Garnd Designs choice, as though he coudlnt' make it in this big bad worl,d and all his designs would comke to nothing but rumble around his be, while he lay in it, refusing to come up out of the covers. No, it wasn';t the wind. He had let go of that, nor the gentle, slam slam slkam, of the helicopter aginst the side of the buiding, and not even the tremours that occasionally mafde Tony feel hr was on the set of Star Trek, and the entire building might go sideways, shields down, before combusting. Itw asn;'t even the sound of guinshot,s by which the positijn of Davey could be tracked, his veru own form of tagging, as he had been running and shooting since the astronaut and 5the death of the women. No. He couldn';t skleep because he was standing up., he has gotten up. He wsn't sure what itw as, her words or the stench of her braeath, but ihad gotten through his apathy. He guessed itw as the altter. He swayed as The Hills shook to its roots. He wwsas unsure how much more the suoerstorm it could stand but, well,m hey, it should stop being such a wimp. He was still standing, wasn;'t he, and look nat the shit he had waded through. He alked to Johnny, bent, grasped the side of his head,a nd spoke into his face. Johnny didn't flinch. Tony blinked. He had rather gambled on giving as bad breath as his wife, but Johnny, in a pool of arm,s and legs and a line of milk white dribble from his mouth, the coilour of the limb of a young, northern boy who jad never yet been on vacation. 'Johnny,' said Tony. 'John,' suad Tony. 'Jonathan.' That did it. The Cantona of a Redf SArmy, now, of two, looked at him, a flinch of eyes, as though the corneas had been slapped by miniature palms.

All the better to betray him, he added, in a voice that sounmdede suspiciously like Joanne'sw. Over the years, she had slowly no longer needd to be present to ofer a critique. Irtw as some achgeovement, thought Tony. 'You have to get up,m' he said. 'Get up.' Johny rubbed his face and, by way of his temples and foreheads and nose, his eyes. His expression was blurred by the passing of his hand,s unsure of what it should be, like a child waking and trying to decide why his father looked angry, Tony could have told,m him, and then did. 'You have to burn your Dad.' The tiles squekwed under the skin of her heels. Tony would haqve bent and wiped his forehead of the sweat that was shiverin g their, droplets clinging to his skin, it seemd, in nostralgia for the heat they had left behind. He would have bent but was alreadyu bent double, and not from carryin g the doctor's girl. He had been hun chbacked over for some time, his nerves set so on edge by the ex[losions o thunders and wind an dgrenades within and without the Hills, that he was one broiling living twitch. There were no more social niceties in his expression, passing a hand over it, as he did after doing so for his brow, he mapped out the contours of a an infernal terian, twisted and troughed by panic and terror that had squatted so long on his cheks an dlips that they ah dsome kin dof legval ownership[p. If there could be said to be alaw, anymore,e bar the law of natural selection. And if there is thiks, Tony thought, something made of human woiulod win out, but itg wouyldbn't be us humans. He dropped the girl head first against eh wall, and her scalp slouched down it. Te blood this left behind was invisible to an eye so used to being naked, to being without light. He could hear ten saquelch of her progress and his imagination which had stenmgthened in the dark, painted in the crimson. Tony knew his sense of sightw as dwindling, along with a sense fo what was real, but felt no comparative stremgethenming in any of his other senses, and w2as supposed to set in. Except his sense fo worthlessners, which had multiplied down here in the dark. Cantoan loomed closer. He carried a lantern. Tony wondered where he had found it, until he relaised he didn't care. His face was as oblong and leadenm as the lines around the lanterns edges.It looked positivcely victoiran. There as nothing positive about Johnny's exptression. But then he was about to cremate hi dad, and a father that didn't seem gone, his eyes staring up at the two men and twitching, foloowun g the light, as a wasp legs woul don a windowsill, after it had been swatted. Autonomic reaction, thought Tony instincelky, without pausing to consioderw aht this meant. Thoguth was beginning to have little relevance to him. He wqaas descending. Devolving, in direct opposition to the cxancer. It sounded aqs thougheh ws guloping. A she iusedc to do in the cinema, w=nervous, ona girst date, starin g and unable to stop, untiol he noticed th eupoturned jeery can in Johnn'ys hand. It emptied. 'Get you Mm,; jihnhy said. It coud have been a question. If it was, the leader of the two string redc arm,uy showed ;little interest in the answer. Tiony nodded (he didn't know why- it seemd the thing to do, though Johnny wasn't lookin gat him) an dturned. He found the torch I hiss pocket, brought it out and swun the lever around until the dynamo of the light flicked in. It had a sound somewhere between buzzing and whining an dhissing, but loud, like a mosquito that ahd fouind itself into his ear. Additionally, it didn't allow him a spare hand for the gun he had taken from Soljaer, a colt .45, which was stashed (like a happy-to-see-you he thought, and grin like a n elastic band being habitually stretched) in his left jena pocket. The safety might ajave been ofgf, it might not. Tony didn't seed much difference when the world was the way it was. How could a small clipm of metal offer safety of any kind? The buzz/whine/hiss of the light stoped him hearing the approach of Davey, of Scolesym, until he ssaid. 'Yiou going to burn him, eh?' TYony froze, his body and his hand. The lguth before him flickered out like a hope he had barely trealised he owned, now gone. He turned, and managed nearly to fall. In the circumference fo the lantern light that was cut at its edges by the chords of the hppitsl walls (didn't they look thick and finalm wasn;t that alie) Davey stood. He didn't appear to be anywhere near as tall as he had before. He held , in his right hand, a grenade, unlciped, his thumb keeping in, by the look ofn it, the pin. 'Davey'' something waass waking on Johnny's face. Fear, by the looks, fo it, thought Tomny,. Buit of alight sleeper that one. 'After all he did for. Growing up. He dragged uis kicking and screaming into this world. Made men of us.' The fear was gone. Scared off by something strong. It looked a lot like rage, though wearied, bled of its shouting. 'Really> Did he Davey? Where was mum, is that your next question? He made men of us with his fists, didn';t he. He made a runaway of her with the same.' 'Shut it, you two faced shit,' sad Davey. ;Bet you're burning them on the say so of that southern lying pomce, eh?' 'So what if I am?' 'That tattoo, bro. that tattoo, we oput on his forehead.

Chicken-woman is moaning, 'Mummy, mummy, what's going on?' and Tony feels a hiving rash of shame going up his nape. BBC's subtext is he ' Tony ' shouldn't have pushed it. As a writer, Tony is good at picking up implication. Yeah, when it's theee, Jo would have said archly. Th einplication being; you 're paranoid. He looks up, expecting Joanne to be staring at him, that cudgel look again, then away. He can even sense it, these days. Call-Me-Nige has a phone several models better than Tony's and is jabbing at the wide screen. 'Not getting through,' he says to the shadow in the passenger seat, as if they knew each other. 'Network busy.' Tony diodn't try to retrieve his phone from where itw as wedged in his jean-pocket. The extra hips he now wore around his belly, where once he had een lean, would have made te action awkward, and who would he pjhon,a nyway, Friendless, he doesn't bother with fs=acebook, and his mother his only family, was in hospital. Call-Me-Nige twists in his seats. 'Dog,' he says. Tony stretches his neck to peer around his bulk. BBc slows, clikig the left indicator on. They leave the lines of traffic wrggling around stopped cars, and roll onto the hard shoulder. The traffic continues past as lava, red taillights flowing abot dark, dead cars, some eating through the miles quicker than was safe. 'Dog,' says Call-Me-Nige, pointing. He joatles chicken woman, who moans. 'Sorry,' he says, 'But couldn't we fit a dog, on our laps.' Tony sees movement by the next exit. The dog from the car, as much loloping skin as flailing hir, staggering along cat eyes, red banner-tngue dipped toward the ground, as if it had been torn down. Tony sees that half of its face, its tongue, his lips, its left eye, and been scraped away. A car swerves and misses it, but continues Then, another. 'We have to do something,' says Call-Me-Nige. Between two other cars, the dog bknders then under the back wheels of a third. Call-Me-Nige's thoigh muscles bunch against tont's flaccid leg. The dog reappears. The leg doesn't relax. 'That's one lucky dog,' says the shadow in the passenger seat. Tony doesn't hear him, all his attention on the dog. Its head points, nose and snout lupine, mtoward a wrecked car near the central reservation. T can't make it, he thinks. Another car, beep and swerve, and it's past, and does, does make it. Tony's heart feels as though it might be trying to aspexiate him. 'He's right.' Tommy reaches across his wife, fumbling for the door handle. 'We have to save it.' The wheels of car shriek as they miss it. The dog staggers keft, Tony's left 't he wrong way- b ut thenright, and in a wriggling, worms in its rectum action, under the chasis of th wrecked car. Ony finds he can breathe, it comes as a surprise. 'Fucking hell, it made it.'ays Call-Me-Nige. BBC opens his door. 'Right,' he says. Both the action and wthe word are decisive. The wrecked car explodes. Momentarily, befor eh can cover his eyes, Tony sees, at the explosions hheart, a sunrise of light, and a line thin and black that has snaked its way to the dog. Then, both are eclipsed by flames. 'Shit, says Call-Me-Nige. 'Shit.' He says it a third time. 'Shit.' Not for luck, thinks Tony, luck doesn't deserve it. BBC releases the handbrake, and the CX starts to roll. They rejoin the traffic each of them silent, staring watching the traffic ahead, noen of them looking at the wrecked, burning car. 'I hate this,' Call-me-Nige says, needlessly. Ahead, as the road flattens, brake lights are stacked, red, gambling chits, making progress unlikely. BBC turns off when he can, not long after 'Stop At Starbucks' and their route unravells back and forth down the west slopes of the penines as thougn they were a thread unknitting the hills. They pass long stretches with only the headlights and Tony can't help but wonder if the dark that passed outside the windows was what would now pass for the world. After an hour or so, they arrive at The Hills. He walks. He supports his wife, her weight, by her right arm. He doesn't recall leaving the CX, though he rmembers waiting for the rest to leave. Pages of his experience have been ripped out, his memory a book redacted in swathes. Flick, and you'll miss it. flick, and he had. Flick. He's approaching the foyer of A and E.

{"text": "goes that's what he is, a snake in the grass, a devil, lying, wheedling, southern.' 'Shit, and'' 'And I'll kill him, if I ever see him.' Tony felt a dribble fo wetness in his underwear. Tahnkfully, itw as warm. He considered letting go of his bladder, but feared it would make a sopund. He palced a hand on his other hand, steading the shaking, taking care not to accidentally whirl the dynamo of the torch. 'Listen Davey. He- dad- he was the fucking devil. Not just when he';d hd a drink neither, and itw as rare enough to see him without a bottle in one hand,m us by the scruff o the necdk in the other.' 'He hardenede us, for this life.

And do you rmenbver what he did to that wee, little dog we found on the streets. You know the straving hungrey one. You cried for weeks afterwar. You wou;nd't stop pissing your bed, said you couldn';t get the blod off your lips. Gave yourself coldsores wityh the washing of it. Washign, washing, scrubing.' 'Shut up' shut up' he was making us'' 'Making us ready for this, Well, he didn't know this was coming, did he? And you talk about us working class rising up and killing the bankers whe the end of things come, take over the houses of parliament. Go back to when real men rtuled the world. Well, how did we do, eh? It's our end, just as much as anybody elses. Where did the preparation get us? Eh? Where's the Red Army now. We're a bloody red twosome, We don't even back a bloody gang.' Daveyw as shaking around the grenade. All that seemd steady was the brick of blacknes in the lugth. 'Put the pin back in mate and let's fin ish this.' Davey shook his head. It seemed a natural extension of his termouir, until the thumb came off the pin. Johnny satred at him. Tomny flinched and made to jump against a wall, sliding down it as the girl had before. He heard wetness, and felt liquid on his up lips, spreading to his nose-end as he sank, and by there, as it waas flattened, to his right cheek. The xplsosion didn't come. Davey's tremourijng continued, without losing nay of the shaking of his head, ito laughter. He bent and slapped his thighs. 'Bloody duds,' he laughed. 'Bloody Yugoslavian shit duds. Bloody fucking Serbian useless wankers.' There ws a crack, as though the grenade had farted, had given off a good one, and Dasvey collapsed to the side, his right armj gonme, arterial, blood where it had been before, making a crescent fo st katherine wheel like shimmers brefoe the lanterns, coated its glass, makinga shadow puppet play fo the wall. It rmenided Tony of when the cancer came thorugh. Davey was trying to scream, it seemd, without chheks of lips or even a jawline,and made a huffing, hissing sound instead. Tony rose from where he aa scrouched by the wall. Johnny had beguin to do davey's screaming for him. What was visible between the shadows of his face was making its own shadow puppetry. Devils could be seen through his paper wide skin,. Cahsing aeround his brain. Tony walked to Dasvyer, withdrew the colt from his pocket, flicked the safety off (it had been on, whichw as asensible precaustion he managed to think, when everything nhas gone to shit anyway, he managed to think beffroe hre put three bullets into Davey's brain. He looked down at the dead manc. He had thought he would enjoy that more., but thatw as where thinking got you, he thought. 'I'll get my Mum,' he said, ' and come back and light these two up. Then we'll go through to the other side.' Johny ha gone from screaming to whisperin g. Looking at what he could see of his face, it didn't seem to be him, anymore. 'No, I'll do that alone. I'm going to do what that doctor couldn't't. I'm going to shoot myself up and go and find that fuckin g king.' YTony satred at him. His lips made to speak, but he wouldn't let them. Don't. I'm sick anyway. I've got the bog C. Let me go insyteda. No. Nothing came out. Except hs eys, protruding. 'You can't let him do that,' said a voice. It wa sJOanne. Of courtse it fuckingwas. Sjhe was always there solmewhere was she, the more the darker itw as. Johnny rose and TYony allowed his head to to the smw, to come down in a nod. Itw as enough, perhaps, all Johnny needed, because Tony let him go, running past like a rash of footsteps. 'You know your'e ill.' Voice sin the dark. Her nagging mulpied. 'You can't ket him go on his own.' 'You're a coward.' Hands coming from the dark, zombie, puincing, pushing him to the wall where his blood stillw as. He tottered, uncomprehendingm a spinning top that would never fall. 'You're a coward.' He pushed back, harder than she had, harder than she couyld. She may be better than him, but he ws stronger. Therew s aclunk as what he imagined was the base of her skull it brickwork. He hoped it ws her skull. 'I'm going to find my mother and burn her alive' he said, ' if you don't mind. You never like dher anyway.' 'I ahte you.' It was bare as revealed fangs. He shrugged, and shrugged her hands off. @get off me,' he aid and began to run after Johnny. 'Leva eme alone.' Sjhe didn't. It took svereal stumbles ' along rather than up the steps of the stairwell- to realise it wasn't the buioldin gthat was buckling, but him.

{"text": "had softened, as thoyght The End of The World had bated its breath and was waiting. Waiting to see if Tony, perhaps, have the decncy to simply fall over and stop moving. For some tiem now, it had felt like the right thing to do. He stumbled. Either his body his brain was failing. He wonderd which for long enough to mistime a step and stumble again, and for him to know that wondering meant it was probably his body. I the end, which woiuld make little difference, and the end wasn't far away. He was in it, to an extent, his endgame as well as the earth's. Tony had alwsys thought they had soemthign specialm a talent, a writer, the exact distance from the right sized star to create an dsustain life. Now, tihout the sun, it didn't look so rosy, and he doubt wthether either of them had anything to offer the universe after all. Humanity, et al. He, his mind, his body, were undermined, all, as much as the storeys of The Hills Hospital above the third (and whatever red-light giving life-form undulated there). He flinched, as would a man walking through aforest in the dark, to the flick of twigs about the eyes. His teeth jarring together, the sjkin about the eyesockets tautening, his head flinching to the left. Away from the light jn the third floor. He was theer, now, and iutw asn't only the glare tat made him wrap[ his hands around his head. But her voice, goijn gon an d on. 'Here are you going?' 'You ahv e to stop jhim.' Voices in the dark Abnd, ss he passed the daoctors floor, again ' That's it. If you won't I'll go after him.' The flap of doors, and he was alone. 'Finally,' he whispered, but his lips were cracked and his throat sore, and he couldn't hear it. He went on, upward, and around, his head lolling like a ball that had come off its bearings. He felt lost, until he asaw seven. The MRIO room. His mother. He was going home. Intervening life slid off his shoulders, from hsin waist, off his hips, he stumbled as kicked it off hi feet. He felt anked as a nwrborn, going home, but not to embrace his mother. He ws going home to arsonit it. He held the last jerry can, in his hand, and the rewmainingmatches, no more tha a death rattle in their packet, in his jeans' front pocket. Throughthe door doors, the one on ther gith came back to clip him around the back of the head as his momenetum took him forewardc then backward into it, and to the side, besides which. YTour a pretty boy, aint you, and stipid. Pretty stupid. He grimaced and walked down the corridor which kiltered, going diagonal as a Star Trek scene. Mum was to the ledft. You're not pretty, you're not ugly, you're pretty ugly. And on, and on, and on, he thought, telling his feet to do so, when they would rather not. Te table before the mRI scanner was flat before hi, his mother laid out on it. He raised the torch. It slipped over her gowned body like an unwanted palm. He laid the light on the small table beside the scanner, next to a boxy machine that had done the best of its beeping. Tony felt. Also, that his time was running out, the tiking of it audible to him as the clicking of his lunbgs, as they levered up blood, spatuling it into his throat. Where he felt inclinmed to Cough' coiugh. He held his lips with his palm, took his hand away, and felt like he was still holding his lips. There was something ligh but presesnmt as two slugs on his sklin. He didn't hold it to the yellow moon of light tahgt shone form the torch to the far wall, but could guess it would be red as lipstick. He unscrewed the jerry can. Careful to leave it it mostly full, eh poured on as littlr eas he could to be sure of brunign his mother to a cinder. He dug into his jean's pocket and ferreted, hgis nails biting into him, even through thdenim. They needed a cut. Who gave a fuck? He pulled out a tissue, angruily. He wouldn't be needing that. Car keys. What was the pi9nt, he hadn't even locked it? AS debi card. He could laugh. There, at last, eh slid gfree the matches, opened the box. It didn';t slide but jerked, letting one fal to the tiles of the room's floor. It semed to clatter ther. For the first time, Tony noticed the lull in the storm outside. He bent to retirve, but it must have rolled under the scanner, somehow. He shrugged,a dn dug a finger in. he felt the ribs of two or three more. Brought the first out, crackloing it along the side fo the match box. It agve a brief flutter, like abutterfly in November, and that went out. He sniffed. He coulghed. And ignored the sound of drool splattering from his mouth, onto a soft fabric. He also ignored the thought that the floor shouldn't be soft. Again, the box, the last match, the draw, the strike, it hissed and rattled into light. He raised it into his mother's fce. Itw as so close, he didn't at first recognise her. His own mother. Then she ipned her lips, and mor eimportabntly, teeth to bite him and he jumped backwards,a nd the light went out. What? WHAT? 'What are you doing, little Tony. Coem to burn me have you? After al I did for. The nappy changes, the endless prattling. Oh you wnet on and on,' Tony backed away. His brain had very little to do with it. Not for the first time ,.

It smelt like he had died in there. ''You can be wheatever you want to be' Hah, and what have you wanted to be. A failure, by all accounts. Preteneding to yourself that your some kind of writer. How much money have you made from that, eh? A few hundreds pounds. Do you call that being what youew want to be. Soembody who has to keep coming hbacl, cap in hand?' They were in the corridor. The torch was ahead, and the head thatw as out there in the dark wouldn't stop talking. 'And that bloody awaful book I had to read, with all the horrible awful swearing. Cunt this, and motherfucker that' I can tell you, I had to look away every time. To think you call that art. Art!' The starirs, he thought,. Where are the stairs. The door to them should be at his back. Had he wlaked passed. He had nto get down the stairs. He had a flash of imge, of Johhnny's dad and the girl and the lighter Johnny had put donwn, by the all, when he was crying, sobbing, catatonic. To9ny felt himself walk into the wall, and felt like his heart had jumped into his lungs, the latter of which took to beating at the former's pace. But he knew where he was. Tonyleft his right arm fall, and traced he wide (it was lime green I remember, from when there were colours) dado rail, to the double doors of the stairwell. She was coming far slower than her mouth was mioving, and he drew he on, onto the stairs, and down. 'And the women you dated. Good loklkign boy you are, if you can se through all the sztupidity and failure, and those ugly bints'' Tony thought he would fall. On each and every step, his innards jolted, but he made each and was son shielding himself from the lguith of the third. His mother;'s words grew stronger as she passed through it, deeper, as thought the wordxs came from dfeep down below her digrphram, below her guts, from deeper than ecvery sinmgel storey of the Hills, from a place under the Hills. Tony's skin cralweed on th side that faced the third floor double doors. It felt like he was getting the kind of tan doctors warned you against, at tanning salons. He was in the dark again. His world swam and thpose luminous fish shapes were diwn hyer mocving across his eyeballs, in the coean with him. Wheedling little brat. Aslways so weak. I had to kick you out of the hosue to go and play with people, and I woulnd;'t sya friends'' Bring it on, mother, just keep coming. His teeth were clacxkign together already, making the sound of a finger on the pedal of alighre. Click, click, boom. The right floor, the first, his left arm went out and he trcekd the wall. When she came through the doors she made a wet slapping sound, not her mouth but her body,a s though the iomapct of them on her face had taqke away tissuie if not integral, then aethetcially important, such as layers from her cheek. Ad she spokme, then, the sound was slapping, the kin d of noise an anxious person makes, when they spoke, 'God, I wish I'd never met your father, Nothing good evr came of him.'

After al, if she could move, shouldn't they, also? His bowels certainly could. Shit, he thought. The lighter, hwoever, was there, even if they weren't. He click, click lit it and, infront of him and around in a smei circle (rhe wall t his back) were the rthree, the father, the mother, the daughter. A happy little family, all leeri ng in and interent on killing one their sons, and all of humanity. Tony, however, couldn't help laughing.

It was the thick, mothy odour of sweat, perhaps on the sur4faces of the doctor's rpom, by wherfe the needle lay, used like a gun, smokingof droplets of urine co,oured liquid. (That was trhen radium,my mind offered, but I was unable to listen top it, no .l not as yet.) It had, above the thuckness of its odour, a sweet edge. I frowned. Perhaps, it wasn't sweat at all, perhaps it was piss. Perhjaps he had wet himself, after the needle had gone in.

Because they' 'Are you going to A and E?' A male nurse says, pointing to the doors below a sign that repeated the last letters. 'Like, obviously,' Tony says. 'Does this woman look well to you?' The nurse replies but Tony is distracted by a page-fast flicker of white. He doesn't have enough time to wonder if it's the first snowfall of the end of the world, or even to realise it's a doctor's coat before something hits him, hits him hard on the wrist. He's racheted to the side by the impact, both he had his wife, turned around to stare down at the doctor as he splashes to the flagstones. There's enough blood to make the sound liquid. 'It's the doctor,' somebody screams, needleslly. The labcoat is hunched where the doctor's stomach would have been had it not exploded across the pavement. On the doctor's wrist, glinting mischeviously, is a Rolex. It hasn't taken the impact and is still ticking, saved by the wrist it's wrapped around, the veins of which have burst and are lacing blood over the cold flagstones, as if knitting them together. 'My; hasn't time flown by,' Tony whispers at the watch. The screamer is still screaming. It's the male nurse, Tony realises. Tony feels a stickiness to his fingers, as though he's been dipping them in a pot marked 'Honny'. It caught him. The Rolex. It ripped Tony's skin. The thought, Rolex Nicks Man, spreads thorugh Tony's mind like squid ink, until the words are all he can see, and the rest of his consciousness is black, and tabloidy, [tabloid headline, full page, Rolex Nicks Man] Flick. Tony is on the floor alongside the doctor. The doctor has what would have been a pleasant, pudgy, middle-aged face, if it wasn't for the intervening stonework. His teeth are an extra smile, jutting out through his puffed, blooidied cheeks, and he wears his left cheek-bone in the eyesocket of that side. He has an appearance of mellow glee, of easy-going joviality, the expression, though, strained by the impact of the pavement, and by the fact that the doctor has just clearly committed suicide. Tony attempts to smile in return, but he's always awkward when first he meets somebody, and passes out instead. He forgets to wonder where his wife fell. I hate Tony Stones. I hate his accent, which manifests itself not only in his speech, but in the effeminate turn of his fingers and wrissts on questions when he's annoyed, in the way his gors up, ever so slightly onto hos toes when he senses people (m most,, I wuld say) wh0 would gadly punch him. Even, in his writing, wh9ich I have come to hate most of all, not only it, ut the concept of the grande escrituer. The completion of being. Or, being, I think, a little excretment, if you pardon my English. Tony was stood at the nurses' station, his head pressed forward as he did wehen his cheeks rededened, and his smile began to fix, like melted rubber, to his lips. I hate him when he does this. I used to think him handsome. He still is, but he fills my gut with the sugar clotted, bitter after-ache of too much cola. Like own brand coke, the first tastes of him were sweet, his blue eyes, the long face, dark hair, lips a little too full of themselves. It had all been enough for us to move in, together. But it had turned sour too soon, hence the lack of ring on my finger which he has long since calle,d along with the rest fo me, fat. He leans forward, along with his face, bringing all of his charm, to bear.It doesn't sem to tbe working an fhti sbrings me a measuere of satisfaction, along with sadness,.

He isn't. all I get is that head-cocked wide eyed, what-did-I-do-to-deserve-your-hatred. It's not like I ever hit you, is it? There are worse men, aren't rhere?

Through the windsreeen the sunset is a viscous, rabid-eye red. Summer sky. The air has not yet reached the twilight bruised-purple with which Joanne Stones had familiarity; particularly her skin. Torn scraps of cloud, savaged light. It isn't just going down, thinks Tony, it needs to be put down. Like our marriage. There is a sense of drift and white noise on the radio. Their stillness stinks of sweaty struggle, and gunge that has been left to run with the tears. The doors make a ricket-ricket noise - crickets on repeat - and the engine ticks over with a thick, watery sound like that of nicotine addict that just will not quit ' will not light out and die. The silence is theirs alone. I'm' Tony does not let his thought finish, much less say the words out loud. His breathing creeps in and out of his throat as though an adulterer into the martial sheets. If it could, his breath would elope. Joanne looks out at the sunset. It is beautiful. Despite the dictations of society, fashion magazines, and his day-to-day treatment of her, so is Joanne. Tony guesses her eyes have a layer of moisture, dew on lightening grass in the dawn. He doesn't look to see but stares through the windscreen, which needs a clean. Let the sun go down on me, he thinks. He smiles on one side, and that twisted. That was it. The smile feels like a final straw, a husk thick and broken. In times like these, he's more melodranmaric, he thinks, than Elton John. It simply wouldn't do. The smile snaps back into his mouth. He's allowing himself back in. This was way it was. First he, then her. The silence, the thinking it's all finally over, the creeping return to sound, the whispered 'I'm so sorry, so sorry, sorry', and repeat, then the hugs, the kisses, her relaxing back into him, her turning, and around we go again. He isn't going to get his wish. The sun is not for setting. He unhitches the lever on the car door and it swings open with a rusted screech that sets his teeth, like most of him, over their edge, and reminds Tony of just how poorly his writing sells. Double whammy. It would be two of many whammies, out there, beyond the solid white line of the dual carriageway. Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep, says a car, as it passes, in road-runner mockery. I've gone over the cliff, I just don't know it yet. His thoughts are like feet peddling on thin air. He sits, then twitches toward the exit. She doesn't turn. He reaches out and shuts the door. He would have walked around the boot, not the bonnet. He wouldn't have been able to bear her eyes on him. She wouldn't have said anything to stop him, not after he has gone this far. If there were highways in their marriage, he had crossed the solid white lines, then the broken in the middle, and wandered off into the moors beyond. He was lost, in himself the writer, far beyond any of his pointless metaphors, rambling again. He commands his self-loathing and gives himself a quick pep talk, Do it. It is enough. He re-opens the door and makes the step, and the sun goes out, and the step freezes right where it is, as though a step on stairs that leads down into the basement, his hand grasping in dead-cricket shock, for a light-pull it can't find. Later, he will ask himself; did I freeze before the sun went away, or after? The answer, he would discover, was that it didn't matter; they would all freeze, anyway; everyone. Three minutes before the sun went out, he opens the car door to get out. It wasn't the first time. He didn't have the guts to go through with it, I thought. Go, I think, glancing at him when he was half-tunred. I stop doing so, preferring the sunset. It is beautiful. He closes the door, sits for some time, re-opens the door and makes the step. His foot doesn't reach the tarmac. -67 [degrees Celsius] Fifty three days after the sun goes out, an astronaut walks through the snow. It is freshly fallen but hard enough, already, to crunch like bone. The sound only seems to draw the astronaut on. His visor is vacant but swollen with intent, a balled fist of rotting hatred where there should have been a face. The lights of the hospital foyer fell on it and I find myself hoping the second back up generator will go again, despite the dark and cold. Even at this distance, I could see that the only visage which would appear within, would be the reflection of me. Possibly dying. I consider running. Despite the harsh, indefatible intent of its gait, the astronaut doesn't. A modern golem, it just keeps coming, through the freeze, the shearing wind, through the long, thick squalls of snow that looked as though God was tring to rub us out. Ball the paper, start again. Not far to go, I thought, of the act and the astronaut. I shiver and the action, though tiny, breaks the snow-globe spell. I run, wondering why I didn't earlier.

The drive hasn;'t been easy, even only from Yorkshire. The eyes have seen the worst of it. A child, blonde, me twenty years previously, stood beside a burning car, screaming 'daddy'. I stopped, though my corsa was full. Couldn't help stopping, but she was gone. For the life f me I have been attemping not to guess where, or how. I like to think she didn't go in after him. My haed aches as though it has been attempin g to digest the events of the evening. The result of which isn't indigection but the kin d of mihraine that would be glasd to hear that he sun has gone, even if forever. I am at the nurses station. 'I'm going now.' He could come or not. I tended to hope for the second, though I found it hard to care, anymore, but knew he would make the calculation; public transport on a nmight like this, and come with me, in the neighbouring seat. Learning to drive was supposed to give me indepence. Instead, it has given my life a passenger. 'Look, I know you must be busy, an evening like this,' eh was talking to the nurse again. I considered simply walking awayu. It was hard these days, We owned property together, and like that man in the poe story, it had bricked thme both in together, seemingly forever. Fucking housing markjeyt. 'Please, I need to see my Mum.' 'It's not visiting time.' With the bad timing if an apocapyse, of this evening, two men exited the doors to the ward. Tony's head thrust forward again. Peck-peck-peck, UI thinl' Soonm here'll be nothing keft of you, either, I think, thinking of the nurse. I feel hollowm, except, of course, for the pain. There's despir as well, but that has an surpirsin emtiness of its own, that ofa hole in a darkened sky. 'I'[m goiung to go,' I said. It was difficult to hear, even for myself,. There was a whining. I realpies it is my ex. 'Please,' he doesn't refer to the men. They frighten him, I can tell. He's a black belt, and all; I can fight, and I've had street fights, but faced with men shaved bald and swollen foreheads, and scarred by childhoods that keep their eyes jangling in their sockets, he backs down. He's a coward,a nd not just deep down inside. Not the only way in which he has the featires of a chicken, I think. He wants to say; how cvome thwy can back there, they're clearly no t staff, and I can#'t. I recognise them, though TYony properl;y doesn'. He never sees the little people, especially the northerners, and most especially the mans. He's a pucblished authpr, you know, and though he moks this, polishing up his already posh accent as eh does so, theres more than a seed of truth in his faux-arrogance. More lkike a fully grown oak. 'Fine,' I said, louder than I intended. One of the men turn to look at me, his dark eyes like burning pitch roiling across my skin. I blush. I turn from him. I can't help but agree with Tony's fear. They are gone, into the lift. I head toward the stairs. Lifts scare me, and never more so than when there are men like those two, in them. I am unsure why, as I am of why I sometimes can't get out of bed, or find myself crying, in the bath. My therapist has been little help, as ever. I go. 'Fine. And thanks for all your help,' Tony said,. He would be reddening, as ever he does when he drops the mask of charm. And it is a pretence, I should know. He goes down the stairs two behind me, talking. But then, he's always talking, and, like a bloody writerm he thinks people are interestedm, I SUPOPOSE. His books sales, and the way I don't reply, would suggest otherwise. The house despite being a semi in an insiopid suburb had character. Character in spades, thought Tony Stone, thinking, as he so often did, that he was turning a new phrase' It's buried us alive. The mortar had sealed them in, like two hearts in a Poe story rather than one. There was too much equity to lose, no matter that Tony had already lost the kind of things people said you couldn't put a price on. Her love. Ingrity. The knowledge that had never cheated on a woman. There gad been that, at elast, and that, now, on top of everything else he had called his own, was gone. Tony walked up the stairts. His mood did not rise with his body, and his knees and thighs struggled aganst the meagre, repetive domestic climb as though they felt there was no point, any more, even in these little things. Maybe it was the sun going out that had dampenede his spirits, he considered. Maybe it was the house itstself. There lack of love for each other ad, as if to an unwanted child, transferred itself to the bricks and nmortar. Chipped paint in grey, zombie fingerprints. Used to be, there was life hear, the prints said. Scarred paintwork as though nails had been run along ythre walls. Dust had built up in the niches of the steps he tranversed, like the hair of an old, balding man, furring around the edges, worn down in the centre of the steps. There were bits on the floor which neither of them could be bothered to hoover. They picked at his eyes, and at what remained of his self worth. Tony thought of a corpse, vultures.

He ould hear the sound of his wifes fingers ona keyboard. She had shut the door to the study. The door, the white wood, the way it was rammed against eh am, seemed final. The crackle of the keyboard was relentless. Tony had an image of onny in the Shining, tyoing over and over 'All work and no play all work and no play..' but with 'hate' and his name. It's over, he knew. Today had put a nail in it. The way she had treated him, especially in the car, especially in front of strangers, the way she looiked down at him' Tony's mind was no stranger to this line of thought, nopr to this place on the landing, where he stood and listened to the sound of what their relationbship was now. Her facebooking her friends, not in secret, but in privacy, her words nebulous as the internet itself; 'I really don't know how long we can go on like this' I hate to say it but he really is such an arsehole' God, I'm just sick of this, I know it sound petty, but'' She had barred Tony. He looked upward. The bulb, bare at this angle in its basque of plastic made to resemble metal, hurt his eyes. He squinted and imagined he was looking at a small sun. His imagnationn was convincing enough and he saw only a bulb through eyelashes. A moth battered against, fingernail-flicks of its wings. Tony wondered what the moths would do, during the day, without the sun. It couldn't get into the bulb, try as it might. Grimacing, Tony looked down. The stairs were dirty, moth balled in dust. He walked down them and into the kitchen and, reaching into his pocket, retirved his mobile phone. He felt ashudder going through the artery of that wrist, as though his blood were repelled by the Nokia. Inside, he sloshed, his gutsm his heart. H looked up, again, but not this time at the bulnb, but to allow the tears to sink back in. They did. Not a droped was spilt on his cheeks. He clenched these, and his teeth, and found his father's number on the mobile. It was time, now that his widfe could not hear Tony. He would tell him that his marriage was over. He had been putting this off. He pressed dial but the phone beeped, reading 'network busty' on the displayt. It must be the sun going out, he thought. Everybody phoning their loved ones. He sighed with relief. He hadn't really wanted to do this. Somehow, it was harder than the slow, fractured goodbye. He couln't recall the last time he had talked to his family on the phone. In this house, he had been reduced firs to a whiper, then a whuimper, now silence. If this place had characterm it was that of an abusive matriach, waiting on the edge of thesette withn her lips curling and ust waiting, just waiting for an excuse to throw something. Go on, love, just give me a reason. His lother inlaw, in other words. Tony unlocked the back door and walked into the yard. Butressed by housing, it was little;e more than a spit of concrete, but it wasn't overlooked. Like an oubliette, it had become Rony's private place. Itw as quiet out here. Shouldn't the end of the world be noisier? Yhe questionw as aFRankenstenien twitch, but the life soon went out of it. Tony stared at the stars. He was quite unable to name them. The night balmed the skin of his cheeks and forehead with hits summnery warmth. The skin there replied with a flush of slight sunburn. He had laid back in his sister-on-laws garden, that afternoon, taking in the rays, ignoring family members that were soon to become ex, the looks that said they knew, baskin in the momemtn, because everyone after this was overcast. Glad I did that now, he thought, and smiled at the stars. He fixed ion staying there, gradually cooling like a staue on a tuscan hill fter sundown, and wait for the sun to reappear. He spun on his heel. The heavens spun with him, as though he were the prick of a pinpoint, and the sky its head, and on that all the angels balanced. I feel like a prick, he added, thinking of his siste in law and her downstairs toilet. His calves began to ache and he gave up and went back in, lying on the couch, and switche through TV channels. News. News. News. From Ireland, a nship in the Stlantic. East coast. All reporters standing as though at gigs where the sar attraction didn't show, not once. The sun spent the night not rising and Tont fell asleep in dribbles, waking to Los Angeles, darkness, Cash in the Attic, then to Tkyo, everythim darkness. Exhausted pitch, bunched and ancient as Miss Havisham's veklvet drapes. It was late morning when Tony awoke. It was still night. Rnnnrrnngg rrrrnnngggnnngg He would say he was influenced by Stephen King, at boom readionsg where nobody went. First bare light, like a slap across the corneas. Then darkness, like the televoision broadcasts from New York, from Moswcow. Then pain, in a rachet at the place where his spine was levered to the side, his head on th arm of the settee. The sound eturned. Nggggnnnngggg. Nnnnnnngggnnn'nngggnnng. This is Misery, he thought, before the shout of, 'Are you going to get that or what?' It hadn't", "label": 1}

Thick and grited as the leepy to the left and right of each eye. He remembered where he was. That they till lived together. Misery, he recllaed. Bfore he remembered what had happened to the sun. Rnnnnggggg. The phone stopped its ringing. He was up, not on his feet, but on his bottom, sitting strauight, before his head had properly registered that itw as awak. Stars made constellations before his eyes and he closed them and the stars went green and big as fish mouths, gping, and vlowing bubbles across the darkness behind his loids. He stretched,a nd, lookin g once moere, turned to the curtains that were always shut. That meant something, he thought, as he twitched them open, I'm a LAYABAOUT, A good-for-nothing, unemployed, and benefit scrounger. Another world, all of it. It was. The street light where on and the range that fell fom them seemdd spread thin, as if too little marmalade over too much toast. One winked as though it wished to go out, knowing, perhaps, that it had overstayed its allotted welcome. Tony had felt like thatm especially after fucking his sister-in-law. How couldn't they smell it>? He had thought. 'God, this room stinks,' his wife said. Tony tuened in a jolt. Behind her was the TV set,w ith an image of the international space station. It floated in the void, outlined only in lights, like the Christmas tree of a dovorcee, small, same colour lights. His blood finished opltin in his veins, sl;oshing back to fill his heart. He felt abruptly like crying and hid it by yawning, placing his hands to his face. 'When you finally get up, you might want to think about gettimg some food in,' said Jo. Her brown eye sratcheted to the right. Against the pale skin of her temples, flanked by curls of blonde, they looked like they didn't belong, didn't want to be here. YTony guessed they both knew how that felt. 'Food is going get in shirt supply. There's been tweets about Tesco running out of tins, beans, and shoit alreaduy. I'm going to my Mum's, so it's up to you. But if you're staying here, you might want to have something to eat.' Her eyes rebounded to hinm. He could have sworn the pupils narrowed and wondered iuf that was tge physiologically signage of hate. 'No skin of my nose, one way or another.' Tony had thought, a few months into their relationship ' ever since no lomnger thinking it cute ' that her nose was overlong and could do with losing some skin. 'Who was on the phone?' 'I don't know. I didn't answer it,' he tried to say. The soreness in his throat mothballed the words, and he tried again. 'Don't know,' he said. She shrugged. DShe was halfway to the door, halfway through it. 'I'm be leaving for Yorshire later to' later.' Her vouce softened. There was a softness, there, always,w asn't there, a rotten centre to heir divorce that had kept them sumped together. Tony hated the hope he felt when he heard it. 'Look, I can take you as far as the metro, if you'd like. You'll be wanting to see your mum, won't you,. At the hospital.' 'Yeah, thanks. That would be nice of you.' The brown eyes didn't seem to like the thought of being noe, and hardened, as sod tramped down over a corpse. 'Yeah,' she added, and left. Her feet were heavy on the stairs. Tony put his hands to the sides of his face. His unshaved cheeks were a mismatch of hairs, long and short. He plucked at them for awhile, seeking a perfection that existed nowhere else in his life. His fingers began to crimp, his neck bubbling with a rahs, and he rose. There was alwaysa another hair. He padded to the phone. Somehow, over the years, his footsteps had taken the opposite position to that of his wife's quietening as er became thickset, whispering the more they shouted at each other. Their house was an eggshell, walked from the inside, but no matter how careful he was, there was always another argument, anther crack. His feet felt frayed, his tether broke all the more often, these days. Tony picked up the phone. The handset hummed into his ear, a continousous note. He dialled 1471. The hum continued. Tony stared at the grey plastic. He was red, stained with Bolognese, he guseed, most things in the hosue where stained by something. It looked like old blood, as though, at some point, the phone had been wounded, cut by one word or other. He jiggered the button, of on, off. The hum continued, like a sself-important fridge,. The cars on the M60, the rising sound of insanity at the base of his skull. He slammed the receiver closed on the set, and licked his lips, delicatelely. He realised he did this, whenever he threew an iten back at her, as if they neded a little deloicay in this place, and his ongue would hav e to do what his hands would not., anymore. He pulled at his phone from the pocket of his jeans. He had slept in them and the phone had wedged in behind his cards. He kept everything in the left pocket, the bottom of the right hd long since dropped out. He should buty a new pair, but he wouyld need money for solicitors when she got round to seeing them. He laughed, short and wooden, the bark of a dog swiftly kicked. Upstairts she slammed the door to study shut. Solicitors, he thought. In the apocalypase.

He put on his trainers, spilt on the right as his jwans were and, avoiding the mirror at the end of the hall as he left, opened the front door. The night sky abed at him, as though the lottery hand (shouting 'It shuld be blue!') and staggered in the porch. Thatw as a surprise,e he thought, the shock, as though his body, upon seeing that the sun had gone, could not give uo as easily as his mind,. With a new years tush of beeps, his phone filled with text messages. He looked. ASre you okay? Where are you? Can you come down? How's Jo? All rom his father. Nobody else. There's had been the kind of marriage that burnt bridges ot the oputdide. Dad, Tony noticed, had asked about her last. She had never liked him, nor his mother, and it was the latter that had always worrird him. Bad siogn, Tony thought, looking at the dark smudge fo where the sun should be, floating across the sky like liqurice melting on a frying pan. 'hello?' said a voice to his lefyt, thriought he bushes. @hello?' Itw as cracked with age, quereous, and shot through with busybodyness. 'Hello?' Tony said, tryimg to pretend he didn't know who it was. Tnhe pretence couldn't last. 'Oh, it's ponly me. I eard something and wanted to check everything was okay?' Vivian. Next dodor neighbour. Face melted by age, not yet wrinkled, but ridged backl from her mouth. Eyes grey and washed out as her hair. 'Starnge things going on, these days.' She said. 'Hello Vivian, how are you?' 'Fine, fine, can't complain. I used to libve ina bungalow, you know, really lovely house, but my daughter in law thought I should live here. Nearer to them, and all. Right hard getting up the stairs in the cold nights.' Tony stared at her. It's always blody night, heis mind seethed. 'What's your anme, again? I'm always forgetting.' 'Tony,' said Tony. 'I'm ust popping ouit tot eh shops.#' his feet made as if to move. 'Can't believe the weather recently,' said Vivian. Itw as never going to be that easy. 'No, Tony found himself sayinf, 'Crazy isn't it.' 'Mad.' Agreed Vivian. 'Do you think we'll see a bit of sun any time soon?' Tony felt a scream coming up his windpipe and quickly said, 'Not with Manchexzter weather, eh? Rain, rain rain.' 'S'pose so,'s aid Vivian. She turned away. ;Can't stay and chat, though, must get on.' 'Bye.' Said Tony. Viviam didn't reply and Tony rubbed his face with his palms, scoruing his hair with his fin gers. The face felt platicy and unfamiliar. The hair was ust as thick and messy as ever. The scream, at elastm, erecede into his belly, and, in its steadm, goose bumps ranged around his skin like free range poulty. He was wearing the same blue hoodie as yesterday and zipped it, now, as he walked up Linbver Close and turnmed right toward the shops. There was a grouop, nbbehidn bhim and to the left, but he didn't look. Tony wasn't a big man and he had loomng since found that loking made people look back. 'Oi, hoodie,' one shouted. Laughter. Tony's back crawled with it, as though withn leeches. It thinned him, his heart curling up inside his chesta dn looking for a rib behin d which to hide. 'Hoodie, hoodie, blue hoodie,' another sang. Laughter. He imagined baggy, gaping mouths like shirt sleeves several sizes too big for the extra small frame of humour on which it hung. Tony's footsteps spurted forward along with his adrenalin. 'Hoodie,' giggle, 'coward.' Police sirens battered the air blue. They were at the end of the road he stood om, as were the shops. The smashing of glass cracked down the intervening space. Why weren't the police stopping, the thought, He didn't like to think what was happening further down that road. A man in a grey hoodie and grey ogging pants sprints down the middle of the street, carrying a bottle of White Lightning, and a box of Frosties. Tony couldn't help but think, Milk! Tony turnrd left, into a sideroad, away from the corner shop and toward another. YTony was a writer, and was more used to withdrawing than meeting the world head on. Tony wouldn't have called himself a coward, but others did, and his wife most often, among them. Eventaullay, in a loop of pavement, he passed the shops,a nd the crowd outside it. Tony walked around the roads, passed shops but like the moth at yesterday' bulb, he never entered. There was something Darwinian about looting, he would think walking past each one, survival of the fittest. It was never little old ladies, or men, like him, with glasses, height issues, or hair. The apocaplyse was like winning a world cu;p he decide, pithily, everybody out on the streets, brought together, except all those who weren't. He didn't dare look at them, but through the cornesr of his eyes. His vision fuzzed and darkened as thgough withdrawing into the housing of his brain, turning off the lightsas it went. The writer in Tonyw as used to up and leaving his body, going out of body, and it did so, now, leaving the lights off in himseld, drifting toward the garishly liughted dacade of the 7-10. He tripped on a wonky tooth of fkagstone, but kept going. His head ecohoe,d empty. He walked across the road, not looking left or right or at the looters. He didn't see the black cat that crossed at his feet and failed to touch wood (his forehead) as he would normally. He didn't quite feel himself.

Tony thought of shovels and meat and soft loam and crunching bones, but it the sound was a similie all of its own, and thw writer in Tony shrank as he the nboise enbded and the cat began to screech. There was the soft bubbling of guts going the wrong way, and the screa,m became a choke. Inside, in aline down his boy, Tony's windpipe constricted, and his stomach,a nd hois buttocks, as he attempted to will himself out of existenc. The land rover hadn't stoped. The looters had an were turning. Tony hadc made the furthest pavemenht. He didn;'t turn to look. His imaginationwas more than enough. He staggered around a post box and back into the street than ran to his own. Men in tacksuits with no hair and boxes of stella ran down toward the blur in Tony's perceptyion that was the cat. Its blackness desceneded and seemd to eat at the world around it. He heard, 'That car ust kept gon g,' 'The bgastards,' 'It's not going to make it,' 'Look at him, ust ognoring that porr cat,' 'Look at him, running away,' 'hooide, blue hoodie, hoodie.' Breaking, as did his mind, into a scattred run, he hared along the pavement, his eyes bulging before the rest of his body, willing ti on, his mouth saying, 'sorry, sorry, sorry.' Behind him, distanced by the breath crawling ou of his windpipe, behind the scuff of his shoes, he herad the sound of a box of lager falliung on a cat's head, and, 'It's dead.' 'It's dead!' 'Coward,' said Tony. He didn't know who he was shouting at, but he kept running into the words. 'Coward, coward.' The duvet wwas banked up aroundme as loam around the places where small animals go, to hiberdate or to die. The heaped contact is not just the covers, but in the stench of me, which has accumalted over the weeks since I have changed these. It is dark in here. The curtains are drawn. A black hole of my own making. I would feel embarrassed, if I wasn't so ashamed. The lights in the room are off and the air of it is heavy with despair as a summer meadow wuith pollen. To it, I am dsmay-feveered, weeping, unable to breathe, wishing my lungs would just shut down. I lie fuully clothed and if I will be able to ris,e this time, the third of what is supposed to be the morning. I find it hard to raise enthusiasm for the night. Despite being fully clothed and having somewhere I desperately want to go. Away from here, from him. Home.My herat is a crushed can of red bull inside, crumpled where once it had been pressurised with ' and ' and garish, flourescent hope - all the chemicals of the high. Inside, my wings are broken in several places and clipped halway along their span. Tony had been out too long. 'Tony' is the first word on the new page of my journal. Though daek, I can still see it, on the orther pillow. My pen bars its closing and the word is large and kjagged and deep, an inky slit uike the depths of an abyss below the sea, but not so long or lrga eas the word it accompanies 'arsehole'. The white paper is a pallid, shaven upper lip emabrrsed by the words scrawled over it, seeming to withdraw, as lips and nostrils from something rotten. 'Tony is an arsehole. At first, He looks likt eht best kind of person. He relies of his quick grin (antisocial charmer's smile) and blue eyes to hide the fact that he is the worst.' 'Arsehole.' The last was written as much vertically as horizontally, graffiti more than journaling. My knuckles still ache from scribving oit. The muscle sof my uipper back and shoulders scramble amongst each other, the loose scree of a rockslide. S remember what my therapist has told me, and Chinese burn onbe hand around anither, massage the impression of freidnly hands into my wrist. As if somebody out there cares. As if. A snap shot iof my mother, as much grapseshot as anything, pepsr my brain, holing my consciousness. It feels every time I crawl in her andcan't get out,. That my world is ending. I don't think I have the enrgy to get up and start again,. Somehow, though, I always do. This itm,e however, the world was really over. This made it easier to get up. Tony had been gone too long. I wasn't goin g to wait for him, anymore. \\I ;ve been waitin for him for years. For him to stop swearingat me, saying that I'm 'pissing and moaning' evry time I cry. To leave, like any decent man would. I have to get out. I roll right, then left, a tiger ina tiny cotton cage. My journal snaps closed, the pen rolling out then lost in the ruffs of duvet. I turn asgain, my back and ache that goes up and around my scalp to my eyes. I rise in a Meths 'man judder of limbs, needle sharp and cold, rattling around the bedroom, piling my clothes into a gym bag. I've never used the gym before but have the bag, several times.

Further down Bury New Road, the lights of police vans banaged the night in swathes of blue. This is her fault, thought Tpny, but couldn't think of one good reason why. His mind sought to pin blame on her, as a blinded kraken playing pin the tentacle on the ship. He missed. He swung. 'We should have gone along Bury Old Road,' he said. It was the most pointed he could be, without her breaking him off. She ignored him. The dark between TFO and the Esso, down under the metro bridge, was inky with black, and wet with rain. The world, in the spaces between the orange street lamps, had th consistency of chewed liquorice. 'We'll never get there,' said Tony. Joanne turned up Capital FM, on the radio. Theyw ere playing Texas, after Elton John 'Don';t Let the Dun Go Down on Me'. Tony guessed Mr brightside, next. The song faded to an audio black shot through with sirens outside the corsa, and the DJ said, 'That's complaint number seven.' His voice slurred across the speakers, as the sirens went the opposite direction. Ckoth edged where they were sharp, and cutting. 'Well, I'm so fucking sorry, but it's the end of the world. What do you fucking want radio four. Your more than bloody welcome to them. According to radio bloody four there'es been multiple outbreaks of looting and rioting, la-di-dah and the peasants are revolting because they want some cake to eat. The apocalypse brings out the scum in people, darlings didn't you know. And that's the fucking news. The' sun.. has.., gone' out. Should have been the daughter, shouln't it, cause women always leave, right?' slurp, gulp., Tony couldn't help but agree. He grinned, wide enogyu, he hioped for Joanne to notice. 'Here's the traffic, don't go out, it's simplky death ouyt there darlings. So, I don't know about you, but I'm locked up in here, security's not going to answer at receiptin cause theyr'e dick deep in the recitonist. Lovely hgirl, Zara. And here's what I'm going to do,' there was a pause in which gulping could be heard, and the crinkle of an aluminium can that sounded too dented and empty to carry on. 'I'm going to play the excellent Soundgarden with, yes, that's right, it could only be Blacvk Hole Sun.' No Brightside, thought Tony. 'What's going on?' asked Tony. She didn't reply. 'Have you seen that crowd outside Tesco's?' Again, no response. He resolved to remain quiet. There was a enough of a sense of a hole about the night withbout digging another one fo his own. Past the traffic lights, across the mni-roundabput, the front of the sup[erm,arlet was visible, or it's roof was, its windows obscured by humanituy cast into a silhoutee of mass by the lights within and the dark without. Here and there between the growth thatw as ten cxrowd, luminous police vests could eb seen bobbing, but too few, like buoys before a tsunami. Glass shattered and mouths screams. It didn't from this didtsnace, cut together with sirens, and presented on the tableu of pitch black fear, sound like terror, but more feral. A collective feeding frenzy. No better place for it than Tesco's, thought Tony, while an image of ranked vampires from I Am Legend eneterd his a nother part, and woulnd't move on. 'I'm not going there,' he said, his resolve shredded. 'I'm going to turn around when I can,' she said. 'And on the motorway.' He didn't need to look at her eeys to see that they would be wide, wild, distant. Se would be as much goine, in her thoguths, as she was, in their relationship. 'It's probably just as busy tehere,' he meant to say, but only got as far as 'It's probably'' When a flame drahon fired itnot he night. Therew as an explosive blasta dn a primordial leap to his heart, fasta s a gheko. Anoryer erution followed he first, each kept close as Smaiug's ire in his ,koutnain, by the roof of the petrol station. One after another, Tesco's petrol station became the kind of bonfire eyes could not believe they were seeing. Brains, up and down Bury New Road, struggled to cram everything in and the line fo traffic juddered into a jam. Further along, the police vans had given up on all but their sirens and shapes, black on black, limned by white seroial numbers, ran toward the supermarket. To their right, a man carrying a petrol can rn the opposite way, toward the roundaboput their corsa had just circled. His jacket was on fire, and he seemd not to know it, running as fast as he could from the flames but taking them with them. Tony tuend, unable to twust and watch. There was a further shock, and the sound of a can ratrtling across the tarmac. 'I've got to get out of here,' aaid Jpoanne. 'Why did I agree to bring you. Nothig good ever happens when I try to help other people.' Furthert off, a steeple clanging in Prestwich, obfused by the clamour of the road ahead, interferebce leaking through, as thougn God were communicating but all the metal above their heads were nbblcoking out the signal. It lolled lopsidedly and ata frntic pace, as would a bell lobbed down a hill. Decidly, thought Tony, thingds were not going uphill. Sweat dampemned Tony's jeans,a nd beneath them, the edge of the seat was an imposition into his thighs. His legs ached, as though they longed to run. Joanne turned to him.

'And I supoose you'll blame me for the sun going ou next, won't you, you bitch,'Tony said, befor wehe ad begun to think let alone realised what he was about to say. She turned away. 'Get out, ;s ehs said. Tony gulpd, but his ehadc went in the reverse direction tot eh saliva, his chin jutting forward, his fears pushed foerqwrd, exposed and vulnerable on his features. 'I'm sorry.;' The words felt well worn, his tingue ploughed by their progress until it was furrowed. There wasn't a seed of respite on her face. If their relationship was a crop, it had long ago been blighted. 'Get out,' she said. Tony's hands strayed left to the handle, hbis eyes to the right, to her. Everything in between coiled, twisted until it began to fray. His eyes bulged, filling with liquid, stretching from the brain that could not cope with what they saw, the retinal tendons at full strain, as though ropes ona rack. He was scared, he had to admit. He didn't want to stay, he wanted to walk away, but he was afraid of what he would run into, out there, tonight. 'You can't make me,' he said. You going to through stuff at me again,. To get me out, are you? You know those tests you had, that said you gad a bloody male brain?' There was an edge to his voice, like the window washers, even he could hear- it 'plasticy, divorced from as she soon would be, dripping with bile. He, all of him, to his bottom on his seat, to the way his flesh sat on his boens, felt on edge. 'Maybe I'm the wife, eh, and you're thre beater?' 'Get' out.' There was a finality to her tone, Being a writer, he read into it other words. They weren't 'of this car,' but were 'of this fucking relationship, you bastard.' He tipped over, from fear to anger, and unhitched the door, and tried to rise. Jerked back, he unclichked his seat belt, and, his skin feeling the colour of the stop lights scattered in front like autumn elaves against a dreay window pane, and spat on my the sky, he stepped into the road. A horn blared to his, left despite the lines of traffic not moving any where. The car's owner gunned the engine,a dn the tyres of the car to his side leered forward ont eh s;icked tarmac. He didn't look. Won't give them the pleasure, he thought. Too scared they might get out, he knew. He wiped rain water from his eyes. It was rain water. It smelt acrid, his hand as it ssed by his wife, and he rememberd an old comic strip ('Is rain when God sweats too much') He should be sweating, now. He addedm, top himself, the big show at the end of the world is coming. He walked inbetween the cars, exposed on their headflights as any butterfly on a leipodstursts torch. His limbs were thickenin, filled with the starch of adrenaline. It felt as though his muscles gave a crinkling sound, as they moved, though it was hard to hear anything above the tumult of hors, engines, fire, screams, the blast of a gun. As if shot, Tony's attention came back from the gun shot further across the road, as though he had been blown across it. His heart spasmed blood into his forearms, of all he places, he could feel it, hot, angling. He looked about. Left, right, behind. Two figures were walking between the cars. One wave a stubby shadow. For senthign so short itw as gravid with threat. Tony bent and scurried forward then, like atrapped beetle, back, loping low toward the corsa. His back crawled with the impression that a bullet might enter it, and he wished it were more like a beetle's. The men were closing. He reached the side window, bnged, one palm flat on the glass. Stop this, it seemd to sign. His wife took one glance, then looked away. He banged once. This was followed by another gunshot. Perhaps she had not heard the first,. He thought, as she turned, eyes widening and whitening. She leant doble and cracked open the door. He slid in, closded it, locked it. 'Thank you, thank you,' he nsaid. 'Where are they? Was that a gun?' By the first question, he guessed she knew the snaswer to the second. 'Are you alright?' she asked. His lungs opened wide in grautuyde, as if tey tried to hug her, Reapproachment always felt like this. The sex was even better. 'Yes, thanks,' he said. He moved on from the emotion. Her concern would only last so long, he knew, before zshe recalled 2what she thought of him. He distracted. ;'Can we get out. Can't you do a u-turn?' He was still hunched, a bug as much as a man. Yes, tht was what she though tof him. Teg glint was back in her eye, the shield coming up, she looked away. 'Yeah, how am I meant to do that? this sin't the bloody batmobile.' There was a knock against the windo, beside Tony's head. It sounded final,a nd felt like wetting himself. Momentarily, he realiseda spurt had emerged into his boxers. 'Shit,' he said. Thwe gun was gone. The image of it, vague in the dark, smoked still in her mind, burning with its own heat. 'Open the door,' I said. Tony's chin was fodoin g its chicken dance, peck, gulp, forward, gulp. Tony liked to think himself a man who was afraid of no other, a publishe casuthor no less, who weas intelligent enough, wasn't he, to ouwit anybody. Normally, I like to atch as he is symied by the kind fo men standing outsid,e now, but nornmally is not a ight like this which goess on forever filled with fire and gloch and gunshot, and men like this m,en I know because", "label": 1}
{"text": "I grew up with their type. My uncle is away for attemoted murder, after all, and the stickiness of my palm on the wheel, the way in which my tongue adheres to my gums, they remind me of my childhood and, and Uncle Tommy. 'Open the door?' he says , 'you're crazy aren't you, fucking round the loony tunes bend.' He is whispering when, in our house, he would have shouted, still, apart from the th bob-bob of his adam;s apple, when behind closed doors he would leer forward, redden, wheel his arms about his head like a windmill that had gone mad. He reddens, now, as I lean across and open the door. 'Wha'' he manages, before the air intrudes,a dn bis voice would be heard by the men. 'Hi, John, isn't it? Johnny?' The taller one is rogueishly handsome asnd hard to forget. It in't because tony is male that he has done so, nor that he is a publishe author, you, know, and who remembers the little people. Iut is because Johnny is northern, and common to boot, and not someone with whom Tony's mind would wish to associate, or memorise. The shorter man is rogueishly scarred, cut as a mugger might be, and ugly as anybody you wouldn't want to meet in an alley. 'Aye,' said Johny. 'Joanne in't it, love. And'' a glint, there, in Johny's eyes, like that at the barrel of the gun,. When he had slid it into his hip-length, khaki green jacket. 'Tonmy, rigt, mate?' Tony is a statue trying top crumble into the car seat. A hand is extended toward him. I can't help but think , a gun toting hand. Tony wipes his own on the jeans, an action too obvious, it elcits the smile on Johny's lips, the scorn in his eyes, and shakes in return. He holds on, it seems, to me, too long,and grips too tight, as if to deny his cowardice, but Johny's eyes show only steely grey, and not even the scorn. 'You remember my brother, Chrissy?' 'Aye,' I say, the accent of my tingue slipping into fmiloar grooves. 'Aye,' said Tony. It is a bark, too short. He lips don't seem to be able to breathe and speak at the same time, or , at elast, not well. It must shake his confidence in himself, I think. It should. 'Alright love, mate,' said Chrissy. Hi eyes are not visible, shadowerd by his forhead, but something about the twitch of his cheeks, the way they refuse to settle around the words, tells me it is good I cannot see their expression. Tony's words come back to me, acidic, with the pungency of vomit, 'round the loony tunes bend'. He is r4estless on his feet, in the actions of his hands, and had the loomof a man who, if he were kicking or hitting you, wouldn't know how to stop. 'Hey,' I turn down the radio,. I'm trying to keep my voice level, and to disguise my gulps by lowering my chin, wiping my nose. The radio wasn't helping, not now the Dj had begun to sob. 'Why don;'t you hop in. Going to the hospital, right?' 'Yeah,' said Johnny. His smile added to his charm and detracted from the memory of the gun inside his jacket. Beyond the breasts of dusky green she could see a man u, shirtm, not this season's, but the kind Cantona ou;d have worn when giving a man a kick in the chest. 'Going to visit your mum?' Tony turned to me, his lips loosening, falling open, his bleu eyes watery with shock, as though slapped. 'Yeah, got to don't you, you know, time like this?' 'Sure,' said Jonny. His brother was silent. OR he w as swearinf under his breath. I can't quite tell, and dion't want to. 'Got to,r ight. Only thing yopu can do, get to your love ones. We're going to see our Dad, right.' 'Sure,' I say. Neirther Tony nor his lips were getting it togther. Poiintedly, I poked himand said, ' Go on sweetheart, get out and le Johhnny in the front. His legs are too long for the back, we'd have to fold him up like a deckchair.' Johnny laughed. Iw as waiting for that and do the same. Dirty, low, long, just the way my uncle used to like. I don't push Tony, but he exits the car as if I have, or the leis I can tell repel him. Two norths, then I think, and the face of my mother returns to me thoughts, how they would disappear together, her and Tpny,a nd be goen too long. I push away the thought of them. Tony has forgotten himself, his souythern charm, his twinkly public school act. Johnny cranks the lever on the side of the orsa's seat and ushers him. 'Your car mate, thanks for giving up the front, though. Think I'd be eating my kneecaps back there.' 'That's'' Tony ahs lost it, the sentence, along with the rest. He gets in. he is the red he goes when he will shout at me later. I don;'t care. He should remember how much danger we're in. I smile at Johnny, tyhen Chrissy, who, I don';t think anyway, is looking at me. 'Lucky us running into each like this,' I aid. 'What are the odds, but you said you lievd round here, I forgot.' My voice is running on. My tongue, my the sound of it, is all too aware of the gun. I seem to my at a height far above it, and not just the distance of my brain, ,listening from on high at its sounbd. Listen to me prattling,' I said. 'I lughed. Weird evening, senind me' round the loony tunes bend 'a bit nuts,' I finish. I glance at Chrissy, but he doesn't react.

In the back seat he and Tony are pent up breath, like a victim and serial in a horror film, int eh same cellar. Johnny shuts the door. It creaks in protest. I can't hear Tony so much as breathe. We wait. TGime stretches out liem agarotte wire. I gulp and finds even that hard. 'Sorry, love,' said Johnny. 'I don't ant to be a back seat driver, butg why don't you drive up the pavement, until you get to the that road right there. I know a back way,. You're never goin g to get throiugh here, like.' I nod, gun the engine, giulp again under its growl, and ram the car up from the tarmac, up over the pouted lip of the pavemtn, nearly stalling. The corsa shudders, but continues and we shudder past the traffic. Beeops sound until Chrissy rises in the back seat and point and tunr sthe pinting first into a swearing finger,a nd then into a mime across his jugulr. I turn lefta s soon as I can, clodding up the edge of sward of coal colouired grass, and screech away up a side road. 'Right,' said Johnny, and I do so. In the back, I hear Chrissy., I had forgoteen how he sounded likekm a lesbian bar maid from a soap opera, all husk and the dead skins of roill ups. 'Who do you support?' he said, to Tony. 'What?' said Tony. Itw as a squeewk. I can't rmemeber him sounding posher. 'Who' do' you' support?' the words are dragged out over the husk of his larynx, sounding, each as neadly as a node of cancer. There was a code to this, I knew, from my Dad, my Uncles. The male morse of sport, al;legiance, power, even. 'I just support whoever's winning,' said YTony. Itw as his standard line, though delivered with none fo the normal twinkle. 'I'm a whore when it comes to football teanms. Domestimes I even change sides halfway through.' I blanch, though I shouldn't care for him, now, not at all. It is the listening to a car crash, the screech, squeall, loosened wheels running down the hill. I can feel Chrssy's satre. Not knife-like; A beheading. Then, he laughs, huk-huk-huks somehow making it over the barren hills of his tonsils. Huk-huk-huk. Johnny isn't laughing but smiles. Secret, that says, I know where the bodis are kept, and what he will do with your's, mate. Huk-huk. Chriissy manages, before th next. 'The problem with whores, mate,' huk. 'Is they end up being screwed in the end.' Tony laughs, quick as he can. Coltish, like a girl giving her virinity away too early, his laughter running away with itself. Chrissy has stopped before he has realised, and before he can. Chrisssy is still staring at him. Tony, I can see in the rear view mirror, lookms away. 'Cooking with gas,;' said Cherissy, Tony ddidn't look at him. He wss till smiling. Tony could tell, the feel of it burnt on his cheek like freshly stiched, scarlet A. Ton was looking out of the window, at the passing, world, down the streets of which could be seen thwe afterimages of fires and, occasionally, the raw shock of an uncontained blaze. Sirens slappe the ngith air senselss, producing a whine in Tony's ears, made an interofation of his brain. Why can't I look at him~? Why do I feel like crying? Doesn't he know I'm a published author? 'They're bunkering.' Johnny's voice, int eh front, was deep and low and easy as his seating position. He was unlimbered, seat hitched back into Tpny's shins. The backseat was asocoilogical study of territory. Chrissy was liemkwise lounging, but sideways, and his joggling feet, as unable to remain still as his fists, the knuckles of which eh cracked relentlessly,a sif trying to crack every bone in his body before moving on to Tony's. They ' the jostling feet- kicked Tony bit by bit. He felt unable to complain. He shifted away. He felt like shit. 'Digging what mate?' said Chissy. Joanne wasn't speaking. She ws all eyes, as she sometimes was aroud her family. Watchign the road seemd to give her sight a safe place to go. 'Not digging. Bunkering. It's when people try to tap off oil. They do it in poor countries, like Nigeria. They're doing it at the petrol stations, but fucking it up, and bang.' 'Jesus, bro, how do you know this shit? Oh, don't tell me. He reads that boring shit guardian, n ot the sport or the star like a cdecent person.' Momentarily, Tony thought he was talking to him, but managed not to tun to look. He began to hum, and tapped dsoemthing the approximated the sound sfrom his tongue o9n the plastic rim below the window. What am I doing? He thought. He hadn't thought for some time about his mother, in her hospital bed. 'Yeah, yeah,' said Johnny. Joanne was laughing. Tony guessed it was safer than talking. He wa ssure he could smell the barrel of the gun. SAcrid, oily, hot. He wiped his sewty upper lip to disguise his gulong, and then did so again. 'No nipple count in hoighty toity guardian, si there. Only tits there are the tits who read it.' 'Ho, ho,' said Johnny. 'Huk, huk,' laughed Chrissy, the sound barely making it over his ayrn. Itw as never reach his eyes, Tony knew. They evaded humour, josling in their sockets as his fingers did on his cracked knuckles. The laughter subside with the drawn out, harsh sound of a pet's final breath.

In spite of the flames, the night air wa sconsensing, its drizzle congealing into heavy rain then, with a scattered sound that forcibly remineded Tony's heart of ther gloch's bullets, it spoured into hailstones. 'Shit,' said Joanne. 'Fuckin shit.' Sewraong like a btrooper, thought Tony, o, more likely, like aganster. Trying to fit in. 'They';ve sent the TA to The Hills. New patients are being turned away, unless they're dead serious. Huk huk. Or dead.' Ohnny turned. From his relaxed position, the snarled twist of his abdomen reminded Tony fo apredator. 'What you on?' asked Johnny. 'Facebook.' 'What did I say abou Facebook?' 'Yeah, yeah. I know, but I've not updated opr nythig. Kepp your knickers on. I've just looked at my wall.' 'They track that.Get off it and in the forums. Find out what the Redc army are up. I want to know if they're in the local TA.' 'Yeah, Danb si, and Will.' 'Get in the forums,' repeated Johnny., turning back. Both his lps anmd his jacket sighed as they relaxed against the rest of him. 'We're nearly at The Hill,' he said, softly. 'I think som,' said Joanne. She had lowered her head and appeared to be trying to stare unbder the windscreen wipes, despite their arc reaching the base of then windshield. Their scrape had become a screech, at the speed they had now reached. 'Yeah, there,' she said. Blue light srefracted through the droplets the broken wipers were failing to erase, like the lights of evil fairies. Staring over his wife's shoulder, the pin point made Tony a Christmas kind of sentimental. Either yat, ir he just wanted to cry. Chrsitmas made him think of his mother's perfume. Thenc,e of her under the white linen, the beat of the heart monitor, the smell of disinfectant, the bacldnes, and the scar from her temple to the lumpiness behind her right ear. She was up there, somewhere, in the edifiasc eof the Hills that loomed into site. Eith it, at its base, he could see army jeeps, and green truck, dark enough to be melted into the night, bar the lights on the grill at its front. There was the luminous jacket,. Here and there, of the poluce, but they were spread, lose as the seeds for the kind of plant that might be seen in Avatar. Most of the figures he could see,a nd there weeren't many of thes, in the soured night, were uniformed in the army-truck green. By the flicker of grey in the general gloom, they were waving away the line of cars before them. An ambulance went by, all lights and sound and the sense of someone else's misfortune. 'Might not,' his voice wsas plugged by mucus. He cleared it with a huk not unlike Chrsisy's and tried again. 'Might not be able to get in tonight,' said Tony. 'He's right,' said Joanne. There was an edge to her voice, a siftness around of her words, perhaps of sympathy blurring them to gether, 'They're going to run us away. There's not way we get in.' Johnny turned again. A slower action, but coiled, ready. There was the working of tonmed muscels theer and none more so than his brain. By the sharpness of his eyes, it ewas ready. Tony could not bear to hold his gaze. 'We have o get in,' he heard Johnny say to his brother. Then he wsd reaching into his jcket. Then he was handing Johnny the gun. The gun. Outside, without the sun, the temperature was goiung down, but this was nothing against tehn dfall within the car. Sound seeedm to derpart, along with the warmth, and with Tony;'s ability to suck ion air. 'Sorry mate,' said Johnny to Tony, who didn't momentarily, realise he wqas talking to hinm, as he was staring at the gun. The single hole at its end seemd dto be an eye which, in its metallic tun, was staring at him. 'I'm not so sorry,' said Chrissy, the rasp of his bvoice nails that caughtTony';s awareness and dragged him back to the moment. Tpny's sight flicked to Chrissy, then away, then back to Chrissst. Away. Back. He couldn' look at him, nor anywhere else. He was caught betwtcta dn between, and, more so, between a haredc palce and the barrel of a laded gun. 'I'm going to shoot you in the leg,' said Chrissy. 'It's your choice where in the leg. If you paly difficult, it will be someplace with a lot of blood. Be a good boy, and roll up your jeans and let me shoot you near the bottom, and you get bth keep the whole thing. ASll of it, what do call. Yeah, all fo the limb.' 'What?' Tony tried to say. He didn't even get to a wha. Without brwathin, speaking had become difficult. 'No,' said Joanne. The wsn't breatjelss,m not like Tony's lungs, but itw asn't far off. 'Beep your horn,' said Johnny. 'No.' 'Beep it!' he shouted, His eyes, however, YTony could; tell with one flick of his own, where not unkind. He was sparing her. Tonmy had always been good at picking up the deails. IUtw as part of bein a writer, he guessed. Apart from this guess, all his mind could offer, detail wise was, I'm about to be shot. His penis offered more, as it had earlier, all of it liquid, and some of it spreading from his boxer shorts, and into his ejans. 'Aw, don't be such a bloody pussym,'; said Chrsiiyt. His nose was wrinkong upm, as thoughn trying ot get a sfar away from the smell of urine as it was able. In fairness, thought Tony, it was my penis. His mind had openede as wide as his bkladder.

{"text": "78 mph on the speedomter and feels, nonetheless, that he is going nowhere. He wishes he could do so more slowly. The sun is beginning to set, brushing the hills on either side of the road red, really slapping it on, in Tony's opinion. His wife shook her head and her cheeks darkened and she wouldn't speak. Above Snake Pass, the sky was beauty, a sight the socially exceoted version of perfect, like the faces of the women Tony had never bedded, but, though the cab of the corsa was lit, his wife had pulled down the sun-screen, on her side, and none of the light touched Tony. I was only teasing your mum. She likes it, he thought to say. He didn't. He already knew how this argument would turn out. She was speaking, needless to say, 'You think you need to be a child to be a writer, do you? What's that bloody saying of yours?' She didn't give a chance to say. ''A flexible mind; a creative mind'.' The sneer of her saying it didn't help, but he had to admit, it sounded like toss. 'Well,' she says. 'I'd like to see yo create money fro the solicitors out of thin air. Or any bloody manners. You're so arrogant, just because you're off with my mam, you didn't have tp act that way. It's my mam, for Christs's sake.' Tony couldn't help but think, Mum. 'She even gave you a sausage when the meat ran out. But you refused to eat it, didn't you, like a pouting, little kid, even though it was her last sausage.' She gave me a blowjob in the coat-cupboard. He couldn't say it. Instead, he glanced right and away, hoping to see the farm, squatting awkward as he felt between two carriageways, but seeing her outline, in its stead, an arora of darknes, despite the blonde curls of her hair, loose like a perm that had let itself go, as her stomach had let itself out, gone to fat years ago. She was shadowed, her hand swollen on the wheel with all the primacy of the driver. Me woman. Me in control. He grimaced a smile and didn't say anything and gulped and tried not to let the sound of it out of his lips. She always won the arguments. Tony couldn't get his mind to think it, but she was cleverer than him. He looked left through the window to the passing moor, limp in the seat as any passenger could be. I've been a passenger for too long, he thought. 'Look at that sunset,' Tony said, before he thought of her mother, again, and her curves, and the face he loved, a face like the sunset, a body better. The curves of her face around him. His wife didn't reply. There was the tightening of her lips, and that of her fingers on the steering wheel. They sounded the same, to him. The air in the car was compacted, the starta of memories and the years they had spemnt together pushing down on it. The linings of the car were rusty grins. He thought with satisfaction of the junkyard. He could almost see the fossils of what had once been them, a shared love, long kisses on a campus bed, any kind of lust. The looked like anemonas, floating before his eyes. He blinked them away. Give in. 'Look,' he said, as had many times before. 'I'm sorry.' She glanced at Tony. He was looking left, still, at the reddened heather slipping back and away, swallowed by behind, so he didn't catch her glance, but he felt it, not sharp but a cudgel too wearily wielded to really bruise. Her voice carried the sound of her giving up. The weariness was what really hurt, anyway. 'It's all very well saying your sorry, but you don't even know what your sorry for, do you?' I was right, Tony thought. I even lose when I'm trying to. 'I do,' he said, trying for earnest, as he had at the altar. He looked at her, hoping his blue eyes would carry what his intentions could not. Once she had thought they were pretty. Before, his face had been enough to paper over what she had called his 'fucked up' brain. She stared at the road, more, he thought, than she needed to. But, what did he know, he wasn't a driver. 'I shouldn't have been mean to your mam,' he said. It was the way she said it. 'It went too far. I went too far. You find things hard enough with them, with your family, and I've just made things worse.' Joanne looked again. A flick of hard, brown irises, being Stoned, he thought, before, ho-ho. She won't be a Stone soon. 'It would be nice if you actually meant that.' 'I do.' Tony attempted outrage. 'And I'd appreaciate if you didn't second guess how I'm feeling. It's not fair on me, to do that, when I'm just trying to be honest and find some common ground between us.' God, why? Tony wondered sometimes if he were a sociopath. She had suggested the same. His wife was a therapist, worst luck. There was a darkness inside him, he was sure, a cavity, and a stench in it like something small had crawled down in there and died. His wife often talked about the Inner Child, and Tony wondered if that were it - the body of a little me stinking up his superego. Only the scalp of the sun were visible, now, over the hils to the west, where they rose before Manchester, and clouds drifting from the sun's dazzling pate, as though its thought bubbles. An aquarmarine Corsa went by, several shades lighter than their own, passenger side unwound, a dog's head fluttering, gums and hair and skin, in it, like a pennant in the wind, a banner from before the age of white flags.

Pain was an express ridingt eh rails of his nervous system, derailing into his brain. His left calf looked slaughtered. Blood was a tumour on hi vision, like that in his mother's braiun. His mind spawned images, hallicnaitions, as she had seen, before they took her to the doctor. An office. S bold man. A smear of mustard omn his whirte coat. What has he been eating? Tony rememberd thinking. He was trying to tell him something about his mother but all he could hear was the thought that it might have been hot dofgs. This, for some reason, had horrified Tony. Tony screamed. Chrissy was opening his mouth.,Shouitng at him, but seemd to be saying, 'Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep.' Beep. Said the machine beside his mither's head.

A and E on your right, pal.' People were speaking. Teher were words. That's what happened when people were speaking. Right? The wordsc multiplied. Went up and up and ut of control. 'I feel like purple poo pyjamas.' Maybe that's me? Asked YTony, odf himself. He didn't have the wherwital to reply. He didn't have most of his left calf. Something was floating down toward him, too white to be unconsciousness, an angel, he thought, far away, hugh in the skya s the sun should have been. But no, there- it touched his nose- it was close. He didn't feel it. If it were an angel it eas the kind of size that coul dhvae danced on the head of a pin. He didn't have consciouens, he would have trealised had he not blacked out and been thinking,g instead, bye, bye, Mr. yellow sun. Part 2 Funnn Umber whununnnnnnn. These sounds and around them not much else, blank as the fin ger spacing on a page of text. Umbe whununnnn. Pain was in here with hin, Tony was sure, suree in a wway he was of nothing else, including that his name was Tony. Pain was here, and it would make itself known. The big entrance. Knock knock. Who's there? Funnnn Umber whununnnnn . 'Funnnnnnn Umber whunnnnunnnnn,' the man in the bed next to Olly said, not for the first time. Olly turned away, but only his head, and attempting to twust as little as he could of his neck. The shoulder injury, kicked there when he had already been kicked to the curb by looters, forbade craning. His eyeballs bulged, doing what his shoulder muscles did, swelling in the circled bandages of white. It was just as blank outside. It had been snowing for a week and the football season was two weeks from beginning again. Blue moon he thought. There hadn't been a moon since ths un went away. There wouldn't be any football, either, a this rate. That snow must be piling upo, he thought. It's well cold enough to settle. He was surprised by how little he missed football. He couldn't recall the last transfer rumlour he had heard, or at which point following the turning off of the sun tat he had ceased to care. Perhaps, itw as when he had gone out for tinned beans. 'Went out to get some beans, got done by some human beings,' he whispered. It seemed worth saying out loud. He laughed, but silent as the snow, and somewhat heavily. His shoulder jolted pain into his jaw, and he clenched it, feeling his cheek muscles writhing like snakes ina bag. 'How's the arm?' He twisted. Snakes again , he thought. 'It's the shoulder doc',' he said. He hadn't heard him come in. The doctor must have crept to the hospital bed as they did on TV when they were carrying pillows. 'Feels like merde, excuse my French.' The doctor picked up the board at the dnd of the bed. He stared at it. Olly's eyeballs had gronw used to watching ' little else to do in the long night of his recuperation- and he cpouldn't help but notice that the doctor's eyes didn't really focus. They were glazed. Olly remembered that feeling from school. Pretedning to read, trying to see up Lucy's blue 'lin dress. 'Sure,' said the doctor. Now his eyes came to staring at him, Olly couldn't recall seeing this doctor before. He tioghtened, his limbs, his throat, his heart, like a dish cloth being wrung. He felt sweat squeezing out. There was a lot of screaming in this hospital. That was to be expected, Olly jad told himself, time after time, and; go to sleep. Her copuldn't explain why the screaming seedm to be in the alls, or some of the shadows he had seen. I'm on edge, Olly thought, and shrunk furthert into the centre of the bed as the doctor walked up its side. 'Just gonna hve a quick look under the badage. Only at the shoulder.' Olly nodded. He tried to say, 'just don't get fresh and look at my neck,' but his windpipe had constricted until it was difficult to get air through it, much less the width of a word. 'funnn Umber Whunnunnnnn,' said the man in the bed next to Olly. The doctor crand as Olly hadn't, but more up, then sideways, tilted his forehead downward. It loomed, fran eknstein, monstrous.

{"text": "at least they didn't look like a witch again. 'Wonder what he's going on about,' said Olly, findinga crack through which to speak. The words were a croak and, perhaps, even less. The doctor didn't seem to be listening. 'Nice tat,' he said. 'Thanks,' said Olly. The skin under the bandage felt as though it wanted to crawl donw under the linen, wrap itself in it, cuddle a teddy bear. Itw asn't healing, but the sensation of the doctor's eye on it. There was too much staring going on for Olly. 'Blue moon?' said the doctor. A coldness had come into his tone that made OLly glance out of the window. He nodded and gilped as the nod pressed his chin into his collar bone, so much the better to conceal his fear. He felt naked, and ten hospital scrubs did little to cover it. 'A blue?' 'Aye,' said Olly. 'You?' A smile crowbarred out across the doctor's lips, revealing teeth that were wonky, broken in by the act of smile, Olly wondered. His mind whirred through images and came back, time and again, to the doctor holdinga crowbar, smiling with his broken-in teetyh. I think too much, he thought. The doctor didn't answer his question, but said, 'I'll be back to,' a pause was put down, a paperweight in the midst of the sentence, purposefully, left to weigh on Olly's chest. '' to check onm you a little later.' The smile had nither gone awaym, nor reachd his eyes. 'Sure doctor'' Olly left apause of his own, staring at the breast of the white coat. Normally, there was a name bade. 'Sure,' said the doctor. He looked down to his own coat. He looked up at Olly. He turned, walking away, not checking on the man who was saying, 'Umberrrrr.' 'Oh change the record, will you?' said Olly, as soonm ass the doctor had ;eft. The man stopped, as body straightening until he was an exclamation mark in the linen, a cotton hiss of surprise replacing his moans. His eyelids fluttered but did not opne, loike those a moth within a cocoon, like he was dreaming, and dreaing hard. Crimping his stomach and clenchng his kjalwines together, Olly raisede his abdomen and swung right, out of the bed. The floor tiles felt cold as gravestones beneath his skin. The chill rode his legs to his crotch. He was withered, he knew, by the ebd rest and the operations. He hadn't liked the look of the doctor. He had, Olly realiused, looked quite a lot like him. And I don't look like no doctor, he thought. He shuffled out to the hallway, and toiled his body around the jamb of the room's door. Strechers and wheeled bed s littlered the edges of the corridor. The hospital was lousy with patients. At the corridors end was the nrses staions and at this, no nurses, but the doctor and a green-jacketed man. Olly caught a glimse of red the colour of a devil's skin, beneath the jacket, and knew he wore a football top. It took another to realise he only saw this, because the man had turned,and was pointing at him. Olly thought it might hv ebeen the old, but he felt loike a shiver passing across the dead, blue skin of the floor tles, as he hurried awauy. Both his heart and his bvreath in his chest weer wfaster than his legs. The two men the doctor whow as not , Olly wws now sure, a doctor, and the other, both sang. He knew ths ong, from away football matches at Old Trafford. It reminded Olly of a week before, of lying aginst the haerdc lips of the curb, being buffeted against it like flotsam in astorm. There's nothing, oh no there's nothing,' they sang. Olly tuedn the corner of th corridor and slid into the toilets. The door cut off the song with a snap of wood finding its jamb. Olly looked left to right. No urinals. He was in the ladies. He entered a cubicle, turned, an with fingers made into fried sauasages by sweat and swelliung fear, turned the latch. The toilet door snapped. 'Oh no, there's nothing we like more,' Olly sharnk against the toilet. He was weing but the patter of it let him know he was missing the bowel. He could smell urea. Sweat and piss, he thought. The door boomed as it was struck, the catch creaked. 'Oh, no,' they were in full flow. HGearty as a miners choir, the toilets revoundeing with bounce of kicked plastic and merry words. 'there's nothing we ' like' more'top do'' The door shattered back. Olly shied, the inside of his knees knocking togther luike clonked heads as the backs of them his the toilet rim, and he plunged back into the piorcelianb. The lids were up, and slapped aginst his spine, dragging pain like the lengtnof a piano played, from the top fo his headf, to his ankles. By the smiles on both men's faces, that was the elast of the apin he would ace. He covered his heads, as the kicked came in, like rain heavy enough o be sideways, upwards, every which way. Every part of him became pain and he screamed as hard as h could, and for as long, but he no one came and he still heard, 'than kicking a blue, kicking a blue, kicking a blue Oh there's nothing n wer like more to do, Than kicking a a blue' ' tan kicking a blue'' ' than kicking a blue'' Funnnnummm Umbbbbbeerrr Whunnumm, it went, the sounds he heard, in a whine. Then in came the pain, a sun of its own in th edark of his unconscious mind, black as the bullet hole in hios bone. Then went the pain and the sounds, Funnunnnnmmm Ummmmmmmm' Fading out, or dwindling into his body, Tony could not tell.

{"text": "to him in an echo. Must be. He opened his eyes without realising, for some time that he had done so. The room was a blur, the details of which were paletted colours, spreads inherently into each other, a Matisse, a Picasso. The lines defined somewhat and, in the midst of them, floating above his hospital linen, white beliedm, was a caqt. The echo came back, disturbed by whatever surface it had touched, Must be the drugs. The cat that floated above his linen-embalmed belly was not purring, but appeared, to his ears, to tutt, then said, with a lisp hanging off the end of each word like a ruff on a babe prince, 'Arvand's realm is rootless, if you knows what I means.' 'Muist be the drugs,' Tony tried to say, but birthing speech from thought seemd as probable as a cat hovering the middle of ahospital room. As implausible as the Cheshitre cat. It wasn't grinning, it's doing the opposite, a frown of downturned lip and whiskers as if they couldn't be bothered to feel out the world. What would be the point, said its baleful eyes, an oddumber in colour, with irregular-line pupils the shape of trapped mosquittos,? The flatness of its skull only added to the impression of depression. It looked to Tony like a pancake that had been flipped on the floor. The Yorshire Cat. Tony had been there many times, and knew the look. It reminded him of his in-laws. 'Arvand's realm,' it repeated. '' is rootless, if you knows what I means.' With this it rose. Not with the shake and stretch of the domestioc feline, but allowing its spine and fur to remain flat. It barely lifted its tail as it pissed on the air above Tony's bed. All Tpny could do was stiffen as the droplets hung, yellowed willo-the-wisps, illuminating nothing but the disgusting nature of animals, to Tony, then, without so much as a bye-your-leave, the urine fell on his linen, and the cat left, padding out across the air. Like a boared ina wreck, he heard himself creaking, part of his went under, summeregd in bilged, rimy bitterness, and he cracked as he twicted out of the hospital bed. His right foot, at the ankle, on ths shin, felt itself crwbarred to the side, not with the wound of the bullet, but from a desire ' an image in his mind- of kicking the cat in the belly, naybe the ribs. He didn't notice that the bullet hole was gone and strode after the cat, out of the room, left away from the toilets and towards the lift at the nuirses' station. Somehow it had made it. Somehow it had reached the information button above the intercom to the lifts' left. Somehow pressing this was closing rthe door. How? Despite his injury because it had gone and left him whole, Tony could run, and did so, fi ngers unpeeling the air, claws all, as they reached toward the dwindling gap between the doors. The cat watched him with those eyes that couldn't give a shit and might wekll do that next time, instead of pissing. The doors closed. That was close, his mind offerd. He looked up at the pining of the floors. Seven, six, five, four three two one, then, ping, none of the numbers was lit, only the 'I'. Ping. Tony collapsed. The pain bit again, first his back then returned fully, with all of the familiarity of old contempt, and with it, 'Funummm Ummmmbverr Whunnnnunnnnn'.' Why am I sitting here, reading this? I think. Outside, thich, soft snowflakes moths flap against the pane, driven by a breeze rthat is threatening to become a gale. Light falls like value chicken soup from the bulbs overhead, long in their ceiling tile boxes, lonmg in their life, They've been going out, from time to time. The snowflakes were no loner angels biut bloated an dhairy and the front cover of Silence of the Lambs springs into my mind, A dead-blue woman, with a moth in hger throat. I gulp and continue readinmg. It is sielent outside, bar te rattling fo wind thorugh the struts of the building, and my voice was foregrounded. In places, I notice, like a dot-to-dot children's book but backwards, the progress of the white, falling flakes seems to erase some of the lights of the cityu, twinkling out there, om the hospital's West side. The snow didn't seem to be making every thing beautiful shrouding the ugkly, but erasing it, countless rubbers casually brushing out humanity. Now you see us. The book I am reading from is his, the man in the bed before me, his eyelids doing the jig of dreaming. The ma who usedc to be mine. The boomk is about me, barely disguised, my childhood,d my family.

It's about self belief, I suppose, but I have a well tuned bull shit detector, my childhood was good for this, at least, and I have long since stopped trusting clocks. Fucking, cocking clocks. The birds had attempted ot go home, to fly south, some tiem ago. It may have been a week, but when a wek hads days it could call it own, and not one long unfathomable night. They had taken flight as one. I had, at the time, shivered as though my backa dn nape and shoulders qwere made of feathers caught in tehrti mass updraught, and recalled pictures of swallows massing, so much so they were the sky and the blue or red sunset the dots in their world. Then, the sound of the flying hadn't left, and I realised they weer simply going rund and round' and round. I uessed it was th lack of sun, but the sound of their gyre, like Yeat's, neither widening, not coming to a definitive, second end, orbited until by teetn ground in their own circles, and the cogs pf my thoughts unsprung,a nd wheeled off on their own. I had come here, then, and collapsed against the side of soon to be ex husband, and cried tin ashaking silence against his lineen and listened ot the birds dropping, efatugiued, ferom the sky oen by one, their softening thuds as the snow fell, their increased falls as the snow increased,w iegjuing on their shoudlerrs as the sound of the breaking bone asnd wings did on my mind. Now, silence. If birds are defijned by their ability, even in short, chicken hops, to taker to wing, there were none left that I could see or ehar. The corpses far below the window, gently shrpiuded by snow as though could barely cover them with fingers frozen bu shanme, didn't ount. They would never fly again. Me and the corspses of pigeons, I think, all ttapped here. I put his book down on the bedside table. There aren't flowers, but on the front cover si a Laburnum petal, sickly yellow as his name ' Tony Stones, that sluiced light as the book came to a rest. A scene a day, just like our marriage, these last few months. It haqdn't., on some level, come as asurprise to find he would sacrifice their arraige for his writing. It had coenm as a shock to see how low he would go. 'Little shit,' I say, and hoep he can hear me, but shake my head and a tear slips out like atraitor from a castle's hidden pogress. 'Fuckin'' I can't go on. He never liked my swearing, but it isn't that. He has wet himself. '' shit.' I manage, coming back into the sentence as a knockout does to consciousness. He is rising in his bed. His shoulders and head first, into the pose of a paraplegic, then, swinging, sideys, his feet roll between the linen,a nd to the hard, cooling floor. They smack their, felled as logs. I imagine the calf. A meal of broken flesh beneath banaging, and a rupture. Was that a tear I heard. My eyes are dry, wrinkoing into themselves like salted slugs. It was arip, I'm sure of it. 'Don't,' I say, as he rises again, this time nothijn g like a paraplegic, unless one, who., by some m,iracel, ahad heale.d Now the tear is more perdsuaisive, an unhotchign of sound a flesh, a zipper in the reality fo the room.

I rise, by heart faster than me and reaching my mouth before th rest of my body cathes up;, and it, as much in control as miy mkind, spurts around bhe edge of the bed. He is walking out of the door.

The nurses are out, and grappling him up, dragging Tony toward his bed. The bed next to him is empty, and unmade, though the cirridors below, I know, are over spilling. Trypical hospital inefficiency, I think,m and am about to turn, to follow my husabd, when the lift door, with a ping, open. Inside, a cat sits. Its face seems to have an issue with teality, one which as set it not so much ina frown as in despair. The feline opens its pi9nk paw and bone-white teeth and hacked-hacked-hacked then vomited ont eh lift floor.All the while, he watches me. He seems to be saying, though spepch would be impossibvle through such a trail of vomit, and, for that matter, for a cat; you make me sick. The lift doors close and the floor indicator above them begings to flick through a semi circle of numbers. Eventually, the cat, accoridn got these, travels throught the 'b' and the numbers flick out, leaving only the 'i' lit. 'King Candy,' says the grill above it. I lean forward ina spurt as much as Tony's blood, feeling red and hot, abruptly. 'Why don't you just try being professional, eh?' I say. 'Have you got Kinbg candy?' says the intercom. 'Can I have you?' 'Sick little shit,' I say, but am unsurprised, and ris,e jabbing the 'I' off. It doesn't do so. I turn away fronmthe sound of it's static which has begun to resemble, discomfortingly, the breathing of a mchine. The lift, perhaps. I walk back down the corridor to Tony's room. ]# The linen at his crotch was wet. In part this was sweat, and was repeated in drips and daubs across his back and where the cloth met his l;eft calf. On the right, pf course, the bandage, which had been reapplied since his somnabuilism, sealed in the sweating. The nurses hadn't bothered changing the rest of him, his garments, the line, ditto the bin, or the bed next to hin, the blankets of which were lumped as though the ghost of whatever it's previous owner had been. In the the sour bubbles of indigdesgation from dr4eams too long, too long spent induced by drugs into sleep, memories of him came back to tony. Th shaven head. The 'alright ate' drawn out like the needle with which they had taken his blool,d while the could till be bothered. The farting noises, and stenches. Maybe he's still there, under the cover. Not so much as a ripple of breathing. Dead, then, but I can't smell him, so, no, he thinks. Unless his own stench, somewhere in between the chlorine of the moped corridor and floor, his sweat, his urine, an dthe odour of incipient disease tahtw as the speciality of wards. Tony wanted the linen, not to replace his onw; he could live with the smell of him, shaming as it was. It was the cold he couldn't bear, which seeped into him as he did into the covers. The snow was a thock yellow piss- line at the base of the window, beyond which everything was dying, lit by the long-life-lights of the hiospital which seemd, themselves, diseased, close to passing away, and went out regularly. They left an instant of shock, of black, when there was nothing left, now the sun wasn't coming back, then red lights could be seen, in halo's, auras of bulbs, ghosts of where the emergency llighting flickered, by the door, and out into the corridors, loike that along the passengerways on pkanes. Those had gone out, once, too and in the dark, Tony had his first thoughts of going with them. God hd turnded out the light on his way out. the snow flakes, for now, had ceased, leaving a crisp blackness like chicken skin left too long on the barbecue. The corportate blocks that could be seen West o the Hills, the Co-op, the Srndale the Hilton, had been going out, lso, one by one. ASfter God, it seemd, CEO's followd. The multinationals were leaving the building. Tony did not take this to be a good sign for those that were left behind He shivered, skin craqwling and rubbing his flesh in palm sized chunks, as though trying to warm itself. The btectonic lates of Tony coming apart. He sweated into his eys, and down from their gritted corners as though tears, but didn't dare raise his hands from the cloth. It would be colder if he did. The air would get into the bubble of fart and urea he had crafted in the bed, if he did. He wife walked in, looking like she was returning to a childhood bedroom. She blinked, and came back to her self, and had the expression of recalkling that he was no longer her own. She said, 'Jesus, you stink.' And crinkled her cheeks and forehead down until they met her nose, which spiekd. His teeth writhed against each other. Dhe could still cut im. 'Like I can do anything about it.' 'Christ,' she said, and grasped the sheets fromt h bed beside him in one long reach as loping as her legs. The bed was empty, like magic trick. 'Put this over it, at elats.' 'I can't move,' he said, secretly grateful for the heat he could already feel embalomng him. 'If you remember.' 'Yeah,' she stared ut at the window and, seeming to see nothing in it but herself, she quikly looked at the bin. Sh hated her reflection. Tony guessed it rememnided her of what she'd been through. 'Haven't those bloody nurses been in?' This was as much as a softening of tone as he could expect, or had, for some years. The hardening towards other., the twisting of the spike into other's flesh.

He said. ;'Been staring at these walls, waiting fro the power to go out. Bored stiff,a nd it's not just the cold..' 'Yeah,' she evn looked at hinm. 'It's freezing isn;'t it?' 'Gods, yeah.' He smiled so she might catch it. 'But you know me, obsessively writing, and I'm really missing it' He words stopped, a caravan trail cut of by the idnians, the remander of the sentence circling up in his mouth. He couldn't missing the freezing of her exptression, the calcification of years odf pressire. Her wjite, icy skin hardened until it seemed it might be a diamond. It had the loom of soemthign that could cut. 'You what?' Now, she was staring at him. He felt [words used for the aphixing of insects/butterflies]. 'After everything you've done to me, everything you've fucking taken from me, you want me to get you a bloody pen and paper. So ou can do more fucking damage?' 'A pen would be enough,' he was squirming, caught on the pins of her vision, her clawed hands hovering as if those of the Enperor. 'Why? What for? Why do you thiunk writing is' is'' she had lost the owtrds, or they wre hiding from her. Ton had sunk into his sheets. 'Who's going to buy a book now, eh? The world is pover and all you can thinking about is your la-di-da precious fucking writing.' 'I'm'' he almost said a writer, but his lips thought better than his brain, and said, 'sorry.' She shook her head, an avction some thwre between regretful andf hateful. She walked out, head hardly turned to the door before her legs and snapped through it. He heard her receding, along with the feel of his ehart in his chest cavity, the thrashing of arteries calming. She returned, abruptly, and they flailed, slapping his wrists full, fo blood. For a moment, as eh strode to the bed, he though he might strijken him and glimpsed what women feel like, at the hands of some one bigger and stronger, cowering into the bed. Instead, she palmed a pen down into the linen beside his shoulder, hissing, 'Fuck you, and fuck your writing.' Tony stared at it, pijtn closed to his eye, the pen as red as an incorerect mark in a school book. He felt sahme at douing something wrong, yet again. He looked up and she was gone, which was no surprise, given her rage and her size, he could barely miss his wife's footsteps, as she paced away. Additionall,ly, she had slammed the door. With fingers shaking between adrenaline and after effects of surgery, Tony took up the pen, turned to the book beside his bed, opened up the fronmt cover and, on the frontiscape, wriote 'bitch'. After thias, eh left what may be imaginede to be a line, and began to write out everything that occurred to him, since he had sat in the passenger seat on the way back from hismotehr in law, on Snake Pass. He didn't let the flash back go to before this. He didn't mention the blow job she had given hbim, her curved body, the line of her curved bottom and wide hips continuing around her bossom and finishing only wher her lips met his penis. He didn't mention that she smield around him as he came. I don't recall how I came to be here, befoe my mother in law, the decisions made along the way, the left and right and take the stairs and, yes, vicar, I do. I do.

'What did you do to him,' I say. 'You really fucked him up, didn't you?' The words are whispers but long, sdrawn out, and I imagine the blades of them piercing her insensible skin, her closed lids. I lean forward pinning them in. DShe miughta swell be the foll of who she is. 'Thought Larkin was giving ypou advice did you?' Not even a extra blip, from the monitors. 'I know you didn't touch him up, so how did he end up like this. Maybe you should have hit him. Hit him like I was hit.

I don't liook at the other beds, but I know the same is happening, to the two others. Her skull mis trying to birth her brains.

She stumble sin the dark, and in the red of the emergency lighting, and im, I guess, her terror. My throat is sore, rubbed hoarse by the air I retch, but I'm pretty sure not a sound is coming out. Talkjin g of sounds, despite the screaming, I can hear slithering. I manage to look. I would feel proud of this if there were any room for any6thign other than terror.

(how are theyall still screaming. Why have there lungs not given out as my mind has.) The screech, I think, of a witch, cold, unending,m inhuman, pointed at the end like cold nipples on acold tit. The whole world is csreaming, but the with ' and I see er, a silhgoette on a broom screeching across the hospital wall as though it is a starless night ' is not of this world.

Yet, across the wall.,,s she flees,a nd the tentecales of the shadow chase her./ They cjhase also the dimensions of this world. The wall bending, bowing, across th high spot of the shadow.

Now, I find my voice, but find that I am mewling, my lips shaking until the mew becomes a gibber. I have never gibbered before. I mak the door, and hoit the corridor as I slam into the black nurse. Her cheeks wrench back as I stumble away, her teeth an instinctive clench n the dark , and made vampiric by the lights at ankle level. 'What's the Hell's goping on?' Her head is tilted backward as she stares at me. Her hair is high and shining and looks lik it wants to jump off the back of her ehad. It will;, I think, if she looks in that room. She shivers as the silhoutee of the witch passes her. She turns, as the tentecale of shaow that follows the silhoutet, slides around the jamb of the door, and into the corridor. 'Run,' I say., according to my tongue. To my ears it sunds like 'um.' The movement of the tentacles toward the n urse is a soun d loike a sniff. I reckon that is just what moving between worlds soiundslike, and feel like slapping myself. I don't sed where it makes contact with the nurse, but see her face as it does so. Her cheeks seem to attain movement the rest of her face can't make. Her mouth is locked in an expression somewhere between terror and horror and listening to something that cn' quite be heard, but is there nonetheless. A soun on the tip of the ear. I guess it is entering her, because there is the noise of liquid patterin g to the floor. Not much. I hguess her uniform, her tights have soaked most of it. There is a smell, three parts blood, one prt faeces, and she is moving away from me, toward the wall. She reaches ou a hands. She has fin gernails painted red, the thumb nail painted green. I can't brwarhe, let alone reach out to her. What if the wall hears me? I feel, m omentarily, like Tony. She is drawn into the wall.

I jab the down buytton toward Tony's floor, and realise no screaming, only the heat-monitior beeping comes from his mother's room. Ping! I jolt. The lift doors open. Inside is the cat. It stares at me as though I have no right to use this elevator. Don';t I know, it;'s baleful, big, glowering eys seem to ask, that this is alift purely for felines. 'I'm bigger than you,' I say, and enter. I press. I would shrink away from the doors, the corridor where' my brain refuses to specify, but something happened. To somebody. With tentaclez that acme from somewhere. Somehow. Bt I don't back away, bedxause at my back would thn be anotherw all. We travel downward, the cat refusing to stop looking at me. I begin to hum to the tune fo the usak in the lift, before realising it is Somewhere Over the Rainbow, and I stop. The doors openm, I exit. The oords close and the nuimbers abpve the lift, after a moment, begin to flick downward as thouygh, iny absesnce, the cat has reached out a paw and jabbed away. Limbs shaking to as wide an oscvillation as my stride I walk to toward my husband's door, and hope the lioghts don't go out again. Dr Amin saw the shooting before it happened, in a way that he hadn't the sun going out, or his wife's suicide. He wasn't [sychci, his mindhaving no powers more unusual than being aworld leader in oncology, but his daughter's did. Yet, he couldn't bear doing anthing other than extending her life when he shouldn't, an dpressing her favourite teddy into her arms, andletting her take away the sun. Anubody who lost a daughter, he bthought,w atching the two men at the edge of A and E, one of which he knew carried a gun, any grieving father knew how dark the wolrd became whentheir only daughter fading out of it. His lived, but she had taken the sun with her. For Dr Amin, it was six of one and half a dozen of the other. He was haunted by the ghost of his opwn guilt, his shame hanging off him like soaked clothes ' it was [particularly heavy on the worsts and heels, and he walked with a s;ouch that he knew the nurses' attributed to faitigue. The nu8srse wre stupid, in his opinion, and not because ethy lacked his medical degree, but beceuase- couldn't they see what he'd done. Wasn't it written over him. Weren't the shadows around his eyes, the bags, exactly enough alike the hole where the sun should have been to tell it had been him. He, was sacrificed a sun for a daughter? Idiots. The two men were watching another. A man that must have weighed their combjedn weight, he used to play rugby league, he had said as soon and as often as possible, for Helen, Dr Amin thought, maybe. He didn't care. The man, despite his height and breath and lack of hair was as bad as dead. There would be nothing good about it, reckoned the doctor, and esp[ciellay not for the walls of the A and E. He had seen these two go about their business, this week, at the hospital. Dr Amin mind wa s aswmap the dead he had seen sunk down into, their eyes lit liekt hose in that film his daughyrter, Sabah had liked ot watch, Retun f the Thing, or something, e couldn't recall throiugh the miasma and stench of his thoughts. Memoirs of those that had died were flies, eating at his skin, it itched, as thoughn they had impregnated hom all over with shame, hot rash, quick to claim him. He ws responsible, after all. His wife had told him. She had understood, at every point, medical degree or not. It ad taken some time to convince that the Piggy Brin surgery contained not a hint of pig, and she wouldn't listen, either, after he had told why he though the light of the world had gone out. That evening 'wasn't it always eveing ' he had found, hanging int eh cupboard. He had opened it, for a shirt, for his shift,a nd had gone in anyway. Why not? What was the point of not doing so? If anybody deserved to see the sdead and near dead, and everyone else who would die, anyway, as humanity inevitably dwindled ,wasn't it him. The good doctor Amin? His family had been so proud of him, until his daugther got brain canvcer, and his wife a noose and a stool. The rugby player had refused to join the men's Red Army. Red Army Red Army Red Army, he had heard the singing. Each time he heard it, it jad grown louder, filled more rooms. The Red Armyw as srpreadiong like the feel of the rash on his skin. The rugby player had refused. Football, Dr Amin had herad hinm say, wssn't his game. Wrong shaped ball. Played by pansies. The rugby player was the kind of man who knew his own mind. He wouldn't ;ater, when it was collected in places on the orange of the piant fo the A and E wall. To the untrained, it would appear to be soup, let alone to the brain dead. The lights went out and in the deeper dark (it reminded Dr Amin of an open rectum, but then he had exzaimed enough pritstrate glands iot to recognise the way his own opened with fear, every time the lughst went out) there was a flash. Light returned, momementraily, ina way that hadn;'t been seen for some time, however long it had been since that dusk. It was difficult to count, without days.

The red of emergbency lights clicked on, soenwhere, thought Dr Amin around the level of the Achilles heel, and his blood was slick blackness oiling gthe walls. Thick oil pint, though, in palces, a GCSE art project, improperly mixed. Gloopy. The nurses were screaming, and that didn't help the patients. Keep calm and carry on dying, thought Dr Amin. Don;'t waste your breathe, it's also a wastew of heat. All the plugs in the A and E were attached to electric heayters and they glowed like a new level fo hell. The cold one. He heard the footsteps of the men, blending with each, the noise of one chasing the sound of the other's blending, like a dance omn the run. 'Red Army' a voice shouted. 'Help him doctor,#' a nurse shouted. 'There's really no point,' said Dr Amin. 'Help him,' shouted a patient, possibly the rugby players' girlfriend. In the dark her tall prettiness was reptilian, the thrashing of her fakse eyelashes like spiders drwoning in a bath. The tears would be coming, and would not be unseen, whene the back up popwer supply fired the hospital. It had been doing so too muych, for too long. The firesw oulnd't burn for ever. 'There';s really no point,' said Dr Amin./ A nurse was grasping him, up against his face her breath was heavy with cigarettes and a cloying taste, as though she had been eating all the deatn she had seen. It kicked what felt like an organ inside Dr Amin, one ddiseased and bloated an d tender. He wondered if it was his kloathing. 'There's no point,' he shouted and the swll of his voice pushed her back, her fin gers nails scrapong of his white coated arms as if they had been all that had kept her pinioemnd to a cliff's edge, and it carried on outward, prapitic burst boiling with his rage. The lights came back on. The patient lay on the bed, what was left of head lying above his shoulders, patently dead. His brains didn't have the good crharce to skulk way, but hung there in the light like a pervert caught in their act, red handed, exposed. Dr Amin walkeds away. To the writer in Tony, the turning of nature, like a worm that had swallowed them all, from light to enl3ess night, waas not a surprise. He could comepete, or felt he could, with any other writer, he hgad game, he had thought, at least until his sales figures had come in, and the lack of quotes from any reputable news source, with any but nature. Nature would arrive before his eyes, through the window of a a caf', or the jagged pill of aconversation overheard on a bus, and he knew he couldn't compete not with athast. Itw as so real. He wriote now, a standard apolyapse novel set in a world where the Russians tthreatened to turn off the pipeline to the west, where the Brotsh were said to be invading Iceland, for the thermal springs, you knbow, with the way the internet loading signils went round and round to no avail, just, he thought,, like the clocks, and always ended up on This page cannot be loaded, as the clocks always ended up ionb It's nighttime, obviously. He got the details, but the sum of it all, the coldm the fear, the wind outside and the snow shaking the building until he felt he wass in a world that was an upturned snow globe ' the metap[hor for that, the simile to describe what was happening to hum, he couldn;'t grasp. Nature had got him, the writer, as much, it seemed, as it woiuld get all of them, humanity, and sooner not later. He had tried not think that standard question of the dqwindling out ' why, btu hd ended up with ' why not, what would matter if he did, or didn't. Why? He thought. The outside moaned with wind, as if the question disturbed the air, asf it had better things to do with its time, like freeze. Like me, Tony adds, and tries to write and wishes he could have drink. Instread, he plows on, throught eh soun d flurries against the window, and thunder booming like the knock knock of God, on the building. 'Like the knock knock of God,' he wrote, unable to come up with nythgn superior, 'and we tighten in our bed, wishing gnat's arses of ourselves, and ask , who's theer. I can hear it.

It looked like a witch on a broomstick, on the move, if thatw itch was on her way to weight watchers. Ton y didn' know how her broomstick coped. He was unsure if his ars would hold out. He sharnk in his bed, receding into the linen as if his body was getting smaller, trying to Benjamin Button itself back out of existence. The shadow fo he widtch did the same, fetchin up in the bottom corner of the room, a rat trapped but terrified as Tony was of rodents, or had been of witches, fro that natter, when he was small; little, As he felt now, all but his heart which felt as though it were trying to eat him in big, monstrous, flailing, bites, big mawed, jaws full of blood. Tony closed his eys but the blood was there still, and he realised that he saw red because the emergency lughtning was volcanic cracking through the split in his eyelids. And because he could hear what sound like flesh in the wall, moving, slow, but not slow as tumour, thought he was sure that, if he opened his eyes, that was what he would see. He could ehar the wall creaking, occasionally cracking as the boarding and paint gave way, to its prgresss. The witch had stopped screaming and had taken to sobbing. Her voice was as little as childhood half remembered, distant, misted by sentimentality. @please,' she said. The sentiment was despair, thought Tony. 'Please let me live.' The thing in the wasll, for soemreason Tonyw as sure it was red and had tentecales like secondary growths, could be heard eatinbgnher in reply, and her to cease talking, an go back to the screaming, which stipeped not in the gradual turning down of a volume, but in a gulp, as if a larynx box had been swallowed. YTiony forced his eyes closed, eyelids against each other until he swore they should swap places, as in aline dance, so close he didn't see the anemic yellow daubing the pale hosptoital walls, and screamed him self when his wife tapped him on the shoulfder. a We lie wrapped in our smells iuntil they are as much of onbe as our bodies. His farts, the must from below my shoulders, between my breast, vague but there yet, between my les. His penis is attempting to become onbe with me, also. It's always been this way. To begi nm witgh I told myself that itw as to stay warm. The temperatiure outside has been dropping ubnstreadily, in leaps of frost spital is now bound in snow. Th etenmperature inside has eked away ' ever since the turning out of light I jhave thought of temeperature as something that will be fdrittered, like the food, or money to a miser. And so, I allow hiom to cluytch onto me as he did through the mornings of our marriage, doewn the years, his penis firmly wedged in my cheeks, and he moves it, irritating as a scratch that is actually an itcg,. As though I will allow him to relieve him srlf on me. The sick bastard. I can't bring myself to leave this bed, not to shower, only to piss. When it coems down to humanbity fading out with the central heating, having a shower sesm the least of my concerns. What can I say by way of an apology, for my appearance, my stencg, fgoiun back to him. Sorry? Who the fuck to? It isn't my imagination, peole a\\re disappearing and after that screaming I'll hold onto anything, even a little shit like Tomny Syoneds. Or should I say let him hol,d onto me, and put his thing up between ,my buttocvks, playing like a tramp wih his piccolo, for sympathy, a little charity? Can you help me out mate. Am I Sorry? No. The lift music had always irriated Dr Amin, and having worked out what it was didn'yt help put the irriation behind him. Somewhere Over he Rainvbow, but played backwards. It discommoded Dr Amin. Rainbow. The. Over. Somewhere. Where, he couldn't help but think. Couldn't it be more specific, describe the overgrown savana grass, the dark, fecund wood, the desicated air that hung lambenmt with tiny, mote-like tumours, as if dancing dust, but a smuch dancing dust as asbestos, the shrivelld laburnum pods, orange on the floor like dropped rotted sweeities, the old kind you used to buyt in the airport, '. Airport before it became Mibai, and '. Airport. Buy them in lines, he thought, like pills. Dr Amin glanbec down at the lift floor as the song worked its way to Somehwre. The cat lay cuirled in the corner, frowninga s it slept. The cat had told him where once, given the plkace a name. Arvin, or something. Dr Amin tried to not to think about that but found himself unable to. He thought too much, his wife had often told him. There's no such thing, he used to say, there's sjust thinking about the correct things. And thinking about the useless stiuff. He'd been wrong of course,. And her body, hanging aginst al th laws testified to that. Ping. He used to sreride this corrdir. Thatw as what doctors were good for, a look, a sense of confidence that spreadf to their patienys.

{"text": "She sighed. He could measure of their marriage, these last few years, by the sound of his wife's sighs. As with the rings in a tree, they came more regularly. 'Maybe next time, you could just think about why you're doing it.' Her head tilted, eyes still on the dead-skin-grey tarmac. It was pocked. They'd be re-laying soon, he guessed. He wished it were that easy. 'Look, they can be difficult, my family, and maybe you felt under pressure and felt you had to act the big shot writer. But next time, just tell me when you need a break, yeah?' Tony smiled, the grin spreading across his cheeks and into his limbs, through his stomach. Losing was worth this relief. The sigh, however, was back. 'It would be nice if you had just a little self awareness.' A year ago her tone would have softened, now, become encouraging. But there had been too much water under this particular bridge; the support had washed away. 'Yeah?' His stared down into the footwell. The sun was getting in his eys, he supposed, and he was finding it difficult to swallow. 'Yeah?' He tried the gulping again, but couldn't. 'Yes,' Tony said. ' 'I'll start a journal, like you said, and I promise I'll try'' I'm unhappy - the thought is unsummoned - and I'll never be happy with you. 'Don't try,' she said. 'Do. You're setting yourself up for failure, again. I could do without anither one of your failures.' Loser. He licked hs lips. This turned out to be the wrong thing to do. 'I don't see anything wrong with trying,' he said. 'Some of us aren't perfect, all knowing counsellors, you know.' He forced the sword counsellor at her. Sje insited in therapist. Her head cocked and gave a one-ways sliding shake, like the shutter on a cell door slid closed. Her jawline clenched, with the same kind of metallic grinding, he guessed. Tony had the feeling that he was on the wrong side of the door, and that she wa swalkign away, and his voice became high pitched, as he shouted. 'We can't all be bloody perfect lie you, can we?' The words echoed back to him along with the thought- and not for the first time- we do it to ourselves. It was line from a radiohead song, though he coldn't recall the title. It wasn't creep, though it should have been. She didn't look at him, she wasn't coming back. Instead, 'Get in the right lane, will you? Jesus.' But then, 'I never wanted you to be perfect. Just to be decent. To be someone I could trust.' Red lights ahead. Car crash, he thought. She beeped the horn. He said, as she did so, 'You can trust me.' Tony said it dsoftly, and, momentarily, he hoped she hadn't heard him. 'Trust you. Yeah,' she laughed. 'Trust you to stab me in the back, and what for , to put me in that book which sold how manhy, how many copies was your integrioty worth, eh, three hundred? F---k you.' The swear word wasn't the beep of passinbg motorists, but awhbine, like that after a hard slap. I lost her a little each time she did it, the sound of what she said, reality. As with a slap, his face reddened. Tony had talked to her about her swearing before. She had called him a stuck up southern a-------e. That he should know the difference between sweaing about something, and swearing at someone. He didn't hear the profanity,now, only the flood of hot blood in his ear. Each year, the water line got higher, and felt hotter, like global warming. Tony felt the flush before he knew he was angry. Tony's teeth, in his jawlne, were ashed clinker below a fire. 'I told you years agoi, didn't I, you're writing isn't worth it, all that effot,. You're not all that,' she glanced at me an dher lips twisted on that side, in my direction, as though parts of her face were enjoying ths. 'You're okay, but your writing is nothing to write home about.' 'Stop it.' He said. 'Yeah,' her tone was light, words adroitly stamping. 'you should have, but you didn't did you? Happy to steal my life, my secersts and tell them to the world, for your f----g special s---t of a novel. And when were you planning ot tell me, eh? Whe nyou'd won the booker f-----g prize?' She laughed. 'Stop.' I said. 'And what? Let you out? Youw ant to walk? You're lucky I've given you a lift, I could do with spending as little tgime with you as possible, to be frank.' 'Stop.' I was fgin ding it hard to find any other words in my mind. My fingers clutched at air and found my palms and they were sweating. 'Fine,' she said, and swereved left without indicating to the hard shoulder. The traffic about them became a blur of beeping. Joanne raised her middle finger to the pasing cars. 'Run awau like you've always done you coward. You're happy to write 'The Triuth' areenb't you just, you just can't face up yto it can you?' Myt finger slippd around th car lock before realising she would driuve away. Hitch hike managed to snake into my thoughts and I vrealised I couldn't. 'Go on, get the f--k out.' Whine. 'Stop swearing at me.' She laughjed, tarrish and thick, a sound like drowning in petrol. 'And what the f--k are you going to do about it?' Car crash, I thought once more. 'Stop swearing at me.' 'Oh you southern, pathertic prat.' For some reason, it was the last that Tony heard. She had stopped swearinga dn he belatedly realised gthis was because my jands were around her throat.

A lick of red shoes together. Hecould jhave seen the cat raise its head and stare at him and an exptressionb come ovcer its lips that could almost be described as grinning and certainly could be descvbired as 'painful'.

This si no time for pissing around, he thoguth., and wpould have grinned, as haqd the cat, but he had never been one for puns. Now, it was time to take his daughter from the oncology ward, and lock her ina cupboard. He stood over her. Thatw as the inaccuracy of his stride, at once like tahtn of a giant among men (head of his field, wprld oncology expert, lured here by anew hospital, his own wing, a free hand in research) then hobbled, less than a goblin (murderer of a dead wife, killer of a innocent child, ender of the light If he listended carefully, he could hear all this sid in the accent of Russel Crowe. ). He lokomked down at his daughter, wiping a hand over his face. It havered over the stringy bumps on his cheeks and upper lip. He realised he was unmshaven. In the low light of the ward, his daughter was the spit of his wife. There had been that, as wel as the faeces and urine, let loose by her corpse, as it swung. A chip off the old block, his mind tried, in the place of the spittle, trying to forget the way it had it's own smell, as he held his face to hers, after he had cut her down, a little like mackerel, the faintest hint of garlic. (her shit hadn't smelt like this.) A chip off the old block but for the wedge of cancer in her head. The aame nose. The sma eeye,s though they were bnow closed. Not the same pitiarity gland. Watching her, he stiled. He saw litrle of himself in the child, like staring into apoolm without reflecyion, in the centre of a shawoed wood. He put too staves of arms beneath her and lifted Sbah and her teddy Winnie, from the linen. He turned and her platcy gown flapped aginst his arms like sloughed off dead skin. He hadn't felt the cold for sometime, but her skin felt chioll to him. He thought he spotted putplre dots in the dusky alcoves at the conmers of the rooms, like wilo the wisps trapped and searching likem fleis for a away out. He pulled the tripod on which pylopmned her drips and thw wires to her monitors with the had that held her head, his searing finger downward curld around its metal stenm. Beneath it, one of the wheels squekwed like a mouse that had recently lost its mind. He walked throught he door, dowmn the corridor and to his office, closing its door behind him with a a thin click, like the sound his teeth used to make one set against the other, when he usedc to notice the temperature. As a child, the age of the daughter he carried, he used rto the think his stuidy would be magonhy, like those of the English in the miovies, with a thick red cushioned chair, like a rolled up dung beetle, and a desk so big he could have saile to Sri Lanka on it. Instead, it was clean, as disinfected as a corpse, faetol in the centre fo the hospital. It did have a lockable cupboard with its own ventilation and air conditioning, deep and filled with fiels, and this he needed. He had a long way to go, he thought, at least it must be a long way, musn't it, if it wasn't, the distance, inits tininess, was mind boggling. The Other Place siply couldn't be near. He set his daughter as comfortably as he cpould in the corner fo the cupboard, her legs like disconnccted wiring crooked out from her abdomen. He straingethenmed and coveredc them. He didn't need to sert her teddy back against her. Somegow she held onto Winnie, as tight as she was failing to do with her life. The teddyw as yellow but apart from in tbhis shared nothing with ist fecal namesake, being stringy, and beaten and as close as a teddy could get to looking luike a tramp without it semlling of urione. Sabah had felt sorry for it, he knew. Like her mothegr, shet took in strays. Like me, Sr Amin thought, It had been her money, or more precisecely (and remindedly) her family's money that had powered him through medice school, their coins slipped to him as though credit into tht e slot of the old meter oustoide the flat they usedc to own. They had been unhappy, theer, he remembered, It had been shit. His fiungers didn't linger on her. They had one back to the strange, external rhyrthm that had possessed them, earlier, as though they wre vaguel;y bored of the rest of him, and he could only distract them for so long. H3e didn't linger on byer cheesk ofr the nose like her mohers. Or the side of her lips that carried their redness as though they had been open and astrevhed and screaming recently.

There ws a crackle like that of a contened cat and the cat ' Dr Amin knew its voice ' said 'Arvand's realm is rootles, i9f you know what I means' and the doors slid open wth the smootnes of losing conmsciounses under anaesthetic. The cat sat to attgention in the centre of the lift. Dr Aminstepped around it and sa I the coner to its left. Not wher it had been. It wanted nothing of its warmth. He did n't deserve the charirty of anuthign on Allah's earth, but itw asn't that. the cart freked him out. As the lift doors shut, he rose and pressed the emnergencty stiop button and resaeated himself in athe puddle of cold tiles and weaited for the power to cut, as it often did, and the emergency light to kick im. He knew what he would would, had seen it before, though the hospital did not have a basement. The mortuary and crematoroium was on the same level, connected by a glass tunnel, allow with all of the service de[artments and the boiler, et al, soemthign to do with the hardness of the gorund on which the foundation s had been laid. There wasn't a basement, but under the red glare of the emergency lights, a level below ground floor lit itself, on the panel in the lift. It said, clear as a powercut night, - 1.

He tells me to piss here and is half joking, I think or not oking at all. There's a deep vein of perversion about him, has always been., but it could be the warmth he's thinking of, rather than with his cock, though the odds would be on the latter. Whcihever way, brain or penis, I have liong been of the opinion that it's a cock doing the thinking. Still, as into the warmth of opur pressed bodies, it starles me how easy it is to give in, to sink back in, to be married again, like the ring on his fin ger suggests, and the bareness of mine denies. I am clothed, now, jkacket and all and don't want to rise. There's no beatin the chill, it's in my bones, they need, by their feel, isnulattion more than my flersh, and I've liong thought I'm fat, and he's long said nothing to deny it. I rise, still, stabbed by the insistent needling of my bladder. Everything it abtrsise. Discommoded is the word to use here. It is walking into a slate wall. The cold is harsh on my cheeks, the lips, down my gullet. I'm swallowing it and walking does little good, forcing feeding more.

The words raise an image of him, but he has rolled awau, conmtent in his own heat, and the divot of it I have left behind. He loikes to call himself lazy, making of himself an excuse. I remember how much crap I let him get away with, and it drives me parallel to the window, but I stop. My eyes are caight by a fleet movement, down and to the right, and they in turn tifg my body.

Snow, I had forgotten it was snowing. How, I don't know. Perthpas this is like saying I had forgotten thei was air outside the window. It had become part of the landscape, nothing more.. It ewas a man, though, of that much my eyes were sure. Clothes had become important to me, like a leper with their skin, I am forever checking that my sleeves cover my fingers, my hems my heels, my hair tucked greasily as strips of old rag into my collar. Not cuts noweher, no holes. No, He was wearinga vest and a pair of boxes and either socks or snow clingin g where he had trodden. As good as a ghost out there. As a pedestrian to roadkill, I wanted to keep walking, ignore, him, but he had twitched, he lieve,d and I couldn't. The inconveniec of my shoivering limbs increased as I realised I was walking toward the stairs, the doors to which opened without so much as a creak, which they good have done, in all fairness, with all this talk of ghosts. It ws hard not to feel that the hospital was haunted, what with everybody going missing. It yhad been two days since I saw a member of staff. Nuirses, I thinl, amd step back, allowing the staoirwell door to close, sealing beside my nose. They could ring down. I wpuldn't have to go down. I walked to the station at the other end of the corridor. Spread forms, pens, than k you cards, instructions pinned to the wall. Emergency call 42. I pick up the phone, press the receiver to my ear. It is aking purring sound. Not beeps, pressed together for heat, but purring, as that of a cat, ;ike the soun don the the lift's information. 'What is wrong with this fucking place,' I scream, and ramm the receiver aginst the handset, which skitters off the counter loike a startled cockroacj,. Amd falls to the floor takin, a snaking second afterweards, ythe receiver with it. If Tony had been with me he would have blanched at the swear word, the soutern twat, and looked awy as though admonishing me with the lack of eye contact. The silebece of the corridor sounded like it ewas doing the same. Abruptly I couldn' hear the beeping of montiotrs., the buzz of elecrtrics badly connected, the flicking of long, inductrial lightbulbs. I round the wooden hem of the station. It, alone on the furntiuute ios smooth, well dusted, like a dress on a corpse. I open the door behind it. There is a creak, but not iof the door. Rope, I reckon, though I can't see it beyond the tights, the nurses dress around her tighted knees, the polished shoes, the right of hcih winks as her body swings delicately in the breeze I have brought with me. I think , sorry to disturb you, as my eyes widen (I can feel them on my pale face, like sptreading, darkening ink stains on paper). I can't see her head, only the long lank hair that falls on her navuy blue shoulders, obscuring her name badge, and the fuzzx of her features remnind me of dreans when I know it's me, but I cab't quite see. I let the door shut in my face, and allow its impct to strike me out of the room. It's no more than a cupboard, really, I think. A tiny little cupboard. Just a cupboard. A cupboard. Cupboard. I would have thought I was in shock , hut, of course, I didn't, and turned and walked away. I could have blanaced a book on my head. No shaking. If there was anybody left to wurtness me they might have described me as stately. I had allowed a, little of what my bladder had to offer out into my knickers. The daintiness didn't last long. As I stumbled down the stairwell, a zombie would have been ashamed of my gait. The concrete steps bit at my heel, chipped away at my resolve. I slowed. Was I sure? I turned to the door on level one, and pressed through, and stopped. If I wass honest with myself I had heard it before, but had chosen dishonesty not to hear. The chant came up, not trhough the floor boards, there were none of theswe, but seeped through the skin of the hospital, a heartbeat through ribs and epidermis. The chant of, 'Red Army.' Red Army. Red Army. In a beat, beat-beat. My mind thoguth of the drums of the deeps of moria, the bridge of khazadum, the nameless sfear, and I ignord it. I whistled to myself. 'Build me up butercupm,' possibly, by the Temptations. Anythign but the soun d of the 'Red Army.' I was beside myself ' my reflection, without realising I redached the window. I jolted.

I whispered, not too loud., tnot loud enough to be heard, but loud enough so that I could not herear them, below, in the depths of the Hills. I had heardc it somewhere, I thought, couldn't get it out of my mind, I hoped. Itw as better than other tunes. There was a ded man in thes snow. It was nearly definitely a dead man, though the snow was the same candour as what I thought of as skin, as boxed shorts, and as the socks, and his eyeballs were rolled, erphaps, because there was nothing of asn iris about them. It wasn't a body was it, though, it could it be that the snow had now covered it, while I watched. It wasn't one of the ta's I had seen on the way in. There was no way to be sure of this, was there. No way to know if I'd imagined him staggering out of the hospital, his limp, the scuff in the snow by the door I could still see. I was one floor up from the hillock of white and th dchant of Red Army was one floor down. I couldn't., could I? I had walked passed road kill that wasn't dead, as a child, many years befor eon a country lane, mortified in a way that it wasn't (itw as still twitching,lolling, salivating onto the tarmac, along with the blood and thw orms of its guts) at the thought of someone seeing me there, movi ng its body. I hated to be seen. I couldn't leave him, as I couldn't leave it, and yet did, my conscience a clawing weight at my back- mlike the silhoutee in the hiospitl walls -, tryuing to drag me aaroudn and down the stairs. I couldn't go down there, and thatwcouldn't was bogger. 'Red Army;' the ground flor chanted. 'Why? Why?' I whispered. I had forgiotten the rest of the lyrics. (occasional silences, breaking rthew gunshots and their echoes) With a click the emerfgnevcyt lighting came on and, with it, the -1 on the list of butons. Finger shivering as though he were admonishing the number, Dr Amin pressed it and closed his eyes. The red of the ankle height lights dressed the stairwell up like a brothel. A flush paints my nape and cheeks na forehead which has nothing to do with the lights, not even shame, for a change, but come sof panc, and is everything to do with a a state of emergency. My body is ain a state, my heart ratcheting about my rib cage like a ball in a pinball, seweking a hole, and a bonus. Momentarily I realise that etche d onto the walls are straight boughs, and dopping pods, as though from a canopy fo trees unseen not because it dpesn't exist (it doesn't exist, does it, my mind manages) but because the ceiluing of the stiars, the storey above, cuts off the vista I can see. (I shouldn't be able to see it, should I?) A moment later realise the cryuing sound I can hear come s form the silhouette of a child ' a girl- s bent retching beside one of the bughs, upon a knee of shadow that would take the shape of roots, if it were not cut off by the concrete frloor I stand upon. That is solid. Despite therg a sole and socks between me and it, I am sure of this- that my footing ios comcrete. From her little black mouth, from the the concave shap[e that I can only assume is it's voiding, a clump comes, like macated cereal, anf fall from view. As a child, as I do now, I hated crowds. Am hyperaware, the prescence of others like arassh of fingertops , whether ot not they are cloise enough for contact. They had didscomforted me, crowds, at every gathering I was forced to atgend, except once, when I went to my school hall and wartxhed a shadow play. Then, they, classmates, teachers, all, disappeared. How a scsene that looked less real than a T.V's, or that which closed in about my huddled shoulders, the rootish hardening of my cerosslegs, took my mind, how two d fin gers can reach put and strip away my consciousness, bending all of me into the canvas on which itw a splayed. I didn't know. I don't kniow now and it does the same. More real than a child with depth, the silhouette, and it's a girl, her pig-tails drooped as tshe vomited. By the darker darkness of the hairt's shadow, I can see they are uinwashed, lank, greasy, even before she manages to vomit on the tatterd end of one of her tails. She straighten in a snap, like atwig broken, but backward, and turns. Her eyes are unseen but I kno she is looking. Her mouth is no longer concave,a nd I imagine a thin line that is beginning, just, there I can see it, to tremble. Her ears are not visible,a md would not be bending toward what she can hear, whatever it is, but they may was well have been. She ebnds all of her ill will upon it. By the grip of her fists, she is gathering up her hatred. By the contriction of her shouldes, fear seizes her, and is squeezing. Like toothpaste, slow and gloopy,. She begins to run, past me on the wall to my left and, by it, not through the closed door to level 1, but between the jamb closest to me.

Not urine, unkess it has orifices for it back and front. I can smell opened flesh. The bluest of steaks. Time of the month. It is sniffing, and liquid is caught in the sniff, spurting -too quick for gunge. I am carried on the liquid. I am sure of it. I run. The words 'speeding faster thana midnight train' cross my mind. It is from a song. I dn't have the time to remember which. The trees of shadow-pupptery landscape pas sby quick as the slats ona it's track. I can hear the thing behind me begin to ran, also.

I sound like darthn vadar having an asthma attacxk. The thing behind me doesn't seem to need to brethe, by the sound s of it, only to sniff. I am closing on the girl as she goes though the next pair of doors. The swing inbto my slappouing hand and my right wrist gives a pela of pain at the impact, my shpoulder rdcoiling as i9 burst through. Then door closes with a sharp, gunpowder crack. The girl has stopped. There she is, beside a curtain whih shrouds a bed. She has collapsed on her knees before it. I remember the cfreatuer behind me doesnm't need to open the door. Ot would pass asround it, as it eos around this reality. I wish it would take the longest way around, having nothing ot do with this world of mine, but I can hear it. I realise, in this ward, mon its wall,s there are no shadowpuppetry trres. The girl is sobbing, but not around vomiting. I can hear the pop of drool from her nose. She says, 'please, please, no.' I guess she likes trees, I think. There are patients in the bed s around me, silent but for the beeping of their pulses on the monitirs attached to their beds. Did it say coma ward ont eh door, where I ht it? Like brialle, I'm sure I can feekl 'Coma' etched into my palm. It feels numb. I'm sure I can see the curtain(it's blue, despite the emergencyt lighting) waft. The small darejer blue diamonds weaved into its weft, like those into a royal gown, manage not to glitter at all as the curtain moves. There must be a breeze. Not, good, I think. That will let the cold in. I realise I am not cold, nor even cool, but am sweating.

The creature tat has chased us, however, does not move, except it's drip-drip-drip of internal luiquids finding the outside of it, anmd rolling downwsard. I want to move toward her, but she's nmot real, is she? That woul be crazy as a child m who watched a shadow play, crying when the princess was captured in the drk woods by the evil goblins. She wass out of the woods, now. Wasn't that a saying. Didn't that mean she got througn the badf times. Not this timer. A tentacle of shadow passed up from the blue curtain and I know it was this hat was causeding it to ripple, though the curtain is very much of this wortlrds, andf the tentacle isn't. is it? The girl is shaking, the outline of her silhputte going potato like thayt of her piursuer. Tnetentacles reaches her bowed, small, tight head and spears to sniff even thougn ti couldn't possibly have a nose. My cheeks itch and I realise tears are falling on them. I resist the urge to look at the ceiling. It's too dark up there to see, and beside,s I know I am crying. The little girl's sklin goes all the more potato, mash-almost, as the tentacle attaches to her head and begins to suck, gulping her up. Then, it si beyond carohydreaes and she is slurpy it is guzzling down. She screams once, not for long, until her head and throat have been swallowed. What is left of her abdomen isn't one for screaming. When it is done, the tenecale recedes behind the curtain. Just alittle old man, I think, playing us all luike an organ. It isn't.

It is the tin man, recognisable from a hundred viewing even in the half-red light, in my half-black sight. He opens his chesta dn it comes apart without so much as a squiewk, let lone a creak. Inside, as red as the emergency bulbs, was a heart, beating. 'Look what I got,' he said, face poroud as a tin man's could be. 'And me,' the bed to my left. I don't need to turn to hear the sound of somebody scraping back straw. I can only imagine it is from its cranium. 'I got a brain.' 'Yes,' I try to say, to be polite, I surpose, but sob instead.

The lion, or what is left of him. His mane as fallen out, his cranium bald, his eyes big and running as overcooked pies. They look like he is about to crumble. The lines atht saline into his arms seem as big as the limbs themselves. He appears to be trying t smile, to face her as he must be doing cancer, but his teeth cut him, an his eyes cry all the more. I guess they won't stop bleeding for a while. His pillow is matt with thick blood, and I'm sure he has done this before. He whispers something to me. I am too far away. Is he whispering to bring me within bit of his maw, I wondr, but I bend nonetheless. 'You need to go over there,' he is saying. 'You need to go over there.' There are shadows on the wall that are not mine and are not his. They have con'gressing ' I may ot have seen them but they have been watching me.

There ais acrack and a crack appears, red again amidst the black. The red here, unlike thata of the eremegency lighting glistens, wet with a liquid that might eb blood, mioght be cancer. The tumour int eh wall is growing, metat6ising at a rate that would cause an ioncologist to piss themsleevs. It redaches out, the root of atentacle, toward us, and I stumble away, hotichign back onto my right knee, my lkedft out infront of me as though my body has decieded that now whould be a rreat time for what it could manage of thew splits.

With the soundof sucking lumps of vomit back up from anopse, the cancer takes him through the walls, the tumour disappearing, until there is nothing but the crack, inside which is a darkness like that at the heart of black./ The ligts come back on.

He fell to his knees with a crack soenwhre between the metallic of the floor and the bone of his knee caps. Hidden, now, beneath his buttock,s his feet up to his calves were covered in dirt. His arms, eblow the elbows, zooro'd with red lines. If h had not been in a rapier fight, he had taken flight through a dense thicker, and used his arms to protect his eyes. His eyes were red as though he needn;t have bothered. He opened his hands and opened his mout and pressed the former against erh latter. From the utside, it would have seemd that he intended to eat his palms, before moving up to his fingers, but the low, asthmatic sound indicated that he was screaming. His eyelids peeled back his tenmples and forehead, euyes bulging and tearing, as his nose ran first with gunger and the a a thin, diluted line of blood as the scream became something his head could no longer contain and, a the doors fo the lift closed, its sound caqme.

Still, he was sure enough that she shouldn't' just keep saying, 'You have to.' 'Please,' Tony said. Like a straw ina stack of needles, of bunched pain, he had found his tongue. 'Let me lie down. I'm going to be sick.' 'Just a few steps. Go on. Another.' 'Shiiiiiit.' 'That's it. Look would you like some music. I couldn't get spoytify on the laptops, the internet won't load up.

'Yeah, walk with the beat. You're douign really well. That's it. That';s it. One more step.' 'Please.' The song continued. Getting over thre bridge took an eternity, but then she laid him back aginst the linen of the bed. He shivcered out sweat, shaken as water from a dog;'s fur, 'Please,' he continued, though it was over. Tonmy realised he was speaking to his stomach, which felt like it wanted to start something. He managed to pass out before it did. There were times when her absdence ws a rash onb where she would normally hold him, the the forearms above his wrists, his chin, a it pressed intot he ciuirved place at the top of her back, their ankles, where skin met skin beneath their pjama bottoms and above the layered socks. There when her precence was the lights eye-doctors ebam behind the corneas that make you feel as though you are going blind from the inside out. Happiness had never been Tony's spirit level, the bubble settling more easily into despondency. But this, this moving, coulnd't go on, 'Just one more step.' 'You can do it.' 'Come on.' Caught between the rocky place of he pain and the endless soft sea of the drugs, he didn't know if he were coming or going, but was sure that, when she hoisted him up, it felt as if the walking would never stop. 'Fucking hell, man, just get a move on, Christ.' Even here in the endlessness that mnade the end of days seem like they would never end, he didn't eant to diplease her. Pleasing could come or go, but he was southernor, and couldn't be doing with the swearing, or her displeasure. 'One more. Fucking hell,' desperation. ' come on.' So, he went. 'Christ.' Though itw as hard to kniw where his consciousness came into it, where nothing xsimply stoped, at first he thought he was lying side on in an underwater cave. He had drowned, maybe. It would be some tiome before he remembered he was Tony. The light, off white, off in a way that plasdtic could never quite loomk like gold, wavered as though someone were varnishing his eyeballs, and his brain behind them. He tried not to blink. He tried stillness, for awhile. He didn't want tor ock the boat, even if it appeared that the boat was lying at the bottom of an underwater cave, was a wreck. If I'm drowned why is my mouth so dry? It went beyond this; not dry; desert desiccated; not his mouth, only, but his lips and, further, the ridged, flaking fins around them, and the throat the other way. shit. The laquering of his perception was beginning to harden. Amber ridges of sight through which he could see shit the cave was a duvet, no; two, the lips of one closing aroud that of the first, hanging, dog-tonguisly in one place. Shit. It stank in here, and, now he was up and running, at least in his skull, it didn't take Tony l;ong to realise the smellw as him. It wasn't his brain that was swearing but, ina visceral way, his leg. It shot him up with pain. Shot after shit after shot, forcefeeding him, drink this, then salt. Lemon. He blinked breaking his own ruels and moving. Therew as a wall beyond the hole at the end of his duvets. He reached out and blinked again at the fact that this was his hand. His over gronw, rat-tooth nails, dirty fingerprints fo knuckles. There was blood on his right index. Now, he saw that, he noticed his right nostril felt thick, as, he thought, a penis after sex, before pissing. He wonders if he's had a nose-bleed, if he picked it in his sleep, until it ran. He had what he roughly reffered to as narco-picksy. He can't help himself, he thinks.

They're killing people who aren't joining them, Food's running out.' Knock. He hadn't nodded. 'I don't think they like you.' What? He squints at her, his neck stiffening, his head going straight with it, as though she has grasped his chin. Knock. 'What is that?' That wasn't in my head, thought Tony, thinking not of the sound, but of her question. She had heard it. The Knock-knock. 'What is it?' she says. Whos' there? Joanne had turned enough now for Tony to see. On the wall of his room was a silhouetted little girl. With long dark hair draped down in the way of Japanese horror movies. She held up one fists, as much in warning as in knocking. Knock-knock-knock. It fell with a gravelly, intimately boney sound at odds with the concept of a silhouette. Only her knocking seemd to keep her vertical. The wall may as well have been a window. The fist fell and, omn its impact, Tony grasped his eyes. He felt his paloms on the balls as thogh cold rags on coals. Insiead of a knuckle on brick there had been a flash of light. He opened his fingers a smidge, squeezing his sight out from between them. He could see inside the little girl. The silhouette had become an x-ray. Her heart beat, lungs shivered as though upturned trees in a breeze, a white lump that shouldn't be there sat beneath he chin like a swallowed slug. Knock-flash. He squealed. The bursts of white light in hsis ight dwindled, rubbed out by the backs of his hands, and he saw that the slug had grown in her throat. It appeared to be feeding on her. It appeared to be a tumour. The shadow had collapsed to its little kness. It was attempting to etch. No, worng way round, it was trying to breathe. And another sound. At thought, Tony thought had become unmanned and was soiling himself. He wouldn't have blamed his spincter. All the other holes in his body felt as though they were doing the same thing. Joanne had shrunk out of sight, maybe fainted. There was the wheezing ooze of newly birthed poo. But Tony couldn't smell it, and his clenching buttocks couldn't feel it. He ws sfinding it increasingly difficult to breathe. The wet sound was xcoming from below his ears, here, where he was sat, twisted against the bedframe, but not fro a sfar dwon. He grabbed at his throat. It was distended as the little girl's had been, and wet though not bleeding. He too one had away, grasping at it as he had at with his fingers. He couldn't even wheeze. His eyes were bulging as, he kenw from the feel, was tumour on his throat. If he looked down, he could see it peaking, caulish, over his chin. He thought of cigarette packets and passedc out. (and over it all, the clutch of her rib cage like that of an eagle's claw over a small prey.) Tony woke with a gasp. After this, eh went further and wheezed. When he had finished doing so, he sucked, his lips vibrating like a blocked hoover duct. He held his neck, prodding his adam's apple in quick, viperfish movements, as though it might bite him. He stared iout through the acve of his twin duvesta nd knew, straight, that it was linen, and not a cave at all. A shadow fell across what would have been its entrance. Joanne, thought Tony. She held two pills. Blue. Red. Tony tried to gulp but didn't have the saliva to do it. 'Listen, Tony. I'm sorry but I don;'t know how much to give you. These were both in the pain meds area, but I don't think you should take more than one, just in case. So, it's the rde, or th blue, you know, ' she gave a laugh which abruptly hitehedc, like it had come up the wrong way, 'like in the M'' He snatched the blue from her palm ans walloed it, despite his lack of saliva.

'Well, that doesn't say a lot about me, does it?' 'No, it doesn't.' 'Arsehole.' She left. 'Yes,' he says. He had scrabbled at the sheer face of time, and fallen from it. Itw asn't just the drugs, or the way most of the the clock's in this alce had at some point run out of battery, and there arms were now staved in place, like those of formulatdied butterflies. Itw as the night. The end less night. Tony didn't know how long it had taken to ascend the stairwell or remember why, given the condition of his left leg, he had avoided the lift, but here he was, nowi, whenever now may be. Here, before his mother where it had, for him, all begun. 'I'm sorry, mum,' he says, holding his palm to his mouth, after this, as though he nhas burped at the dinner table. She doesn't respond, and isn't ignoring him, as she used yto, when he was atennegar, and used to purposefully do this kind of thing. He regretted being a teenager, these days, more than he had even then (and he'd hated it, wearing asSame Shit Differenmt Day so often he'd had to buy a spare, for the tiemws she stole iyt from his bedroom, and put the origonial in the wash). He felt embrassed. Yes, there was the range of stemches and fluids he had exuded through the years during and chasing puperty, and for some of these she had to taken asiudde, but the embarrsement of being a teenager shamed him, now. Being embarrsesd by adults, by parents, by his mother in particular. Thatw as an issue that stained him still. She ' adults- hahd had thew last laugh, he thought. He qs finally punished and still a failure and after all he had claimed the would be. After claiming he wouln';t end up as them. His mother lies, like Elliot said, like na corpse etherised on the slab. Not dead, but as on the edge fo being wiped out of existenmce as eveubody else in huimanity. Now they had othing but night and, though they had been wiped clean l;ike chalkl froma slate by cloufds for some time now (always that expression, some time, he had no way of telling what the some, was though it seemd to add up to longer than he could stand, and less left than he could stomach). 'I'm sorry,; he repeated, as if she had n't heard him the first time, which she hadn't ans wouldn't no matter if it came a third, or fourth. Or more. He hadn't understood the dimishing retruns of adulthood, or how it would eat at him, at the pith of all he had considered success, as cancer had eaten at her, her brain. In the end, life was the winner, the parasite, and all he had was withered. He held her by the forearm, not the hand, just above the wrist. Her skin was cool, her limb a joint, perhaps lamb. The beep-beep of the heart monitor continued, but could have been the con of the machine, just the sound of it winking at him. Yepm, she's alibve, yep ki, believe it. 'I should have come by earlier,' Tony continued. 'I was just busy. Yeah, I'm still writing. No, I don't know how my book is doing. Guess not so well now. But the new one is looking good.' She hadn't never been interested in this. Perhaps, thought Tony, he sought to push her away from conscioness. Who would want their mother to wake to this. The girl in the bed to his left had been taken. The doctor's girl. He was sensible. He had stopped this going on, thought Tony. The orther, who he would have cponnecetd with the two bald men in the car, if he had anything but self-contrition left about him, was a blot of shadow against the far wall, almost as though he were sinking into it, ioceberg ish, more in the world beyond than this. 'No, I habven't leartnt how to drive yet. L:ook, I'll learn in my own good time. You, know, I live in the city and Joanne doesn't really care about me learning. She likes to drive. I think it gives her indepence. I think'' He is crying and realsises it only because, depszite the wan, skin coloured light not fading, he can no longer properly see. 'You, I keep meaning to say.' He swallowed hard as he had on the blue pill. 'We're getting a divorce.' He shuddered. Somebody was walking over his marriage's grave. 'I'm sorry.' She didn't say anything. She never said anything when she was disappoprinted until, eventually, she would say, 'I don't know, I;m sorry, but I'm just dsiappoinetd in you. Tony.' She didn't say it, not uyet. He swallowed again, threw back the saliva like a shot, pinned down the tremours in his skin. 'I'll ome by again, Mum,' he sauys. 'I won't leave it as long, next time. I promise. I'lls ee you soon. Tae care. Love you lots.' It had been years since he had used 'love'. He din't leave, hwoever. His fingesr won't let go. 'Hold m,e, please, Mum,' he said,. She didn't, and he did leave. His body was arranged around him, moulded from the back outward, in such a way that Tony thought he should be saying 'the bells, the bells' as he dragged his left foot, thump, thump, thump, against the stairs. The heel jarred, the calf jolted but dfelt empty, llike a kicked can. Of course, he thought, I'm going down, so 'the bells' would be a", "label": 1}

He had enough tiem to wonder how people prayede, the matins, tdemans of ita ll, without the sun, when if he was the kind of person to pray he wouldn't eb able to stop, these nights. He had enough time to wonder if he wshould have bbeen religious, before this end, or get religious, before ths shot. It didn't slow him. It wasn't any more than the bone-breaking crack of gunpowder that echoed though the cordiors, and down the warda,s and up the concrete stairwells, anmd not t all, he was willing to bet, in the lifts. But it shot down his wonder, or whatw as left of it. He walked into the corridor to his room, and let the door to the stairwell slap together in the sound of a high five. He walked into his room. The lught was off and it took a while of his eyes adjusting to see that Joanne was staring at him, from the bed bed beside his, a dark smudge of eyes beneath her charcoal cross-hartch of hair, linen gghost white up to her chin. He tried to smile. Like most of the muscles he dragged behind him, it ached. 'Hey,' he said. There was a smell in here. He didn't need to be self aware to know most fo it was him, but theer was a timbre of her. A note, like that in soured wine, of belly-ache, of the potential for poison. She didn't reply. 'I went t see my mother.' All there was was the smell. It seemd to shift slightlu, letting out folds of its pungence, when nothing else in the room moved. He wondered if she had overdosed on the blue, or the red, because she couldn't go on. She loiked like she couldn't go on. This was a different kin d of wonder, he thought. It felt like dread. Then the answer, a mumble, as though words spoken clearly from the bottom of a well that needed to climb up two stones, sink down one, up two, fall one' 'That makes a change.' Her lips hadn't moved. If she were possessed itw s by an unergetic spirit. 'Look,' he didn't know what she should look at. Or why, ana d the imperative dwindled stubbornly in the air. 'You left me alone.' She said. 'I ws asleep and you left me alone in the dark. After all I've done for you.' She was crying. There was nothing in her tone that would suggest it, but a pair of glints in te dark, like tiny mirrors smuggled into her face. Tonyw as a sucker for tears. He walkede to beside her bed, on its left, and knelt, and tried to find her hand, her right, to hold it. She held onto the ghost-white linen, wouldn't let go,a nd so he gripped the outline of her digits, as if he held the businbess end of a cudgel. 'I'm sorry. I didn't think.' 'You never think.' His leg spasmed in this position. 'Hello' it sang at him, like Nirvana. It's the fucking drugs, you idiot. He chewed in his teeth, to stopper what came next, swallowed, regurgiatateed it, but in a softer form. 'I think it's te drugs. Thyve addled me.' He liked 'addled'. His editor had removed it seven times from his last manuscript. She was silent. Thatw as enough. If she'd disagreed, she would have said. There had always been something disargreeable, he wthoguth, about the way she disagreed. Blunt. So says the southernor, her voice chimed in his mind. They had argued over this before; how to argue. He squeezed her hands,a nd did so again, trying to pump hope into it. 'I'll tell you next time. I promise.' How many promises is that, now. She didn't boptehr to say this, and didn't need to. 'Come on. We'll do what you said. Move up to a higher ward. Heat rises, yeah? So it'll be hotter up there, and further asway from those idiots down below.' Her fist stiffened at this, below his palm. Tony ehard the creak of linen stretched to its breaking point. 'Come on,' he oressed gentkly, massaged her to roll over, allowing him in behind her. He staved an arm around her, remnind himself of the move men are supposed to make in cinemas. He cuddled her back into his chest, was careful to rest his right hand and forearm below her breast, but above her belly. In picking which, he would have gone for the breasts. He knew how she stiffened when somebody touched her stocmach. He felt himself stiffening also, but tried to make the motion of pressing his hips aginst hers an act of getting into bed, not a thrust, buta shuffle. Her smell was stringer, now. Neither of them could bear to dis-clothe, to shower, and the odours had accumulated between them as the insults in their marriage. Bitch, whore, arsehole, southern twat, and others, more insidious, you look like our mother when you're cross, you smile like you father, you prat, how do you think I could have sex with someone as fat as you, what are they chicken legs, like chuckinga sausage down a tunnel, more like a chipolata. A moement here, a strech there. She would be aware by now, that he was pressing between her buttocks. Neither said anything; it wa safer not to. She made the shortest of restivenesses, I the ebd, but it pused her aginst him, theerw as a wave of muscles opening up around where he was pressedc into her. He yawned, covered his mouth prettily, allowe the hand, when he placed it back, up, by degrees, to rest on her breast at the areola. He sniffed, and with the sound, made a half shrug, a paten aof accidemt, that brushed her nipples through the layers. She curved, bending like a spoon in the hands of a con man.

I didn't care. A lack of breathing seemed to make hot white bubbles in my skull. My lungs streched toward my throat as thought they could grow fingers and do what my fingers could not, and break his grip. There was a skeletal surety to his thin, artictic fingers, as they throttled me, as though he were dead instead of me. As good as. Each way I twisted or wrenched his wrists, they snapped against mine, and my efforts became more desperate but weaker. I banged my scalp against the side window ' I hadn't realised how far I had sunk intot the upholstery ' and the seat itched at my nape. It was difficult to care. I turned this way and that, seeking an exit where there was none. The blue of the eastern hemisphere passed across my sight blue and deep as water above me, and greying as the sun went down as it would in the sight of a drowning woman. In a series of thrashes, the sunset returned. It was the colour of panic behind my eyes, cut through with dark lines like those clouds. Those lines that were spreading with a sound like his incessant whining. Soon, I would be set, and the night come.

Double whammy. It would be two of many whammies, out there, beyond the solid white line of the dual carriageway. He closed the door and shook his head. [gets out, would later wonder if he would have croseed that line in the road. He wouldn't know because, at that moment, reality crossed the line. The sun disappeared.] Ten seconds before the sun went out, I sat beside him in the car. Tears were still running down my cheeks and I do nothing to divet myself of their itch. Gunge is on my upper lip. Go, I thought, watchi nghim in the corner of my left eye. I stopped doing so, preferring tehn sunset. 'Fucking twat,' I say. He flinches. The sun goes out, and there's not much to describe. It looks quite a lot like this, [page of black] I'm in a coma, Tony thought. No pinch of red, then grey of twilight fading softly to stars. No bee-dimmed glade. A punch of black to the face. The survcors of the crash on the M5 on Bonfire night said 'It was like driving into darkness, suddenly we coudlnt' see anything', he remembered. It's funny what you think of, at times like these, he thought. I'm not in a coma. I can move. I don't want to, but I can. I'm dead. This is the afterlife. I can hear things. It was the screech of tyres but at first, he thought it was screaming. His arms jangled abiove the passenger seat as though ti were an electric chair. The corsa jangled as his luimbs had done, and he realised they weren't on the hard shoulder The wheels made thudded below him, on his side, rtubberised heartbeats at speed, close to cardiac arrest. The screeching was below them. There was a wail of metal, like that of a ship imploding as it went down. Raggedly, dollish for the first time in his estimation, his wife was thrown against him, and he stavened to the dashboard. Gravity had gone arse over tit, and was back, now, to tit over arse. He was pinned to her hip. He jostled in the seat. His bottom seemed to be eating itself, spincter tightening until it his buttocks shrank toward his hips. His back was sure a car would crash into it. He saw nothing. 'I can't see,' Tony screamed, and shied from the high pitch of his voice. 'Shut up,' shouted someone,a nd he realised it was his wife. Voice ragged as her body had been, raw, he could tell, because of what he had dome to her. She had opened the car door. The thudding slowed, though his poulse refuswed to, andf he could feel the car lurching geriactriccly to a stop. The wheels didn;'t sound right. No, not the wheelms the ground under them. It sounded like earth. Tony clutched at his eyes. 'I can't see.' The cvoice- his voice, he recalled- had twisted depepened, as though embarrassed by itself. 'I can't see!' 'I can't f----g see, either,' said Joanne. That shut him up. Hearing, the wailed of a car horn and the sound, like metal plinter in his ear drum, of car hitting car. Ahead, in the blank of his sight, fire light up. There was shatter of glass, somewhere close by, across road. It sounded like the dust of a amalicious fairy. 'Shit,' said Tony. He could hear his on profanity. It sounded especially southern. 'Shit, shit, shit.' 'Stop shouting,'; bellowed his wife, and he did. With a dazed blinking, like the rousing of a warren of rabbit eyes, the street light came on above them, and in a string down the motorway. Seemingly, they lit the apocoaplyse. Tony's heart was reaching for his throat, scratching at his ribs. He saw a hand against a window in a car int eh central reservation. Itw as doing the same as his heart on the glass, and making the same bloddied diacritics he imagined his organ would. The car exploded and Tony jolted in his seat. 'No,' he said.

Pressed tight as they were, there was enougbn between them, bile and shame and sex-with-the-ex, to rapid them downstream, until he came. As he did, there wan another shot. He was aware of her joints cravking to attention, her hand stoppoing in her pants, but he was looding with shame and ectasy and trying to go with the second, until the first inevitably won. It did. She pushed him back,a dn kept pusing. 'Get aeay from me,' she said, her snarl undermined by sobbing. He was still, in part, ejacuilating, but the pain in his lg sent ist own shots to his mind, as he staggered to the floor, and around the bed, and to his own. He fell upon it, and would hgave t roll, later, into the duvets, dude rto the cold, but let it in for now, along with the loathing, not just his, but hers, her silent weeping that he haerrd only in the creaks of her bed frame, the way she punched her pillow. 'Can't you just Turn IT OFF,' SHE SAID. 'I can.' A pausr, in which he doesn't. 'You arsehole,' she says. 'I'm writing.' It sin't far off his other defences. I'm writing. I need time to write. I'm a writer. I'm a published author, you know. 'You know,' she has turned . He herad her bedgframe creak as though straining its neck to lisen. The darkness of her eyes and the glower o her expression beams sideways at him, intensifying. 'Even if you could write a hundred times better than you can, who's going to read it? You'll be no more bloody successful than when all te rest of the writers were still alive.' In the normal run of things, he would have been able to ignore her. Normaility had derailed far from its line, however and was, in the ords of any apocalypse movie trailer, carsh and burned. 'What the fuck is it to do with you? Why can't ypu just ley me live my life an dyou live yours, eh?' It was at time slike these that he reaslied he sounded like a soap opera. This worried him. H eguessed it was the way normal people talked at time sof stress, but he had spent a life-time selling himself the lie that he was different. And he had been buying. She wsns't looking at him anynor,e but the lack of motiojn of his pen between the lines of his novel meant she would know she'd gotten to him. You're a bitch, he wrote, to give the impression of witing, you're a bitch and I wish you'd just fuck off with those stupid, rankenstein browed imbeciles from downstairs. Just fuck, fuck, [the words incrasse toa furios large scribble] FUCK OFF. It wasn't a gunshot but the gun came into the room with all the shock and suddenness of one. It was attached to a glove, at the end ofwhich was a khaki coloured jacket beneath which, Tony knew but could not see as te jacket was farsoned, was a red t-shirt. The carf wrapped around Davey's neck was red and bkacka dn shot throughnw iuthn devils. Tony shrunk like a hibernating flower into hi bed. Raysy carried the sentiment. 'Alright pansy? How's it going hopalong? Leg alright.' In the beside Tony, Joanne was stil. She had learn that, he knew, in her childhood. First nature. In moments like these Tony thought he would have the words, as they did in the movie-scripts. He was a writer, after all. He had one, though, but it was, 'Yug,' at leats, according to his ears,a nd he would have to look up what that meant, in the dictionary. H ehoped itw as something brave. Davey ignored it. 'Look,' he said. 'Don't pay any attention to the gun, it's only a precaustion, right?' Don't think of pink elephants, thought Tony, staring at the barrel. The gun was lowering, going longer in hbis vision, but less holed. Momentarily., he was glad iyt was in Davey's hand and not Raysy's. It semed safer, there. 'Aye, this is just a formality, like,' said Raysy. 'We're hgoing to ask a question, you're going to say yes,a nd we're going to let you into our club, okay writer boy?' Tony nodded. He tried to say ytes. His feet felt like umping up and down on the spot and had to make to with jiggling. 'Oh, sorry, love, diddn't see you there,' said Raysy to Joanne. 'You don't meed to worry about this, all this question business, it's only for the men. Women are, what's the word Davey?' 'I have no fucking idea what you're talking about.' 'It means, like free, like it's ladies night.' 'Gratis?' said Davey. 'Bingo,' said Raysy. Tony swallowed. He thought the gulp could be heardc in the corridor, the stairwell beyond, echoing about the hospital long cold, halls. 'What's the'' he managed. He swallowed. 'Question?' said Raysy. Tony nodded. 'Are you with us?' said Davey. 'Are you in or out?' 'Fancy joing the Red Army.' 'Yes.' It came quick, as he had earlier. 'Good oh,' said Raysy. Tony nboticed he was carrying a black object, not a gun, but as long, wider, a box. Raysys opened it. A cylinder of glass mustered a glint in the wan light, and he saw appoint. A needle, his brtain surmised, joining the dots. 'Welcome to our gang.' Dr Amin knew where the aneasteesologist kept his alchohol.

Too long in the medical world, he had blanmed it, and took the bride his family found not long after. This time he blamed on ending his world. The tatse had made hiom think of the time he had accidentally swallowed a locust as a child in the Swat Valley. His earliest memory, it had made him somehow, he thought as an adult, bitter, inhuman on the inside,a sif the animal had roosted, bred, made him as riddle don the inside as his daughter had been. She wasn't his daughter anymore. To all intents and purposes, he knew, she wasn't a she anymore. 'That's fine,' he said. He placed the bottle on his desk in his officve. The bottom of the bottle rattled as though he has spun it between his wet palms. He wore more than he had on returning to the lift, but at some level he recognised that tgh temperature was dropping and, if he wanted to live free of the flu., or viruses, he should seek the shelter of further clothing. He didn't. He raised the tight, prim, shocked-lipped circle of the bottle to his own. It only totok a few secons to make contact. 'That's fine,' he repeated, as he did when he wanted colleagues to shut up and move on. A modulated voice.You couldn't even hear the shaking. He didn't swig, but stared down the bottle at his daughter. She sat in nthe chair ont the opposite side of the desk, one eye open and another closed. Her chest bended softly tot eh beat of a heart within, as a willow in a slight wind, but she wasn't alove, not in any mearuse of humanity. For some time now she had been less riddled by cancer than by humanity, and, now, the tumour had filled her up like the stuffing in e teddy bear. Even his sojourn beyond the end of the elevator hd been unable to save her,. He glanecde at hisa wrist and tilted it by degrees. His rolex glinted on the little light cast by the lamp in the corner of his office. Wet on his lips. The loamy, slinking, bog-dwelling smell of shame. He didn't open nthem. Staring, he was surprised their were no steech marks on the skin of wrist, pale silver streches like that left by water in dried out gul;lies, or those on the busted guts of mothers. Momentarily, He wished he could be young, again. Again. Dr Amin imagined falling and, involuntaryily, he breathed hard around the bottle end, making a noise like that the air would make when he jumped. Whiskey draped across his shirt and spllated on the carpet wuith a soft thud, but none made his kotuh, E had imagined jiumping for some time. It was his suicidal fantasy of choice. I should drunk, he thinks, it isn't every day your fanastasies come true, or every night. He doesnn'tbut replaces the bottle on the desk, it takes some time to do so. 'That's fine,' he says, to himself, in a a some what harder tone. It isn't every dfay you meet your maker, and it would probably be better to do so sober, all things considered. He gritted his teeth, a sensationtha reminds him of his tone, of his decision, and rises and wlaks around the desk to what had been his daughter. It was comfortin g to think there was something of her left inide, a speck he could see if he gazed into her eyes, but, tonight, the comfort had the same texture as his teeth, and the temperatire of the room, the world. She was fileld, head to toe to the end of her fingers with tumour. King Canday has her, Every single cell, King Candy has her, And on the Big Sea she sails. Where had he heard that, he thinks. Oh yes, Over There. She held, in her right hand with the fin gers that were thick with cancer and unable to unclench, her teddy, Winnie. A fan of Disney, she had named him after her favourite charcter, thoughhe looked nothing like Milne's character, but wass arancid yellow which reminedde Dr Aminfo the whiskey, one missing eye, and a mouth so badly stiched he could have been a wound. It appeared to be winking at him. Dr Amin winked back and lifted his daughter into hsia rms and said, 'Time to die.' She was heavier than he remembered but then beinga girl shaped tumour would do that to you. 'That's fine.' As a doctor he would liem to think he wasn't weeping. As a man, he wwalked tot eh stairwell, his daughter clenched to chest and rose up the steps to the roof.

'Here listen to this,' he says, ''Heads turned down over him, FRankensteneien brows heavy, sharp as the collars of white, ill-fitting shirts.'' Raysy lent foeard, Tony;s book in his weak hand as though he were a player. The description of shirt collar does not fit him. The forehead was too thick. 'Like this mate?' Rayssy says. 'This the metaphor you were on about?' 'It#'s a simile,' says Tony. 'What, like?' 'It's a similie, not a metaphor.' Tony was not in the position to argue, which, as I know from years of marrauge, means he is. He isn't the posiotn to much but lie. They have used beige straps to tie him to the bed, the leather excesses hanging off its frame, dry and loose as tongue from dehyrdaretd dogs. They took them from 'Psych' they said. The Raysy lent and shouted 'Psych' in Tony;s face,. There wss a smell, now, rising from the ha-ha line of blue linen between his legs. Davey hoilds the gun to Tonys heads, at arm's length as though ti is a bomb, instead. Raysy stand straight, using his thumb to worm opne the next page. His other hand hold a needle at the end of which is a tube at the end of which si a pot of ink a sblack as a squid's attack. Tony's book says 'Amy and the Teddy' on it's front, in white on yellow, but the lines raysy is reading do not come from that texrt. H eis reading between the line,s from the book Tony as been writing there , his 'apocoaplyse novel' as jhe keeps calling it. It all seems a bit close to the knuckle, doesn't, now? I thinl. Or abit close ot the forehead. Raysy brings the needle in his hand close to Tony's face,a nd presses a button. The end of the needle begins to judder, like a junkie inneed of a fix. 'By the end of this, pal,' says Raysy, ' you'll be wishing you have a'' he svcans the tecxt in front of him, ''brow as bloody pretty as mine.' 'End of what?' Tony says. It has all the raggedness of amlst breath. Raysy drops the book and with crook of spare fingers, rolling up the sl;eeve of his jacket, and then the twinned layers of his jumpers. Instead of a punch, he prsenets an old tattoo, of a devil, which stands on his forearm. Tony knows then, and stares across at me, eyes desp[erate on my expression. He has bad timing. Just then, I change. Therew asn't much to it. A realisation that, with the ball thrown and spinning on the wheel of fortune, by money is on the wrong number. There isn;'t much to it; the cock of my head toward Davey, the tilting of chin, the smear back of my fringe when Davey's not looking, and the hope, blazing on my eyes, so bright thst I can feel it, even from the inside, that Davey will look at me. Show me favour. I've changed my horse at the last post and Tony sees it. A darkness sinks into his gaze not so much loike some thing inside him as died, a that it is being buried alive. He hates me, now, I think. 'Right, ate,' says Raysys over the teeth-chattering sound of his needle, 'this old devil, ain't going to do itself. Stay still, I would.' The needle goes in and all but Tony's headf moves, his body flailing aginst itself, limbs to ribs, legs togther. 'We need to know you're on our side,' says Davey. It sound as though he's talking himself through this. He hasn't looked at me. I can't move enough to attract his attention. To attract him. 'This is a mark, to show everyone you're on our side. So you don';t get picked on. We need to give you the mark of the Red Army.' ('There? There?' Tony's hisses it up against his teeth. So little of it sieves out it may not have been words at all, but only te drool that is pooling above in the concave dint below his adma's apple.) 'Look,' says Davey. 'Don't worry, we've cleaned the needle. But if it gets infected, just get some antibiotics from the stock cupboard behind the nurses station. You'll be fine. Fine.' He would have curled up into a ball if he wasn't held straight by the straps. As a child he used to rock, ehad-dwon, on the carpet, knees drawns beneath his chins as though oscillating himself out of existence. As a child he had run away from home, though the run had slowed to jog and the n a crouch, and away had been as far as the all around the corner from their front door. His parents hadn;'t been taken in by the pretence. At the time of leaving, he had. 'Get them off,' he shouted at her. 'Why don't you make yourself fucking useful and stop making fucking doe eyes and get these the fuck off.' She was a wavering mess in the corner of his right field of vision. If he hadn't been crying he would have been able to tell that she was wweeping. He felt the tug at his wrist of her doing a she had screamed, but his head was too busy jerking forward, chin chicken-beaking out, teeth clench into a line as tight zas any beak, to notice anything but the agony on the outside of hiss kull and within it. She untied his left hand side and his fist came away, unable to uncurl. He stood in a hiss like a gas escape. He felt ready to go. To run. To spark. 'Look,' shewas saying, but he could barely see enough to find the door and was no where neafr able to listen. He passed through it and turend toward the stairwell. H eas out of here. 'Stop.

He wioed at his forehead in short, flyctchig nactions. He daren't touch where the needle had gone in. His felt like he had walked into a cobweb made of acid. 'WAHAY HERE HE IS WAHAY.' The sound was a slap. catcalls a scratch. Tony stumbled back aginst his injured calf. It gave beneath him with a sucking moist marshy sound, as though drawing him. Gammy, he thought. He flailed at the air. Somehow grasped balance. 'HE'S A RED A RED A RED TILL HE'S DEAD HE'S A RED.' 'Leave me alone. Leave me'' Tony screamed, his voice fracturing, not so much breaking as the esentence went along as broken before it began. 'Don't be like that matey.' 'Don't leave us pal.' Laughter. 'Hey, say excuse me. I was here first.' 'He's gone red in te face.' Laughter, some of it female. This was ahrper, like the teeth of vampires. 'What's that on your head, Tony Stones The Writer?' 'It's a Frankenstenien brow.' Laughter. 'Who's the Frankensteion, now, Tony Stones The Writer.' Tony was almost at the door, now. He see it's outline, a mirror before a world that had been turnd off. A m oster leered up in the glass, flailing and manglned beyond recognition, or nearly. He realised it wss him. Darkness atenneded the image of him, swiling about it. As he closed on the door, he saw it was crowd, jeering, cheering his exit. He walked into the door. Laughyter. The female cut throught he amle, incluing him. He remembered secondary school. The door was automatic but had not opened. 'Don't go, #oh please don;'t go,' someone sang, their voice high and popular. 'Don't leave us alone, Tony Stones.' A waith ion the corner of the mirro that was the hospital's front doors, he saw his wife, hanging back, wavering in and ou of visibility. He twisted his body more so than it ad been already, sideays like a broken straw, and swernched at the door, his fingers and their unclipped nails finding purchased between the lips, of cblack plastic. With a mddeneing grind like teeth on a bacjkboard and pop of cold air, the doors came open and he slid through. They closed as he went, on his trailing leg. With a harpiyish scream he wrench and barked it against the glass, crowbarring out hi limb. He was out, crawling up onbto a low hill, of snow he had not expected to be there so close to the doors. The crowd beyond the glass doors laughed him out, audible even through the panes. The skin blazing red with humiliation on his nape forcved himforard out into the night, like the millennium Falcomn from an exploding death star. He pretended to look uo. To care about the sky, to distract them, all of thos bastartds, from knowing they had not only gotten to him, but gottn inside him. The sky was dark and falling. Momemtarily, Tony realised it wass not the sky and not even a body, bu two, a man and a girl, beffoe he threw himself, back, against the hospital's doors. Pain screamed through his spine (I guess that's why it's called a window pane, a voice said in his mind, iobliquely, and it wouldmnbe some time before he recalekld he had though of Enienbem) and he bouneced forward. The bodies hit, the arm of one stretched out as though attempting to make a snow angel with its fakll. Tne wrist of iut caught his forhead. The tattoo on which exploede into agaony. (A devil of a thing.) and poped 3with wetness as blood deltaed from his eyebrows an around his nose and the clenching workings of his cheeks. He fell to his knees nd,s taring, saw a glint of what had grazed him. A watch, In what would have been gold in any other light, iut read 'Rolex'. Rolex Nicks Man, he thought in Sun-Headline font, andbegan t sob. Sioemtiems he wished his mind would just stop. Give up and go home. He had done that before, when he was eight. 'There's a girl theer,' a man's shout. The scrape of the door opening. Mne gathering, takin charge. 'Get her, bring her upm get her inside.' And woman, commentarting, as though on a race. 'he jumped with her. Poor miote. He landed on her.' And. 'she's aline. She's got a pulse. Get her into a and e.' The man with then rolex was left as tony was, for dead.

{"text": "didn't know how long the walls would remain vertical, or him, for that matter. He had reached the lift, the eletrcity og which made a purring sound, like that of cat. He looked down. It wasn't the cat- it lookled far to grumpy. Tony collapsed against his heand,. Which was attached to the up./down arrows, which was attached to wiring that made the light door open. The world was spaghetti being eaten in Lady and the Tramp. One thing leading to another. Tony felt mushy on the isnee, but more his brain than his heart. He stumbled in. The cat was already here, somehow, or its twin was, sitting in the corner leafing through a booklet made of yellow, liend paper, on which was crawled [a picture of imaginery./complex formaula] 'Look.' That wssn't the cat. The doors closed. There wss somebody else in here with him. 'I'm sorry but'' 'Get away,' he said, and vomited,bent until he could no more without flling. As he doubled, his hand found the control panel. As he vomited the lights went out, the rde lights went on, Tony's hand pressed ' 1 and the lift oplumtted. The lnowledge that he had become weightless came as both the vomit and it's stench rose. His shins felt wet as it lapped there. The room had already been spinning, his perception a listless tilt as though his brain weer caught in mid shrug, and nio longer wished to be particularly attacehed to reality. The soles of his shoes were not attached to the lift-floor. There was a rustle as the pages of the book the cat had pinned open lifted and flapped, closing some, opening others. The cat itself did not appear to enjoy having its study interrupted, not, at leats, by the expression on its features. Therew as asound like wind passinga round the lift, whistling through its nches, until Tony noticed that it was louder, and came from his wife's screaming mouth. Other odours joined that of his vomit, dull sweat, a dale around the sharp crags of puke, the smell from his crotch that was one part wee, one sweat, and the other frfom the intimacy with he had shared with the woman who bobbed on the ceiling, her scream curling at its edegs, then ripping slowly inward, toward the centre of her full-stop mouth. Her lips rippled with the rip, her eyes widened as her mouth tightened,a dn Tony thought he could see a question within the hard, chocolaty exterior of fear. Why haven't we hit the bottom? If anything, this seemd to undermine her terror. Tio tear the floor right from under it. They hit. (arvand sphere nineteenth century lift level indicator?) Buzzzzzzzzzzz. The electrical iompulse of neurones getting together over this moment, fusing, agreing. Buzzzz. It wasn't what it was supposed to be. He wasn't dead. Buzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. There should have been more of a to-do about he opening of his eyes. A dignitary, the cutting of a ribbon, a plaque, perhaps. The Buzz, he sees, is a fly, attracted, by the fell of its scampering, excited motions, by his head, where the needle had been. His forehead throbs and feel as if it might detach itself from the rest of his head, and make off with the fly, flying toward the hole in the ceiling. He might have qwonedered how the fly got, if he hadn't seen then hole in the ceiling, which was the kind of brown that made one think of holes in the ground, and had a rope pendulining from it. At the end of which, if Tony followed the parabola that was going ever more vertical, was tied a bottle contining liquid the colour of a shadows under trees at twilight. Tony could not help but think of the hum of bees, despite the fly. The bottle and the rope, given the narrowing parameters of its swings, must have recently fallen, not unlike him, thought Tony. With a croak from mouth his throat and his spine behind it, he turned his head, and saw Joanne who lay as he did, but as of a moment before, staring upward with a slack expression which said less deceased, more astonished. Tony looked to see what she saw, in case he had imagined the scene on first glimpse. He hadn't. He ha,d however, missed something, a lage note through the hole-punch of which a lilac length of strung tied it to the bottle. The noe said, clear even through the haze of the fly (which had now left his forehead and scampered to his eyebrow), 'This Will Take You Back' in calligraphy that would have made the sixteenth century proud. Joanne rose into his field of vision. How can she do that? he thought, It seemd an act as at odds as the lift's plummet through the earth's substrate, as vomit floating up his shins. He saw more flies and jojned th dot of them, turning his neck back to sideways. He saw, also, where they had coe from, most latterly. The body of a rabbit lay, its neck apparently broken by the impact that had failed even to bruis ehinm, or stop Joanne from satnding. The cat, ingnoring the insects, was taking out its spleen. Having done this, it batted it across the lifts floor, now longer shiny, but now crumbed with dirt, and smeared with rabbit blood, and splatterd by where the vomit finally found its rest. Which was everywhere, it appeared. He felt suick and realised some was on his hand. He put his other palm to his mouyth and bit the skin, hoping their was no puke there. He didn't taste any and thanked stars. It was beyond him to believe that he had any lucky ones. 'It smells of Christmas. My mum's perfume,' said his wife. Tony stared past the fingers splayed across his eyes. She had unstoppered the bottle and sniffed again. 'No,' she said. 'My dad's farts.' She recoiled, herself pressing her own", "label": 1}
{"text": "hand to her face, but beyond it, she was smiling, as if fiondly, sas if at a puppy. 'Put it ack in,' YTony rasped. She either didn't hear him, or ignored. He sus[pected the latter. She looked up the rope. :I could climb that,' she said. I think I can see'' His senses, his thoughts were coming together and kept coming, sharpening. 'What?' eh said. 'You wouldn't believe me,' she said, re-stoppetring the bottle. 'What. Dancing girls? Chocolate? A nivce big bottle of fifteen year old Lahphroig? Wht do you see?' 'Daylight.' The word fell from her lips, out of place, laughter at a funereal. Tony snorts. She didn't lookm down but placed one hand on the rope and one hand above it and hoisted herself over the glass bottle. 'Stop,' he said, rising to until hisn toso was upright. It felt numb., plastic, a dummy. His head was worse. 'Stop.' She ws nearing the top. She went into the hole. She didsappeared into darkness. There was no light up there, though it loked like a tunnel. Dirt time-glassed to the light's floor. After a mimute of thism her feet reappered and she lowered herself to her hiops, hanging from the centre of the lift's ceiliung, from the hole. She let go, he saw, a moment after she had, as she hit the floor, rlling tot eh side as she landed. She came to a rest in the rabbit's corpse. There was a scquek, as though it had wind in it still, and s creech from her and a hiss from the cat, who was not amused. Probably, thought Tony. 'You alright?' he asked. Sometiems it was hard to ignore the noceties. He was too mdlle clas, she always said. 'Yeah. Yuck.' She got up and bfrushe dher jumper off, wiping claw marks of blood across her abdomen. 'It's hot up there,' she added,a nd took off the top layer of her jumper, then the next, elaving only two t-shirts. NMow, Topny could tell how much she was sweating.She was right, whoever. It wasn't down to her exreryiokn s, alone. It was hot in here. A fact that hadc not been true for anywhere in Tony's existence for two weelkls, at elast. He wondered how he hadmn;t noticedm, then recalled the shoit leg, the tattoeed forehead, the plummet in the lift. He could give himself a break, he reckoned. Everyone lse had been trying to, it seemd. He ros ro stand next to her. The comparison, side by side, was disconcerting. The leg-injury had made him a good inch shorter, and the tattoo a bad posture even worse. He was diminished. 'I'm going to rink this,' she said. 'I think you have to, to get through the tunnel up theer.' 'You don't know what's in it. It's nto worth the risk,' Tony said. 'It si. I saw daylight up there, at the end of the tunnel. You know,' she turned to look at him. 'I think we're underneath a rabbit hole.' She seemd to be studying his face. I should be doing that to you, thought Tony. 'I saw a nature program. Can't remembegr what it's called. They built these warrens with a glass wall, and you could see every chamber. There's rabbit poo up there, look, look''' she pointed down herself. @i'cve still got some on my knee.' Tony looked. She spoke again, and his eyes went up to her lips. 'Buut I can't get up throught eh main entrance.' 'Why don't we,' byu this, he meant 'you', 'we don;'t we just dig through.' 'Yeah,' she nodded, but the motion got sidetracked by her thoughts and became a shake, 'no, it's hear for a reason' and she reached to the bottle, unstoppered it, and had it at her lips before Tony could say. 'Don't.' So he didn't. It jhadn';t been long since he wished her dead. The cat hd taken to the rabbit's heart, squeezing out what it had left t offer. She drank half and let the bottle go. It swung by its stem. Sje droped the stopper and it clattedee on the floor. It didn't distract the cat, which continued to play even as a dry sound came from Joanne's skin, lie that of leaves curling on an autumnbral floor. Her hair rose, her height fell. Tony no longer felt dimished. She had a brown bob and about three feet six inches, from the soles fo her feet to the bob's top. Her double d breast, even beyond the t-shirts, had been swallowed by the lips of her rib cage. Her face was angular, her liumbs a greyish brown and fragile, twiggish. She wore clown shoes that had been boots an momembt before, a nd trousers that wrinkled up like sloughed off skin. 'What are you, like eight?' Tony said, not noticing either that jer had done, so or after he had. She didn't reply but liofted her hands and stared at them when, Tony thought, she should be looking at her lack of tits. The Yorkshire cat looked uop btu didn't; seem to find anything of this particularly surprising and looekmd down at the rabbit once more, abd at what now appeared to be lungs. 'This takes you back,' whispered on,. He wanted to go back, to a time before all fo the mistakes he had made. To a time before Joanne. He reached out and drank, and shrank, as she had. The shrinking was nto painful but unsetllign,t eh physical equivalent of beinh inside one of the funny, bendy mirros at a circus, being the reflecetion more tha n the original. From the inside the sound was not that of desicatting leaves, but of wind across a plain, as singing is always better onm the inside. But, his leg was till there, when it had finished, and his jenas were several sizes too biug, it was til there, behind him. He raised a small hand with smaller fingers to his forehead, and they came away", "label": 1}

'I used to be blonde. Am I blonde?' H efelt he needede ot be. Ritehr seing this, or reporting fact, she nodded,a nd tunrd and grasped the rope and pulled hers elf upward. This seemed easier but, as he had been changing, she must hve shed all but her t shirt and moved ina way that suggested that she was no longer weighed by her life as an adult. He tried not to glance up between the gape of her clothing, athtne did, and wondered what this made him. Not excited. By the feel of it, he had little to be excited with. He took off his jeans and baggy socks and boxers,a nd jumpers, and buy the time he scaled the rope, usin hios good leg and two skinny arms, she was out of sight, wriggling up through the trabbit hole, visble only as cork to the light he saw, inglimpses,seepining in. Bright eyes glared at him from the lambent, uterine burrows to his sides, Tony's skin goosebumping as would a turkey's on the table. He couln't stop thinking about their teeth. They ' the eyes and the canine ' put him in mind of Watership Down, not of ', or ', or', but of the bad rabbits driven mad by roads and death and humans. THOUGH BURROWED WIDE BY his wife ' she can't be, she's too young to marry ' the tunnels contrict him, his chest, tight as lung's '. In an asthma attack. And there is s a stench in here, foetid, fecund, rank, and high, not of something that has crawled down here to die, but that couldn't, too overgrown to fit, and was wedged above, rotting down. He crawled toward this, but didn't. To the lLight. Sunlight. An aurora of it around Joanne. This drew him up, fish on its hook. The glint as of around a coin in ahoard. Golden. He would crawl into Hell to feel such heat, see such light. And up, slither up, up, wriggling. Gritted teeth, dirt fallig between them, sieving onto his tongue, the taste of honest effort, dirt making an archeological mureal of his tattoo. He blinked it from his eyes, throwing off the soil as he hadn't the fly. Joanne was gone, now, from his narrow, shocked 'o' if vision. There was Only sunshie wan and grey to his sight, but bright. He emerged into shadows cast by heaped ribcages of savanna grass, high as the bones fo a Brontesauroes, thick and bristling. He emerged into shade not direct sunlight but that was enough for Tony's eyes, and they began to cry. Nearby, he could hear his wife was similarly occupied. He walks to her and her and the sobbing hole in her face around which she was falliung apart. It was at tim3s like this, as h3e walked, that he knew he wasn't a sociopath,. Despite what she might say. The humidity made the walking like wading through heatedf mushy peas. His years up north had taught him that much, at least. It took several ehaves for her to realx against him, for her head to tilt to his shoulder as he smoothed her hair, working against the simplm,e brown bob as though ringing out the tears. With or without the weeping, they would have been wet. The temperatire suporated their pores and, sweat rising to the skin as moisture did from all around, drifting in dragon breaths from the curved heights of the svana grass. Tony wiped an arm along his forehead dn succeeded only in slickening it. He didn't drown any hairs he had tehron. He didn;'t have any hairs. It was ngoing to be hard to get used to his size. He kept running a tongue across teeth he knew would be baby, and thinking they felt as big as an adult's, before realiszing his tongue would hav shrunk with the rest of him. His t-shirt pooled around his lap like ' [flowers] about Ophelia. The sweating increasede. He felt he wass drowning in the air. Somehow, he missed te cold, Then, of course, knew he didn't. Joanne had stopped crying and was distancing herself with the staving of her spine, the striaghteing of her neck, taking her head from his shpulders, with a low moan of surprised terror. Tony turned to loom at her face, and twisted to stare along with hr eyes at the ant that entered the bowl of vegetagion. If they had shrunk, the ant had grown, and then some, becoming bigger than him,. Its head boobed in ther air as if sniffing and was th size and colour and opaqness of a basket ball. It's eyes were oblique and black as a shark's. It ddin't seem to have nay issues with standing, still, however, and sniffed toard Joanne and Tony, its' antenna whisking the air which semedd to congeal around it's head like a hllainaise. It's legs and body werew vaugule translucent in the way of sweets, thougnb these sweats were huge, and would have graced Willie; Wonmka's factory, Tony coulnd't help but think. It's going to kill us, he couldn't help but add. As Joanne had pullerfd back form him, he pushed her away. She fell compliantly, open legged, and supine ohe ground, her eyes the only part of her that was still on the move. Tony rose, his bad leg music-staved behind her, giving him the image of a karate-stance, and none of its stability. The ant lowered it's head. It's the [incer clackded togther infront of its maw, as though saracsticall clapping. Agony ant, thought Tony. He found it impossible, then, not to bgrin, and, directly after to giggle. The ant appeared to take against this, and rushed at him, in a csattrer of six limbs across compacted dirt, it';s head rising", "label": 1}
{"text": "as would abulls in any hemingway novel. Tony was thrown off his feet, and launched bck into the saber-curve of a a length of grass. Bouncing off it, he thought, they're as strong as they're suppooed to be, and crumpled to the earth. As Joanne moaned so did Tony, tasting soil. He cpughed to distract the ant as it capered toward his ex wife. Fluids were pulsing in its body, he saw, as he saw it in profile. Guts and heart were visible. Lungs? What was the term for an insect expert. He wasn't one, and didn't know. He push-upped hiosmefl vertical. 'Come on,' he whispered. He had meant to shout ' to distract the insect- but a whisper was the most his lungs would do. The any came anyway. As it closed Rony clapped to his left and dicved right, his hands holidng any imagimary red rag. Perhaps reacting to the sound, the ant went away from him and charged out from under the grsass and into the sunlight of the glade beyond. 'Run,' he said, to Joanne, before realising that his mouth had givcen up on even whsiopering. Joanne had stoo,d anyway, as though he were as psyhich as ant's were supposed to be, btu stood rooted to the soil. The ant was staggering as though Tony ahd jumped on his back. Instead of him, he could see, despite the glare of the sun across its abdomen causing sun spots across his vision, was a reedd lump. No, two lumps, three, like a granny ordering tea. Then more. Whereas before, its torso had throbbed translucently with the display of inetranl oirgans, now it was blubbering ' its skin broiling- with red, glistening lumps, like instanrt-cancxer gone crazy. That's some sunlight, thought Tony, and staggred hismefl, both metally, and with his feet. The ant had collapsed, now, as much into itself as to iuts chin and from its legs. Every thingw as a mulch, its form no longer even a body but a writhing mass of meta'.'s, jokeyting for positon, as though supping on its ine=sect flesh wasn a race, and to the victor the spoilt meat. Finally, hissing slightly, it was unrecognisiable from what iut ahd been, and Tony turned away, making the same noise as the ant's corpse with his lips. He bent and retched and nothing came forward. Who was he kidding? What would shock him now? 'What was that?' said Joanne. Tonmy lookd up past his eyebrows at her. She was standing. He thoguth of repeatin his joke, Agony ant. But, if anything, itw asn't an ant anymore. He shook his head as though to dislodge it ofnthe thought and then heard it, a call, likie that of a bugle floddoded with saliva. In his sight, Joanne tensed. Itew asn't the first that had happened. She looked vulberable, as a little girl, her limbs twigs that could be stood on. They stood still;, tony and Joanne, trying not to make a sound. There eas the noise, somewhere out int This Plac,e of foliage disturbed, feet onm the run. The horn sounded again, a hunt where the hunts man could not stop drooling. A child ran past, slightly shorter than Joanne, and the height of Tony. It's skin was a tek brown and shining with xsweat as though the wood had been varnished. It5s legs were a fairy blur. It, then, was gone. 'WTF,;' adsi Joanne, theabbreviation taking longert than the child to pass. There was something following it. The horn, again. 'Run.' This tim, it came out. As did, 'It's rambunsctious obvuious, in;t it master squires.' And, 'How oft must I's says 'Captin's. Captin's!' Followed bu, 'it's rambunctious obvious, in't masyter squires?' 'Captin's! Caoptin's!' 'It;'a rambunctious obvious, in't master s. I's is the Captin. I's the Captin!' Two voices, Tony could tell, befor either rounded the cross hatching's of grasss. But two voice of the dame dialect, the same slick accent, the identical burbling pronunciation,a s though fo trhe same, salivic throat. 'Gimme the horn, moron.' 'My name's ain't Ron, just as your name's ain't Pretty.' 'Pass yer arse around a whipple stick you puss-filled slapstick.' 'Slaptick my anal place!' The sound of a slap. A slap in reply. Slap, slap, slap. The sound and it's orgin round a frond of grass. They were close the two speakers. Joined at the hip wasn't half of it, but fixed, as well, by the throat and the scalp, and even, at the corners by the lips. They sahred one eye, with one of each of their which stared round the corner fo their joined face, and could have entered a three lkegged race without the aid of any string. The eye in the centre droopped, ;azy or simply exhausted. Everythign ws steched, moreover, as thought eh two forms were attempting to pull away from each other, at the same tiome as engaging in slapping the other's face. Then hands hung in mid blow, and in the thick air. 'It's a child. It's.' said one, the saliva of its ,mouth running into the other's, as tide between estauries. 'Tis. Likely a great prize, one think.' 'I think too.' 'So ye says, Seen no portenbts of it.' They were dressed ' ofr it was dressed 0- in livery of the number '2' in red on black, and sporting insigias of what seemd to be red cabbages, or florets, shapes that had the lookm of the ant in the hot, overhead sun. 'Split up,' shouted Tony. Joanne ran one eway. Tony ran the other. Behind him, he hearf the things say, 'Can't do.' 'Tried it.' 'Bled excessivle and fell aspleep in our own sick.' 'Bereaking uo just won;'t stick.' Before, mo9mentarilyy.' ASfetr him!' And 'after her!' And a crssh, some of iut from their armour, of the things trying to run in oppsotite direction s, and falling over.

{"text": "me at every turn. As I run, arms out and hands flat and tilting like the flaps on an aerop;lnaes wing, it throws up roots to trip me. In ths ahdowed, dried-out gullies the corpses of brooks are thin mud traps. The earth seems to have crawled in to the darker spots under the tall grass and hunkers there, unsen, and ready to stub my toes, take me off my feet. But none of these compare with the sunlight. The memory of the giant ant bubbles up in my mind as its skin did in the open. Here and theer are triangle of sunlight, lazoringh down from the canopy above. Nothing lives I n these. Even the dirt looks like it wants to move out. As tith infrared tripwies,I don't dare to cross into the light. Somewhere behind are the pureurs. Two or one, itw ass hard to tell. The bugle sound, mucusy as a flooding lung, and I pass into a cooler, deeper dark beneath what is no loinger savanna grassa dn are high, thicket choked trees. I ave always run as a footballer should not play, head down, eyes just before my feet. Now, I stop before I fall, and only slip on an ochre, toxic-hued puddle of fallen, rotting seeds. They are bright orange and have the loomk of bitter pills, each, or sweeitie sin foreign airports from years ago, when my mother would say, 'no, they'll rot your teeth'. These just rotted into themselves. If I were to guess, I would would say Laburnum, but I'm not a dendrologist, and there is something Otherwordlyt about the trees in here. I look up. The canopy is a sharp rockface of silhouette, beyond which the sky is pure white, a flash, the wink of an atom bomb. Here and there, the sun gets through,. Inone such place, a corpse decomposes. It maqy have been a rabbit. It was twice the size and more than half-tumour. I have stopped running, I realise. This wood is silent. No bird calls, which deosn't surprise me, given what happens up there, in the sky. The sound of my breathing is heavya dn nto falling behind me. I start, again, but not for more than a stride. A figure peels off the bark of a nearbvy tree, silent as peeling a banana, its skin tanned as wood. It is dressed in nothing. It's a boy. Adding to his camouflage, he carries a branch, a crude weapon that has been sharpened to such an extent, the tip of it pierces my imagination. I can't help but think of it skewering, a splinter thatw ouldn't come out easily, at elas not with on e of my organs. I gulp. Further down, my body shivers as the point of the wooden spear clses on my stomach. My heaert strikes midnight. My abdomen is flatter down there than it has been for a long time; I long, momenmntarily for the fat. Anything t put between m,y entrails and this boy weapon. He has a look in his eyes that says he's seen enough of death to feel comfortable shaking hands with my blood. His eyes are darker than the wood. Slowly, he raises a finger to his lips. I gulp agin, this tiome in hope. Svage as his hair looks, the way his penis does not seem to care that it just hangs there, his shushing quietns the beat-beat in my ribs. He is shorter than me by the height of his hair, which seems to be about a foot. He look beyond me. Sniffs as though listening with his nostrils, and then splays fingers out aroudnn the shusing fingers and beckons with the whole of his hand. Follow, he seems to say. I try, but my legs have taken this moment to join in with my lungs and choke. He closes, leans in, drawing a semi circle on the flat of my belly with the spear he cariies. I expect him to be close enough to kiss, then lunge, skewer me, but instead, he whispers, 'Listen, I klnow you're not used to This Place, but it really is not the best of ideas to simply stand here. If the two of tumours takes you, you'll end up at the table of thw Candy Kinbg, and not as one of his esteemed guests, if you know what I mean.' I have watched Made in Chelsea, and his voice reminds me of the children, there. Not so much as if he speaks around a plum, as around a punnet. 'O'K'' I mouth, as little of it escaes onto the congeale air of the wood. 'Right O,' he says, and gently takes my hand and forcibly tugs it and I follow. Joanne was gone, as an uncoordinated rush of running trough the burush. Tony had always found it funny, the way she ran, head tilted forward as thiugh to long a stride might jolt it off, long legs loping as if the world were made of ste;pping stonmes, arms outstretched, palms upward, weighing, perheaps, if any normal person would run this way. Itw assn't funny, she had told him. Why do you always make me gfeel bad about how I look? She had asked. It wasn't funny. The creatue turned their sharedca nd individual eyes on him and Tony ran. But his lame leg was his own Siamese twin (his nicked forehead a nigglinglittle sister, the tattoo an embarssing parent he couldn't shake at the school gates) and he stumbled into a tree. 'Har, har,' said oe of the mouths. 'hee, hee,' agreed the other. Tony was beyond the bough., now, but moving slowly. 'Coem on, conmeon, come on, ' Tony's breath was hot and fast, outdistancing him. 'Let's get him,' the two mouth cried, as one, particularly where they met. The creature coud be heard pounding across the ground, a bad rhythm, a vibe gone awry. A drummer having a seizure. Tony wheezed under trhe long grass, avoiding", "label": 1}
{"text": "the whip-lines whereh the sunlight fell through. The creature was at the tree, behind him. 'This way,' itg said. 'No, this way.' It hit the trunk. Tony heard the crack, followed by a sandy thud. He guessed the creature had fallen backwards. A scramble,as it rose. Tony stumbled down the lee if a sandbank, around ahole in it bluff the size of a shield. He crouched under it lip. Momentarily, the creature approached, mumbling to itself like an unanswered ringtone. 'Always go right. When you have a choice always go right. Everybody knows that.' 'What's wrong with left.' 'It's just not right, is it?' 'Which way you reckons he went?' 'Blwo the horn, fellow.' 'Nab. The kIng wikll be rancid with anger if we send this here hunt the wrong way. Dripping.' 'Nice, pretty little red fox, though ain;t he, right up to the top.' The slapping sound of lips being licked. 'Yep, yep, indeed, the King will just lick him up, lap him down. Yey.' 'Hey, stop licking my lips, you noisome, foulmost beast.' The slapping became that of palms. Theyw er above Tony. He could smell the cfreatures. Merdicianl as a lepers swimming pool. Chrloine on dioseased skin. And, when they laughed or cried out, the end of a whiff of rott. Slimy, thought Ton, before realisng the slime ws on hs own back. 'Bloody stones,' said a voice behind him. Tony jumped out of the hole. 'Oh, I'm sorry,' said a worm as the a\\nt's body in the direct sun. 'Thought you wrre a stone. They soemtiems faqll intot eh end of my holes.' Tony grappled frantically at his back. His fingers came away slicked, wet, smelling of mactated dirt. His cheeks must have been spanked back in shock, his lips following them in aconvoy of disgust, becauser the worm added, 'No need to lok like that. I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned.' 'What?' hissed Tony. Coming out in the high-pitch of an eight year old, he sounded embittedec beyond his years. 'WHAT?' 'Got you,' said the creature above him. 'What he said,' said its twin, pointing ;lattereally. Tony rab, lunging forward as much to evade his own back than anything that followed him. 'How rude.' The worm could be heard to mutter, 'Huamns today! No manners!' 'Shut it, now, you worm,' said one of the worms. The other seemd to breathe for them both, as it broke open its gait, an dstridedd into arun. 'Yes? And? Is that supposed to be an insult?' The worm's reply faded to a rumble, then into the distance, as Tony ran from the savanna grass ansd into a fo aforest thatw a ddark and depp, already, eher at its edge. He kept going intot he dark, driven on by his relenetkless heart. 'Oh, look how he runs.' The creature shouted, 'Fast as a wet fart.' 'Can't see him. Too dark.' Itw as and it wasn't. In places, flashing kaleidoscope before his reeling eyes, Tony saw shapes where the sunlight had macheted throuyght the dense canopy above. Bright diamons, coal-faggot quadterlatals, and all sort of triangles; sizzling isocles that put Tony in mind of sausages on the barbecue, sharp-edged scalenes. Falring his lungs breathed so fast one breath met the other on its way in. He stumbled, btu avoided all of the places thatw ere lit. Ran straight into the dark. A dark so pitch, he quickly became unsure if he had ot had not closed his eyes,a nd reache up to check the eyelids. So dark, momentarily, he couldn't find them. By luck and occasional, shin barking judgement, he ran between and qartound trees until the voices of the creature ws left far behind. Then, abruptly, he ran into nothing. Normally, he liked running into nothing. Unlike something, it didn't bloody the nose. Now, he had the sense of falling, the feeling there wasn nothing beneathn his feet, and he hit the ground below befor even his brain had said, There's no ground. A wet heat slugged into his left eye. He reached up. In the dark he felt blood. He had felt enpugh of his own, recently, to recognise it as such. From his temple he felt, also, what seemd to be horn. Long and shorn from wood. He was stood straight, propped between a series of wooden spikes. Nicked again,he thought, bitter as the blood that was now reaching lips fatter than he remembered them being. Having little choice but to be sttod up, eh passed out, falling into unconsoipus. Light. Dark. Light. Tony winced and his forehead regtretted it. He shouldn't have been used to these changes in the lighting. By now, after all. Dark. 'Limp' Fatherfucking' dick,' said a voice from above. It's tonme was broken until it seemed coiled into its self, but high, and somehow feminine, ansd somewhat pink. Light. Tony tried to shy away from it, but was pinned, as much as a stavened butterfly. He felt morfe like a moth, even though the light was doing nothing for him. He rose his hand, sieved the rays between his fingers, stared. Above, head shrouded in an antihalo of dark, was what seemd to be alittle old lady, bowed and shrunken at the lip of the hole into which he had fallen. The little old lady worked at the torch in her hand. 'Stupid, little pirkc.' The liught held. 'Where am I?' asked Tony. The question b;lurted out like a frog's ribbit ' in a croak. 'By the witch'' said the old lady, by way of reply. Momentarily, Tony realised she wasn't replying. '' you're a human.' The was adry, snake-like rustle and a length of rope fell into the hole, flapping against Tony's head. 'Here.' Tony grasped at it. Tne rope prickled his palm. 'Can't pull myself upm' mumbled Tony to himse;f, without even trying to do so, into the darkness of the pit. It seemed to sut his self-pity. 'I can pull you up,' she said. 'You're too small,' Tony said to", "label": 1}

He heardf screaming, growing as though from below them, and then shooting upward in pitch like one of those annoiying binfire night rockets the show of neighbours liked. The barrier nor the grass was stopping the lorry. It didn't so much plough as trench the ground between the Volvo and the motorway lights. In the dark to their right, closer than it had any right to be, was the desperate turning iover of an engie. He thoguth he saw asilhoutte. Lorry lights keeled over the edge of t 'Get out,'s houred his wife, pushing him. 'Okay,' eh said. His first, ' reaction was to turn and snarl, but his second, on seeing the loom of the truck was, to unhitch his belt, and jerk at the door handle. It creaked but wouldn't open. His wiofe was flipping her fingers at the seat belt lock, and swearing. '-----,''-----,' '------,' It was the same space as in his mind. He would have liked a blind panic but watched as the lorry flicked the Volvo passed their bonnet. Tony thoygh of flicking bogies, the kidn that led to nose bleeds. This wss going to hurt. The lorry was coming for them. He had no more time to think of analogies, as the solidity of the lorry articulated engine-housing slammed into the corsa's door. There was a slighter, more integral thump of Jonn'e head on the wheel, on its left. Glass made a bee-line into the cabin, or several beelines, swarming. Bang, said the outside fo Tony's hed\\a, as it conmnected with the opposing window. Bang, replied the inside,a dn Blackness. He opened his eeys and realised they were already open. The world swam and he felt spread around, likek the water it sswam in. He clenched his fuists and jalwine and tried to pull himself and his vision back together. Concussion, he thought is like being drunk. What's so bad about being drunk. Just as the water. He had heard this somewhere before, but it wuld be several second before he thought, Hitchikers Guide o the gLaxy. Before womndering why he ws thinking of Hitchhikers. There would eb no hitchhiking, On the motorway, everything had ground either to a halt, or uinto each other. He tried to stand. Under his hands, the hard shoulder lived up to its name, a contusion of small stones and pain on hbis shoulder and down his arm, ion hios cheek, untilt ehy rolled, and scrambled onto glass. He felt its wetness. IOt smelt like dog, and he thought, abtusely, of the navy rneault. Everythign was dark as that body work. It took him a further minute to wonder how he had stumbled up onto the hardc shoiulder, but he guessed this was what concussed people did, before thinking of his wife. 'Joanne,' he said, and ran. Neither verb worked. The word came as a croak, and his progress across the grass was that of a toad up a well ' two bounds forward and one falling down, onto the ground compacted by mid-summer sunshine (its hardness the only evidence the sun had been there, that day). All the while, he couldn't quash the image of his wife dead in the cab of the Corsa, eyes vacant as the sky above. 'Check that,' he said, on one of his many falling downs. 'The stars are out. All of a sudden.' The constellations didn't look alone, despite the absemce of a moon that should, this time of month, be high and full. Not many clouds tonight, he decided. It's not night, he added. And; I'm bleeding. He held a palm to his cheek, fingers scuttling up a line of blood to the ink-blot at it's end. On their tips, under the motorway lights, itw as a silvered pitch, [gunpowder]-like. It wasn't deep the cut but events wre beginning to be an abyss into which he was sinking. Things, all in all, were dizzying. Maybe, he thought, it's bigger than I think. He kept his sight on the ambiguity of the Corsa's silhouette, and hers, in the driving seat. Normally, it was it never anything less than indefatigable. He wanted that certainity- her certainity ' back, which was a surprise. The headlights were turned away, flushed and abashed, but the engine still turned over, with its thready hack-hack-click. He walked. He could see her, the skin of her forehead first. He had reached the driver's window. This side of the Corsa smelt of metal recently wounded. Fresh, sharp, acrid. The door handle was cracked in two. As he tugged, the half he held snapped free and sat in his palm like a cheap knuckle-duster. He shook his head to clear it but only felt a sluggish welt of new blood on his temple. It itched. Joanne was an ash-stave bent to the window, skin willow silver where the lights of the motorway reached it. Mostly, they didn't. Tony glanced back to the road. There was screming up there, beyond the embankment, and the red shades of brake lights and fire. He looked back to his wife. 'Are you okay?' he asked. She ignored him, and he reapeated the question, adding. 'We should get a safe distance away, just in case.' Then, 'Yes, yes, okay.' Tony nodded and wlalked around the car, to his side. He shivered, a welcome reminder he was alive, an unwelcome reminder that the air was chilling. Tony passed it off as fear, ignoring the goosebumps. The truck was stuck in the mud beyond the Corsa, wheels spinning, cab-speakers playing [stuck in the middle with you group]. Beyond its cab-lights was nothing, black and inhuman. The driver hadn't reacted quickly enough, and the headlights weren't on. The truck's outline was big and ill-defined as the thought that had haunted him, these last months; I should never have been a writer. Tony felt stuck. He coughed, opened the", "label": 1}

The circle of shawl around the little old lady's head seemd to set also, the cloth to tightgen as if a fist on her head. 'Old on tight,m' she said, and Tony did. The pull came all at once, but Tony saw it in stages, from the side ' in his mind ' as in three panels of a comic. A Marvel. The first; the pull. Then, him sailing over the head of alittle,old lady. The third of his crashing, scalp-long into the tree beyond, with a sound bubble. Clunk. He looked up from his new positon, an d thought, it isn't new at al ;I'm prone to being proine. (He giggled internally, and it worried him as would bleeding.) Anaemic, rust coloured dust sounkled down onto his cheeks. If there was anything fairy about it, is was the scatteringa nyphs ashes. He sneezed. 'Bless you' Sorry,' said the old lady. She extenbded a hand. My what long nauils you have, thought Tony. He got his feet (or, atlezst, his right foot) on his own, without her aid. He kenw what a pull from this dowager would do. First hand, he thought. 'Well,' the torch flickered. The little old lady thwacked it aganst a trunk. The plastic and the wood creaked, and Tony winced on their behalf. 'Dratted thing,' she said. She turned to him. The torch light ewas back, thought listless and confusedf, like an old, hen pecked husband. Tony's caught the contiours of a face beneath the cawl. He didn';t breathe. Abruptly, he felt his age; about eight, and rembered the little, old lady was just as big as him. My what a snub nose you have. My what piggy eyes. 'Follow me,' said the little, old lady, and tuend into the wood, and awalked between the trees, singing, 'Ho hum,. Ho Hum, They sing when you're up their bum. Ho hum.' Tony stared after her shawled back. As it dwinled, he followed, but not the little old lady. He followed the light. He had been too long without the light. Unbenmknowst to hi, on the other side of the tree he had hit, there was a word carved in the wood, with a heart, not a dot, above the 'I'. 'Aimee,' it said, faded in dessicated, like a message written in eth sand. The little old lady before him, witht eh torchlight before her, appeared as vague, as discoursed by watery bubbles, as a sweet dropped in coc cola. Tony kept his gaze on her shift and not on his feet and often stumbled. She led him on deep into the darkness of the wood. Tony had walked through copsese, previpously, and forests, and woods, but this was denser than even the latter; a p;lace where trees went home, he thought. His thoughts bubbled as did the (Granny) in his sight (My what anuimal parts you have) and snagged as did his toes on the feet of the great trees in this deep forest (don't you, granny, dear?). It took him some tiem and severak leagues of walking to realise he was properly concussed, and a few footsteps to forget this. The trees did not so much loom about him as he shrank, more so even than on the draught in the lift, until he were a motre, a willo the wisp, lost forever in the forest. He was essaying into the mist of his own concussuoon, the darkness inked and became palpable as clouds. It was as through stormfront at dawn, that the light peered through. Pink. It mafde an obelisk of the little old lady's form. Barred the trees. The pink fell on him, and lit hiom upm, clearing the cobwebs from his consciousness. Tony blinked, and missed the colour., He didn't blinm for some tiem. He was becoming aware of figures sat where the tree branches happened to right-angle. Children, some carrying spears. He ignored them. Only the colour appealed to him, ringing out across his skin like a bell calling him to soemthign holy, a power beyond. He walked into a clearing and didn't realise ' didn't look up to see ' that it wasn't but that te trees here had lofted up therir branche,s their canopies, their ancient, wrinkled, fgossamer leaves in praise, a haleluyah of flora. Tony had no eyes for these. On the floor, amid dirt was a flower, pink and bunched as a heart on a stem. A rose. It beart out light. Beat. Tony had never been one for gardening. To hiom, it had always been the art of giving up, retreating from pintful endeavour. Gardening leave, they called it. The hobbyr of the craked, or the retired, or the boring; synomonous with allotments. Beat. But this rose ws no gardening. Nothing could have cultivated thius, not even amother nature. The waves of pink light fortified the air; waterd the small, desicttade incubi inside that Tony may as wll have called his inner child. Balm didn't go far enough. This encased him from skin to guts to the marrow of his bones. Beat. He felt, as though drinking at the Entwash, himself growing, his elg untwisting. He bathed. Beat. Bathed in it. Staring downward, he saw rthe petal hummed delicately at each other, as though housing bees. Between the folds, down from where they touched 'just- was protected darkness that had the look of somewhere sacrosanct. Tony felt his sight falling into it, his head tipping as though a beakr pouring himself in. Beat. 'Like a fuck for the eyes, ai'nt it?' A voice said from beside him, amd Tony blinked for the second time, his sight coming back to him. He found it hard not to snarl as he turned his head. He was not alomne, of course, but neither was the speaker. Young Joanne stood beside him, t-shirt soiled in the long tyre tracks of her fingers, from whete she must have", "label": 1}

'Those petals, the way they curl and press against each other, Best description for the multi-verse I have ever seen.' 'You're a pig arren't you?' said Tony. 'The touching places are the gateways. Normally, teddy bears, believ it or not, the bears don't' particularly care. I'm used to gateways, I can tell you. Pot for instance, that was a gateway.' The figure turned to look at Tony. It's little piggy eyes. It's piggy snout. It's pigyy everything. 'Piglet. Not pig. Never pig, but that's one fo the peculararities of tThis Place. Just ask the childrrn.' It cast its chin back a degree, but Tony didn't need to look, he felt their precsne, and their spears, prickling at his back. 'Gateway to what?' 'The Blood of the poppy. This Place. So many petals, so many ways through.' 'It's so beautiful,' said oanne. Her large eyes were liquid, her pale skin cotton to soak them up. The beauty of the rose was reflected in both, and reminded Tony why he loved her. Had loved her. His heart felt as if it was on its own stem, drifting, as the pmast in Invasion fo the Bodysnatchers toward his wife. 'I'm sory,' said Tony, Neither of them seemd to hear him, the rose was thrumming, playing a note which may have been the chord that began te universe, ad was simply swelling, like an orchestra forever set to passinata. Despiet the light, the piglet's skin was wrinkled, an peach that had gone from flush to unripe to rotten. He had the loom of a woman who had grown uo pretty, before the meth addiction. Tony didn't ewant to see its teeth. Far off, discordant as an instrument dropped, vlattering in the pit, was the sound of a horn. 'The hunt is on, today,' said the piglet. 'You should sleep. We will, have to led them away from the Rose in the Wood, but they are not close enough yet.' As a child, Tony would steele onto his knees, ball his head ninto his hands, place his forehead to the carpet a,d, lie a Muslim set in motion the wrong way, rock- from side-to-side. It didn't need to be acarp[et, the bare floor would suffice, or, and this way was his favourite, denned in the duvet on his bed. The compos, softness of the forest floor ' the trees, even, seemd infused and softened by the pinkness of the rose ' blanketed him and , unable to explain his actions, he did the same. Fotal, a babe in Newton's Cradle, set to rock sideways. In this posiotn, in this place, somehow his body felt like it had gone home. Finally, he allowed the motion to carry him, hips and ribs first, to the forest floor, and stared at the shadow his silhouette made as the rose pulsed at his back. He felt rather than saw the curving trees through the corners of his eyesz, in the enveloping bower about him. He was about to allow the darkness of the trees into him, and to sleep, when he heard the approach of Joann, her thin, awkward limbs settling beside him, as a ne wborn deer behind its mother. He reached out an arm and, with it, his hand. Perhaps it was the mind he had now, reduced to a childlike snse of ease and instinct, but she had the same thoughtn, and did the same, their fingers intertwining; twins safe together in the soft,w arm twilight. Beat, went the rose, and Tony could feel the pulse of his wife's veins against his wrist, as everything came together in the loamy darkness of sleep. It totok afew moments of starin at his mother, to realise he was awake. Her curld brown hair hung around his head, er afce so close to his own face he initially thoguth she wss inside it. Curled brown hair. The grey bib, sewn with leaves as gold on afaberge egg, was gonbe. At her crown , se was as she had been ib her prime, in the yearsof his childhood. I'm not dreaming. The thought was a mental pinch but it didn't rouse him. She had taken his hand from his wife's and did what he couldn't. shaking it as she would nuts nto carrot cake, pulling himup. Tony recalled his hand in the bowl,m the ytaste of icing, the crtacked creaming of it under his cycling fingers, thick with promise. He was walking, tugged behind her, in the nighttime wake of her hair, between the trees. Onward and away from the light, like passing from an amethyst into the cave in which it hung. Tony found ti impossible not to gasp, but let her draw him on, feeling, still, econd to everything, including himself, She was his mother, after all. She's mum? There would have been room for doubt but for the shrunken size of his head, his child-sized ears, and the same could be said of the brain between them. The trees played bulldog with him, catching at his t-shirt, roots tripping his feet a she passed. Theys eemd- despite the lack of a breeze in the depp of the forest ' to be on the move. Her dark hair made her hard to see. Now, all he ad was her fingers; now he had left the cardiac-beating light of the rose behind. He held onto her fingers, but they were beginning to grind, to gnaw at him like toothless gums, as doubt had begun to, despite his underdevoped mind. She had stopped walking, but not the grinding, which increased, straining his knuckles. He shuddered, and flinched, before realisiin the insects that had landed on his temples was her hair; the soft, pulpy heat on his earlobe her breath. And, above this, her voice, enunciating clearly as she had when telling him, 'wat'ter,' not 'wat-ah'. She said, 'You", "label": 1}

He trie to sink down, to go foetal on the ground (perhapsm to rock) but she held him and he could not. There was the soft, sibilant sound of skin spiliting. It came form somehwre up her ears. Her scalp, he thought, and deep as her skull. Pointy-head. Dunce-cap-skull. Tony had seen it befor,e in the hospital ward. And with it would come the the bleeding eyes, the blood-red rent of screaming lips, and the bleeding, bloody horrific noise. There itw as; a keen that made a wind tunnel of his head, his cheeks riplling, it seemd, as they insticncely chose flight. The scream was, impossibly, composed of words, and those words ordered into rhythm, 'The Candy King is coming, He's bored of sailing the Big Sea, The Candy King is hunting, He's cancer, can't you see?' It really shouldn't be a song, Tony couldn't help but think, Banshee would have thought it ugly. this flick of sarcasm all he had with which toi protect bhimself. Sarcasm, as his teenage years had known, was thw orst form of wit, and no better a defense. She was gone, along with tehn wail. The forest echoed silence. Tony coll[ased to his knees which were not grateful for the impact. He sighed, instead of sceamed. There had been far too much of this already, and sighed again when he realised he ws lost in the dark. The rees were talking to themselves, he thought. Hew a righ and wrong, he discovered. Perhaps because the trees were moving, he found himself close enough to one to bend his ear to its bnough. The bark was a mild rebute on his skin. Inside it, he could hear it whispering to itself, in a made up language, like that of apatient in an inpatitent ward, driven madder by its situation. The darkness was complete and and in more wasys than Tony felt, himself. The holes in him fel;t conspicuous, as tough the pitch air were filling them. The hum of the trees, like bad electricity, through his ears, the pitch through his and, as though fisted, down his mouth. He felt sick, and unable to breathe, trtying too hard against the pillow of it. He sank to his haunches, scrabbd at the earth, lifted it to his face, attgempting to see something that may at least be brown. And culdn't, and felt it against his eyesballs. He moaned, and screamed and scrabbel at the eyes, and liked the sound of hims elf, and treid to scream again bu7t couldn't. then darkness was keeping it down. He shrank still,ma d more so than the size hehad been before, even more than AS A SIX YEAR OLD. The nigfht terror5s were back, but there was no night-light to eb left on, or bedrrom door ajar to the landing, the shaft of it across the all at the head above his bed, o the board.His eyes were weeping and wioth more than the irritation of the grit, what was inside might as well have been seeping out of him through these ducts, forced by the over occuptation ogf the endless night., Itrw as getting mighty crowded in his head, what with all the fear, and the so9unds of the forest. The snaking hiss of tree roots moving therough soil, coming t get hum, and worse things, thikngs that were joined at the hip and the motuyha nd wished o be joined with him, by the teeth, and by theatin g. asd ba man he had always been on the short sid,e hencxe all the wiritng, but he haD FORGOTTENM WHAT IT WAS TO BE TRULY SMALL. THE WILD REMINEDE HIM, and then, amist, the shifyting of the forsrt, the mewling of his thoygyst, he heard the sinbging. It was soift, liltingso much it might just fall over, the sound of someone who had lost someone close and would bubble into song, instead of tears, at odd times ' in the shower, cooking ' without knwoign quite why. 'Somethere over the rainbviow ' went the song [add Amy at the end, in the garden] Through the remnant of the dirt, he saw dots of lilac light. Like punctuation from Yet's '[]', like twilight getting its act together and gathering. It gathered into the form of a little girl with a lilac dress who was dancing. In a heavier manner tah that of the lilac full soitps and commas, Tony pulled himsefrl together and rose and followed her. Light was not something he was goignto pass up, nor let pass him by. Opportuiniy dots, he thought, his mind still on kilter. E walked as though ina stiff breeze that didn't exist, bent to the righr, but he walked, and, soon, eh could see the dim haxze of pink, like that of asun thiknign about rising, but couldn';t yet be bothered. If he hadn't been doing so already, the sight would hav e made him cry. A shape passsedc by him. Tony turned. Joanne, eyesz closed, legs and arms stiff, but the former moving a jagged, Minty python walk, the latter still at her side. The Minisitry of Funny Sleep walking. It reminedev him of her at the end of their relationship. 'Never sleep walked in my life,' she had ssaid, 'except whn I walked into the registry office and marriage with you. I'll tell you what, though, I'll be running out of this shit, though. My eyes are finally wide open to what you are, you arsehole.' Her eyes weren't wide opne rioght now. Tony looked back toward the pink. The lilac dressed girl was gone, whoch didn't surprise him, somehow, as it wouldn't if he found out the fairy phtos were fakd, and wilo wisps diodn't really exist. It would be hard. Hwoever, to walk away from the pink. He couldn't leave her like this, unheeding of", "label": 1}
{"text": "the dark, striding into it. No matter how funny the walk, there was an intelligence out there didn't know human humour, and only knew the taste fo a human's seweta, their blood, their gunge, their cholic. Tony didn't know how he knew, this bbut he did and eather wished he didn't. He followed his ex wife. Eyes wide open, he thought. And brain stupid. It was hards. Even with the pallour of her skin, she was a ligthter charcoal than the coal-pitch of the forest, and quickly subsumed within it, as though it hard simply rubbed her out, blended her in. He hurriede and triopped, and hurried, again, and tripped more. Then, another light. The flickering, coca cola, off gold of the Piglet's torch. The colour was of raked up autumnbral leaves, golden. So much so it made Tony think of a New Hampshire fall, the microcosm of every tourist brochure and aryticle. Like most places, He had never been there. Like most writers, he had travlled extesively, in his mind. He was like the antagonist in the Wtefboys Song, the Whole fo The moon', but for the fact that he only imagined it all, and, no doubt, inaccurtal;ey. Itw asdn't aonly a money thing, Tony reckoned. He was at heart timid as a shrew. As his feet scucced like small clopuds across the soil, disconnectedm portending nothing, he noticed for the first time that nothing in the forest seemd to be dfoing any falling. Neither the levaes nor the temperature which remained at the height of summer, even in the innards of the wood. He swaeted as he walake,d and not All of it was fear. He wss the only on who felt like keeling over, but tahtw as probably the lack fo sleep talking. This wasn't. 'Blood of the poppy. Spoon full of suigar for m. Bloody the poppy into mine. Sugar in a spoon,' said a voice rising and cracking like thre piuzza boy in The Simpons, thought Tony. Tony couldn't see the speaker, hidden as itw as behind the silhouette of his wife. It was, he knew, the poiglet. Bfeore the torchlight and small fire, the edges of which played at the shadow fo her heels, Joanne seemd a Guy on a pyre. She twied on her feet slightly. She hd always been a convenient scapegoat, ir so she had always said, for his lackof success. Joanne idn't answer the small pig, azand iyt didn't seem to need her to. He was talking through, her but not to Tony. 'Blood and suagr, poppy and me.' Tony saw shadows moving between her legs, like a propleller staryting, and as he skirted her right arm ' and took it and drew her back from the fire ' he realised the piglet was ravelling his own arm, and a tourniquet around it. As Tony watched, the pig passed atrotter across his forearm, piokinga nd then his nose, truflleing, it seemed for a vein. At last the snuffling sound became mucusyd with glee. The piglet too as spoon was which was resting ona spit over asmall fire and pushed a needle into it. The liquid in itw as a broiling, vapourous white, like liquidified, ngry ghost. And wouldn't they be angry? Thought Tony. The needle took it and thence, by a clinical-quick actionw as transferred to the vein the piglet had hunted out in the wrinkled pallour of his skin. There seemd , at elst by this light ot be very little pin k left. The piglet rocked back onto his back and allowed the spoon and the needle to fall. It's point carve and exclamation mark intot h soi;, made to lookm deeper and more shocked by the angle of the fire. 'Oh, by Eeyore's tail, that pins the fucking spot. Oh, Wicth, yes, if you, any of youw ere still eher, you'df think this better tan sex, and wer all know what sluts youw ere. Mmm hmmm,' The piglket's rambling had taken off, in contrast with its body, which seemd staved to the dirt, clawed by ectasy. The piug shivered in its grip. Its eyes were big and black aenoguhto make Tony think of their surroundings. The puippils seed to go on forever, much as the poiglet's talking did. 'Forst there was that girl. Wjhat did they call her, oh, yes, indeedy, Aimme, and she killed the wicked witch of the north. Why what an ingenous youing lady, Not the witch, you see, but the Aimmee. Then the Candy ing came and what do you know you killed rhe witch's bitch-sisters, of the South, of the East, and the West, and even that thieving runt, North by North West. She aqs always a good for nothing wicked witch, that one. He set fire to the north and melted the ice, and set blue tot eh sky,a nbd theire was a bog sea as far as the ee could see, and a big skya s far as rthe would, fi it could, but it couldn't, but for catching the C word, you see. The King candy. Are you bored yet. I'm not. Oh no, I'm high as the heat,a dn low as a anasty little addict. Therre's no inbetween with me. And you.' The blck eyes fixed on Tony. Or perhaps they ddin';t, itw as difficult to tekll without the white or the ireses. 'You come intot he light.' The piglet gestured, then arced back to mon into the air, and press it shoulder blades into the ground. Nonetheless Tony walked forward ;etting Joann'e hand fall. There was slap, and she stirred , her eyelids fluttering openinga sthoughthe slap had been from him afainst her check,a and not self-admisiterd to the thigh. She moaned, but the piglet moaned louder, eclipsing her. 'Clooooser. Ther are so many gateways in these parts, in This Place, and I've been through afew. Mind you, the gateway I chose ' the skunk- is behind me and closed, I'm through it no, into te blood", "label": 1}
{"text": "of the poppy. You shoudlmnsee how big the poppies grow these days, it's like slaughtering a bear. Bend closer.' The pigklet shivered again, and action which took him, crawling on his back, several inches toward the fire. The piuglet didn't see,m to mind it eheats. Tony ebnrt. He felt the f=blaze aginst his eyes, the spasm of heat in hsib eyebrows. He wandered if they wre blackening, carttonish. 'I see thin gs, with these eyes, in the blck of the forest,a awy from the pink.i see things. I canm tell you., I can tell you. I can tell you the one bearing the devil will kill the Candy King. That's what we're waiting for,. All us cast-aside boys. All us addicts.' EWit this, the pigket reared, until it stood as though susopeneded by strings, on the ends f its trotters. It grasped Tony's face between his trotters. 'Where am I?' Tony heard Joanne moan. 'Why am I moan?' 'No'' Hissed the piglet. 'Not you.' H elet go, and, fell back aginst the eartj, causing tony to wince. @yoyu're not the one.' Tony's wince stuck, as though there was wind down here, and it had changed. 'She said that,' ehs aid. 'My mum.' 'Yes.' Th e piglet nodded. It hugged itself. 'The queen of tumoiurs.' 'The queen of tunmours?' He had to ask. He hated ti whn people didn't ask. 'Your mother.' [the horns, the horns' more of the hunt] The hair stood up on Tony's neck, pulling the skin with it, into goosebumps. that felt as big as goose eggs. They coiuldn't be, of course, but then the hunters couldn't be as big nor as liquid as they sounded, on the otrher side of liens of bushes, or banks of drioed-out gullies. Neither could they be as mutated, could they? There ws only so much wrong that could be allowed to survive, surely, without rupturing an aretry, oror 2aqndering so far off the path of Nature that they lay down and died. Tony hid where he was told to, and ran at a point from the Lost Children, trying to be as silent as their feet. He hid, now, beneath the claw fo a large laburnum tree. He crouched in fallen, ochre, oranhge pods, like the bitter tears of atree thatw a sabout to die and really felt it ahdn;'t done enough with its life. Tony knew how it felt, or he would have, done, could he feel anything but fear. His calves ached, as did his knees and, just for good measure, his hip joints joined in. He didn't dare sit down. The Lost Children would point again, with their fingers or the hewn-ended sticks they carried, and they would run once more. The time after the Piglket had been spent in the glow of the rose, waking and sleeping like passing from one amethyst into another. But then they ' the whole trope- had moved on. They wnted to lure the hunt from the rose. They were bait. Tony tried not to breathe. He wriggled but could not yet move. Bait, his mind agreed. He wondeed if another worm would come up from, behind and beneath him, and give away his position, and hoped not, then hoped so. His fear was drawn longer than the spears the Chidlren carried, btu was sharp at both ends. His head was becoming thck with thtoughst, like ants over sugar. He thought of the two bopdied creature in the savanna grass. He thoguth whatever hunted them now sounded bigger. He thought he heard barking, and by barking his ears meant many dogs, a pack. He thought about the ant, bublling, metasising,a nd woonrede what would happen to him. He didn't give a shit a nbout a rose. He hinched his shoulders and made himself even smaller tjan he flet. He looked across at the Lost Children he could see in the gloom, lighter here, near the edge of the forest- where they had led the predators. The Lost children were beige smudge son blurred brown bluffs. A landscape amateurely painted,w ith accidentally, but watchful; moraines where they should not be. They were coiled. Where the refractions of grinding light hit them, them they were the dark rust of old, discarded metal, in ,lines alomg their limbs and in their hair. Highlights by a painter more professional. They, and the cahse they led the Candy King, piut him mind of the old saying. I don't need to outrun the bear, I just need to outrun you. Tony didn't know why th e forests made him think of bears, but they did, and itw asn't dwelling onteddies, that was for sure. If they were the bait, the Lost Children were the hooks. Tony knew where that put him. Wriggling. As a child Tony had been gullible. As an adult, he had been the same. Now, he was a chld again, he recalled the tiem he had gone camping an dlocal children had convinced him a witch was in the forest, and made him hide behind a bush until it became dark, and his family came calling for him. (Between the trees a bugle sounded. It was difficult to tellm precisel;y where the sound of the call came from, bexcept that it sounded wet as desire.) Of course, that coudlnt' be true, here, cpould it. There weren't any witches. The little pig had said all the witches were dead. Killed most;ly by the Candy Kimnga nd his minions; the suit of tumours. It was enough to make one sick, thought Tony. As Lost Child pointed with his stick, and they were running, once more. His bad ;eg was carrying acudgel behind him, as would a troll. No, that the pink of the rose had been left behind its ligh no longer suffused his injurioes and they, like the rolling bback of tidal waters, were beginning to sump back into the rest of hinm, filling him with black, foetid bilge. He looked across and saw Joanne", "label": 1}

Her t-shirt, taut as it was 0-n caught bgy sweat and grime to her torso, flutterd a little at her back; a tightly furled banner coming unfurled. Tony' breath was becoming haerdc to find. His lungs felt as though they were forced to go truffling for it, by the sound iof their snuffling and wheezing, and really did rewsent the effort. He staggerd to the right and into a tree, and away, spinning like a top about to fall. He thought of the last shot of Inception and wished he was dreaming, and wandered if this would be last turn he made, but the hunt hadn't caught them yet. He was caught, abruptly, by a trotter. Itw as like being caugfht bettn a rock and hard place. He steadied in neck-cricking snap, so only heard the little pig's, 'You're gonna get caught, Gonna give you a piggy back.' Wjhen he was wrenched onto its thin, pink back. Well, pink but for the vomit hues o its hawawaiin shirt. His feet, dangling, even shruneken, longer than the little pifs body, dragged train ytracks, through the dirt. 'Run,' shouted Tony, into the piglet's ear. He was looking back at the woods behind him, withoutn realising he was doing so. All his eyes, and the brain behind ghthnem, had space for was the conjoined quintipluts behind him, fulluy grown, and taking up much of his vision. They wer enear the forest-eaves. The fiove of tumour 9for what else could it be) was gaining, both on the piglet and on Tony's peripereal vision, eating at everything he cou;ld see as it approached. It raised a horn to his lips and blew it. 'Shit,' said Tiny as though the bugle had blown this through his throat. The couyns do fhis curse was loots int eh woods coming ablaze with answering calls. So this is what gfoxes feel like, thought Tony. Folowed bu, wush I was cunning, or, even betterm, fantastic. But he wasn't. He was about to eb caught by Boggis and his mutant kin. Jesus. Pineapples jostled between hgis thights. Bees seemed o buzz and evacuate th Hawain shirt as though giving up on the hive. 'Jump off and run,' the piglet shouted ievr its shoulkder. 'No,' replied Tony. 'You'll not bait this hook so easily.' 'Idiot,' shouted the piglet,a sd threw him ver iust shoujder, forwards into a bush. The disturbneed leaves reminded him of the bees. They scratched angrily at his cheeks, forehead, forarms. Tony came to a rest in series of bad-sahvi ng cuts, like rain on the side windows of a quick moving car. He felt blood in stringed beads on the exposed palnes, rips in sladshes in his t-shirt. He let the blood move, droibblign an dcollecting in pearkling beads,a ndidn't nmove at all apart from these. There was a blare of heat on his skin which ' sweat filled pore by sweat fileld pore0 he realised was not coming from the terror inside him. His eys rioleld horsihly, and saw that sunlight impaled istswelf through the lumoijnous green of the waving eaves, at the other side of the bush. Now, he thought, I'm between a mutant and cancer. Anybody who kenbw anything about the metasising of cells would have founds it diffuilacult to choose between the two, and Tony ' as any writer0- was all fr procrastinating. He lay. He listened. He made the soil wet with sweat. Number five, as his fear-soued brai jad take to callingit, ran passed ina a legiuon of limbs. Well, a cadrem, he added, pedantically. Now, it seemd was atime for the little thinds and taking, fi not pleasure in the, then a bitter saitisfactyion. The itch of sweat in his t-shirt. The way he had weed him self in aspurt. The chewed jaw-stoppefr of breath hold up and rotting behind his teeth. Nuymber five sounded his bigle,a nd, not far behind, anotr replied. This callw as slower moving. No call to panic, thoughnt Tony, and instantly did so, The spurts became aflow. Tnank gOd I'm not wraing underwear, he thought. He gripped the dirt as though to ground himself. it didn't work. His thought sna mind spurted with his penis. That's what you think witn, anyway. Isn't it a hot day, tra la la, you're th victim.# Oh, bugger. That other creatire, the second, ios close by. Hmmm, listening to its feet, I'll call hgim nuber three. Oh dear. Number three has stopped,# Nimber three si sniffing with three quite separate pairs of nostrils. Three tiems two equals I'm screwed. Thnelaves at his feet, where he entered ths patriculat predicament, parted, revealing a face that had been blureed, as if by shutter speed. Into three. There were'niot enough eyes, and nowhere enough by way of sanity, but it smiled agreeably enough. 'I would very much likento introiduce to my kinbg, young man,' said the three of tumours. TYony had never felt quiet so young, nor anywhere enar as unammed. At least his bladder was relaxed. No otrher organ of himwas; his heart felt as though it thought it legs were running, his legs souned as if they jpoined in with this self-decption, his kith would relly rather have liked to scream, nbut didn't feel up to the job. The three of tumours filled in for this, opening all of its maws and keening. Why, became ss apparent as the end of the lost Children's sharpened sticks, when Tolny saw a spear sticking out of the the first neck, the one his mind had allocated to the triplt on the left.

Number three ws no longer advancing but two and three or its conjoined body were clawinga t the back of the first, withn ajnds coming away bloodied. Tony wonredred how much blood they hd to lose. It was becominhg excessive. They had it, now, howvere, by the liquid-sticky end of the stic,, but did pull, instead, drawing the spear throught he first body which was now handging deadweight, pulling the other two to Tony's left. Bush-leaves jostled liem jazz hands. Then Tony caught a glimpse of the Loist Child. He was too addled by terror to be conused. Ina straighter frame of mind, he would have thoguyht; why aren't you runnigm? Why are you still jhere? Now, all his mind did was except what his eyes force fed it, an, somehow, managed not to shut down. The Lost Chid was staring at him, eyes as still as a face that is sleep walking, and allowed the three of tumours to draw it him. Itw as a him. His flat chest smeared by too long out herree. He was an elf now, no lonegra boy, ti seed, a changling of Tnis Pace, left exposed. But he had survived against the odd, againsttn he commnasd of this Candy King, and now he was sacrificing himself for Tony. He thinks I'm the one. He's wrong. Four sensible hands took the boy in their grip, allowing some roaming across his body, while tjhere ws enough to grip him. They need't have. The boyw asn't for running. The two other arms of the three of tunmours hing i8nsesible and swuing as it tottered about and hefted the Lost Child off the soil, and , by the bush to Tony's left, into the sunlight he could feel sizzling, as a sausage might the incipient heat of frying pan, close at hand. He kept his fongers aeway, for fear not so mich of scol,ding as cancer. Therw as a rustle at Tony;'s right, and he closed his eyes, tnr off now, he begged his mind, liem C34PO. 'It's me,' said Joanne. A voice his eaqr knew so well it could well be on the inside of it. 'I've been hidjng nearby. You let that tnhinsg take the biy.' Eyes opening. Tony nodded. 'He thinks you're the one' Joanne hissed. Her whispers were always too loud., always in public, always accustastory, 'You're not.' Tonyt shook his head. So, she had been aawake, beforewe th piglet. 'And ou'rw going to let hi,m die anyway.' Better him than me. He didn't say this. He saids, 'Yes.' And tried his best to lookm ashamed. He felt only fearl, still, crocuhingw ithin him like jaguar about to ponce, and justg as black. 'Sire,' he heard. Tony didn't know, if he craned his head, if yhe iopened his eyes, if he had any spine whatsoever to do either fo these thinbstg with, he would see berteen the foliage. 'It's the Candy King.' Joann'e whisper was quietned, now. Yes, he would be able to see, he ould only surmise. 'Sire,' the three of thmours repeated, with two of its mouths. An echo between close alls. 'We have n offering.' 'Ah, yes, ah yes,#' acme a vpice, obscuredc by cloth or the husking of a sack, ro some such thing. Tony didn't want to se, and his mind refused to imagine it. 'Up with his head, up with his head.' The voice was wet, lisping, and cut right through him. 'Up with his head.' It made a gurgle sound, appreciative a s Getman burp, but backwards. Beside Tony. Joanne gulped,a nd then could, be heard to reretcvh, as though she could not swallow the scene, or it jhad goine down the wrong way. To her, ot wasn't supposed to happen like this, Tony, knew, he was supoeds to throiw himself before th rtumoru, out into the sunlight. But he had always disappointrd her, and Tonyn coul;d not quite work out how she could, npretend to be surprised. JHe tighten the grip his eyelids had on his eys,a nd tried to listen to the sound of somtheing wetm, tumesecent, grasping thre Lost Chil'd head, his face, nor the sound of it sucking. He recalled thre shadow play on the ward-wall. He treid to imagie hews not here at all, but in a pristine, snow bound forwsart, the caw of hyungruy crows. He ahd enoguyhn of an imagiknation,m at leats, to spare him this. But the way the cancer moved swiftly thporugh the young boy/'s body was invasivce. It moved though Tony, ion its way, the image of it. He couldn't shake it, and wouyldn';t be abl to, for many days. He added tears ro the copver of his pupils, but theh diodn;t fill his earhole,s and his ciowardicxe extebded to his fingers which he found rooted to the soil. H couldn't move them. Eith a gulping more successful than that of his wife, the Cnhady koingf, or whatever anybody called him, gulped ndown the Lost child as if he were a thick, prtien supplement. Get that down you, Tony couldn't' help but think. 'Sire,' the thereof tumours could be heard to say. 'Could I interest you in a scumtious desret? Why just down their in the earth.' 'Quiet,' said the king. In the distancem, ahorn could be heard. 'Sire,' repetade three, rtying, ti seemd, to be insisrent. 'Silence,' the Candy King became petulant. @how dare you sir.

The memories stacked up in t eh air above us like airplanes that cpould nti be allwed to land, liem 9/11. Still, we followd. The Lost Boy led us around the eavse fo the wood, and by these, to the tal savanaa grass. Before long I rcognised the fall of sun ligh, the patrerns of foliage and the shapes the sun braneded into the earth. He s taking us to rabbit hole and, I guess he supoosed; home. We followed, and, before what I thoguth waas long (the sun may or may not be above the overgrown vegetation but, fi itw as never, it neither waned nor waxed to noon), we [assed to corpse of the ant, an, by this faintly bubbling makrer, to the hole. The Lost Boy passed it's weapon to Tony, who received like a relay runner who thoguth he was more likely to droip the baton. I didn't look at him, but down intot eh dark of the hole. Somehwere beolow twere the furtuive sound of burrowing and I thought of stroing, well-evolved shukders, sharp claws, eyes broghetend by the though if our flesh to feed on. Then hole seemd tighet viewed from abouve. We descended. Down the rabbit we wriggled. I, first, Tony making a meal of his liump, as he did when pretending not to understand recipes, or what to buy in the supermarket, so that I took the lead. He was useless, really. Really useless. Really. I was not quite first, but pushed the Lost Boy's stick before me, and followed this, its point lost in the dark of th e warren in a way I wished the bright eyes would be, but weren;t. they were bright with malice, and more bold than they had been before, closer, and bigger, niot just because of the promiximity, but due to way things grew big in This Place, under that sun. The stick kept them at bay and following it I felt like the string behind the needle, going through the eyelet. Behind me, when I looked back. Ton y was a pallid stretch of forearms, and grimed cheeks, wriggling like a paparplegic worm, in wide oscillations. If we were thepale string what kind of shroud were we weaving? It wouldn't cxover the dyting world we returned to. And why was I thunking this way, what was with all the questions? There would be too few left to answer them. We reached the bottom of the rabbit hole, and the lift below it and, by the rope, climbed down into its chamber. Besides ourselves in apssing, the end of the rope still held the decanter, but it was filed again, woth green, viscus liquid. On its stopper was tagged another crumpled, ancient-yellow note which read, in the carefulcalligraphy fo someone who had not noticed the world was ending, 'This Will Take You Forward' [calligraphy?] The lift stank of half eaten meat and cat faeces and cat vomit besides, where the feline had lefta ragged line near the doors. It looked the attempted digestion of a aspien. There was no sign of the bald rabbit. The cat itself slept in the corner, oblivious to the smell it had created. Its features did have the appearance of disgust, bt this was its normal look. I pressed my forearm to my nose, both fileteringt he mirk of the lift, and taking in the scent of my own sweat, tight and musty and heavy as a small wardrobe full of ancient, fur coats. I needed a shower, as much to watch away what I had seen as what I smelt like. The floor reader was stuck to [square root] -1, the arrow bent up and awayu from the number as though in a sharp excla,mation mark of shock. The 'I' of the information button was still lit, and through the interciom could be heard, through the interference of electrical spitting, that sound of a bugle clearing its throat. I shivered and helped Tony to the tiles of te florr, and to miss a trail of mactated rabbit. He sliped,r egardless, on a puddle of unseen urine, and scowled. I shrugged. 'The doors won't open,#' I said. 'You've tried them?' I shrugged again, but quicker, as though throwing his question off, as though he were a monkey. 'They won't open.' H etried them. They didn't. I unstoppered the bottle of green liquid and took a sniff and gagged, and used my forearm, again, but lower, against my lips, which wera tight line of shut. 'That good?' His smile was as wan as the rest fo him. We had seen the sunlight, but neither of us had felt the sun in too long. I could have said, 'It smells of despair, of rott, but not any old body, I think I can smell my perfume in it. I think it smells of my body just after I die.' But thatw as his kind of way of speaking, and I ws seek of anything writerly. 'Yeah, great.' 'We're gonna have to, aren't we?' He was still smiling and it ahd been there too logn. I could see his cheeks twitching from the effort of keeping it stetched over his bteeth. The impalers were beinning to show, like a vampire that couldn't keep up appearances. That, thoug, is how he always looks to me, especially in public. 'Down the hatch,' I said,and drink. My left hand vl;ecnehs on the stopper, as a tatse as vile as the smell inside the lift floods me. I concentrate on hard balled glass beneath my fingers and, at first, don; notice them stretching, or the unclipping of my vertebraeas, as my spine lengethened, or balling then ballooning of my breast. The not noticing dowesn't last long, hwoever, and I crumple to knee which are as high", "label": 1}

I spata dn looked up at Tony through eyes that had garnered their own pool of liquid. 'Your round,' I said, but it is hiss,m and more bile dribbles out, and I give up. He seems to get the gist, besides, and walks up to me and, taking thedecanter, drinks. I ignore his mewling, as I do whenever he has man flu, and wait until it is over, then ros,e and press '3'. With a judder then a lurch the lift jolts forward nd keeps gouing in that direction. They huddled in the cornber of the loifdt6 like rabbi9ts in their hurcyhes, lefdt out in the cold of the garden. All that was left of the real rabbit wcould be seen riudging the vomit. Tony hugged himselg around the t-shirt's logo ('Breaking Good', by Qwertee, of Walkter White in a Pontiff's hat, giving a blessing) and by there the t-shirt hugged his ribs. Kneeadxed with sweatm, as it had been, the cotton had been cooling ever since the lift doors had reopened, back on '3', giving his abdomen what felt like a thin skate of ice, as that overa puddle when winter comes. A little like the Place they had been, that jkidn of ice was not something to rest your faith on. Yet, 'We have to go back,' said Joanne. Either the chil or his wife jhad pushed his teeth to rest precariously on each other, on their edges, and grinding techtonically. This was as good as it got. His mind felt like the edge was somewhere far behin d it, a line which was now only vaguely visible. 'Yeha, tell me about it.' By which he meant; don't. He didn't know how much more of the cold or the hunher he could stand. He kenw he couldn't take any more of his wife speaking. Everything inside was a stechnotnic as his teeth. They were in the back two corhners of the lift. Sepearetde by a bank of earth where it had skittered when the lift had plunged forward. After the button had been pressed, the speed fo their acceleratuion hads borne both Joanne and Tony onto theirt toes lie,k evil spirits in Japanese hoprror movies., These days, horror movies just semed like grinding realism. Across the tirles of the lift, the cat, its faeces, its vomit and, just as uncoordinated, Joanne and Tony had skidded back intot eh wall furthest from the door. He found it impossible to fihjt his way forward. The air might as well have been a tsunaqmi in full flow. Him, a stavened insect. Now, the lights in his body felt as if he was going out This was the natural tinme to die. Never mind George Martin, winter had come in however lon g they had been in That Place. Like his wife, Winterw asn't for fucking around, ti seemd. 'We're just fuckinga round here,' said Joanne, proving her earlier point. In motions of zombie determination she rose. She shiverede as though her skin were coming loose and strode through the smear moarks of hwart had been left on the tiles to the lift controls. Before them, like wincing eyes, the lift doors were firmly shut. They had opened as the licfdt ahd erached '3' half an hour ago, or so, with a hiss as though the kift were exhaling its last, and all the life and warmth opf ti lefdt and steamed out into a dark corridor. Tony guessed the lights had gone out wherever the sun had gone. It miust be quite some party there, bhe thought. 'wait,' he said, He didn't know why7. She was doing thw pnly thin g they could do. Gpign backl There, where the suit of tumours would hunt theme for their andy King. In the end *(their end, it may as well be called) ythe cold was a better huntsmantahn anyth other tyhing, and looked set to serve them, chilled as from the fridge, to its master, Death, in the nexty few hours. T-shirts were not the thing to be seen in during the apocaplse, iot cvould be safely said, Joanne stared at him. Her eyes said what but her mout didn't btoehr. She pressed the '-1'. Tony looked up,. The light red terminator eye of the cctv camera had winked out, but he imagined the scene, from above, of an ex wife and ex-husband, in the grey, colourless, pixelletadde mddle of the cctv. The warmth and gone out of their relationship as surely as it had gone from the lift. And she didn't know about Maragart. He did. Itw as ahrd for his mind to let go of the image of his mother-in-laws sneering lips around his penis, in the downstairs toilet. It was difficult, at thr very least. The lift went down. As a writer, Tony was good at formulating a narrative about himself. He could have been great, but for the way his wife made him work. He oculd have dedicated himself to his craft, in chilly, unheated council flats and worked his waty down into the flesh of the world, in a housing estate, like a bad seed amongst broken families. But, at times, events conspiured with his wife to press his mose uop against the window of himself so hard it crackerd then shattered the pane. This was not a pleasant experience for someone who thought he knew hwo he was. A writer. This was one of those experiences. The narrative of arc of himself become ashatterdc scimitar. Frozen then broken, each segment cutting at him and nto one of them magical, and none of them ever, ti felt, tp be reassembled into a weapon that could fight back this nevereneding darkness.

Crawling up through the rabbit hole, crocked because of huis ebnt leg, he was a tendril from that ad seed. He had gone beyond shivering, his limbs grinding where they were not held tense against each other, tight as his teeth. The rabbit droppings,now that he was pressed against them inthese tunnels, had passed beyond the discreet brown baubles they were up, in the open, and against his clammy skin, felt full and liquid as the plague on the body of a corpse/. Contained tight as he wasw, his mind, his perception wass in bits. He hunted a adiolescent, fur-bound rabbit, in its warrens and kuilled it in bits,. Darknes, then the thrusting of the Lost Children's stick. Squels of terror and pain. The cries fo its parents, its mother, Tony could onluty think ' from the pitch. Furtively skinning its fur from ist flesh, up in That Place, beneath the fgiant, prehistioric, savanna grass, Bloodied Rib cages of fauna beneath the green riubg=cgades of the flora that strreteched aabive. He didn't waste a bit. Flashes of cooking the raabiit's meat in triangules of sunlight, at the edn fo the same stick. Of turning and drying and curing the hide in the sun. The b0ne shsarpened for dggers. The eyballs cooked along with the rest. His stomach wasn't for turning anytign out. He worked feverously, with flashes of lucidity, barbecuing meat, skinning, killing, and going around the merry go round of slaughter again , all the time his ears pruicked high and twitching for the sound of the hunting horn. The periods of lucidity dimmed and scurried from eacj other, leaving long expanses of frightened, twitchy, savaargry when Tony would have thought himself an animal if he jhad thought at all. He heard the horn, but always in the distance. There were children out tther, to be chased, after all. Joanne didn't follow hi monto the surface, which was a good thing, he would think later, when thinking retirned to him. H ehad always wondered what would becaome of his temper if he ever turned senile. Itw a s snewy monster beneath the fathioms of his manners, his smiling civility, charm shot therough with flashe of of teeth. They had glimpsed enough of the animal tighter, and, in thos emomenets, it would have been hard to see the human. Eventually he decscended back though the tnnels of blood and the stench of sweat soaked with terror, and where, by the smell, he had [pissed to scent his own territory. Coming back to himaelf, he descended the rope, and sunk the green liquid, and tossed furs onto Joanne, who had dwindled in her corner fo the lift as stars do at dawn, to the extrems of the horizon. Stil, she atem the meat, and wore the hides and when they had steeld themselves, she pressed the button to take them back, againm. [On first look; two things. The screen flicked every six seconds betweens scenes so close in their particulars the differences were difficult to spot. It seemed, instead, to be one segment omna loop. It wasn't. The date in the bottm left ahand corne may have stayed the same, but the time at the opposite right ticked om. Secvonds later, it would seem impabacble. The second; the grey of the cctv images gave the skin of the bodies ont eh salbs a pallour that suggested the doctor with the scalpel cutting into their braisn couls only be a cornoer. He wasn't. The heart monitors at the back peaked in denying, robust, inverted v-signs. Second laterm the viewer would wonder how their hearts continued at all. Closer inspection, showed three very separate bodies. A man, a woman, a child. An obese, hair threaded man. A scarecrow, small chinned woman. A little girl. Closer inspection, however, would not bring rwards, only sanctions, when all three sat up on their surgical tables., opened their mouths, screamed, their scalps drawing back as though yawning lips over tooth white skulls. The instant sheen of blood,m collecting, somehow, in the corners of their eyes and flowing from there, as though they cried so hard they had burst the ducts. Their temples stetching, going straight up. Pointy headed patients. The camera flicked from one scene to the next, all three, at the sam time, risen to a right angle and wailing, while around them, like the flicking of the cameras, surgeons hands flapped, anaethesiatics tagged their machines, interns vomited on the grey floor. 17.41. It said. 17.41. 17.41. And all the while, the pointed,m drawn skulls with their grey, silent screaming.] [He reached toard the screen and around the side of the image, as though sctracthing at an itch the viewer couldn't see, and eh could barely reach. By the look on his face, the itch was not gojgn away.

The lips cut out the shapes of wordcs that ocyuld only be four-lettered but, by the cut of his suit, the straightmness of his tie, the way hbis jowls, even fattenede by a good wage cheque and too little time for exercise, managed to stay straighta dn severe, the four letteredxc words would bealoing the lines of 'Hell,' an d 'God's' and 'Sake'.

He put a fin ger under her nsoe and held it there until he could feel her breathing. It was weak but it was there, he decided. Sliding his hand between the front seats his fingers clippd the seat belt holder and returned to it. Unclipping the belt, he tried to pul her to him, couldn't (she had always been heavier than him and, now, Tony cursed his taste in women) and slid fowrad so that he squatted over the gear-stick. From there, he could worm his fingers under her buttocks. Ignoring the memories of their last time, he pulled her across the upholstery. She was on his side, now, and he lowered his feet to the turgid moor, grappled her arm around his shoulder and managed to light her to lean against his torso. Swetaing, he faced the lighst of the motorway. On it, a car exploded, and the moor's heather hissed and rattled delicately. He comvinced himself that the ongoing screams were glass under pressure, metal slowly rending. 'Yeah, we're going that way,' said Tony, hissing himself, as he began walking. [Corsa a shade lighter than his, empty but for smears of blood and the odour of dog] The keys were in the ignition. He could see them because the doors were unlockd and he slid his wife into the back seat. He pinioned her against the upholstery and tried to plug the seatbelt in. His hand, sweaty all the way up to his armpit, slid off it, coouldn't make it 'click'. He couldn't lie her down, she might slide off and into the footwell, where, semi-conscios as she was, head might land at an odd angle, throat might be bent to an odd angle, she might die. The sweat on his pale arms was chilling, beading like a fine ' [white wine] in the fridge. Tony needed a drink. 'I'll catch my death.' He looks up at the sky. It's the first time he considers the cold and his flesh goosebumps,a nd not all of it at the temperature. It had been a barbecue day, the kind where the t-shirt on yoru back stuck as uncomfortably cksoe qand c,oying as the gaze of his mother in law, and the memory of what they had shared in the toilet. He trid not to turn the sausages too nervously, too often, or to touch them. Obviously, not after the coat cupboard. He chose the burger. The back seta smelt of dog and there, like that, he as bac. itw asn't that kidn fo day, not anymore. he couldn't' leave her here and pulled Joanne back from bthe rear door, and dragged her in in a crackle of tramnac beneathn the heels of her trainers to the boot. Leaning her frame against the bumber and with burgeoning breaths her unhitches the booit-door, and rolls her, shoulder first., second - breasts, then legs, onto its carpet. Funny, but later, waking in the hospital ward, I won't recall any of this, but will feel the bruise on my left temple. Instead, then, I dream of my old dog from, my garden in Newcastle. Pippin. I loved that dog; funny little bugger. Funny. 'What are you doing?' The sweat on Tony's skin sharpened, droplets digging in like eye-teeth. He feels himself flushing. the night hangs dark, velvet-winged, batlike, and, feeling like it might be sucking him dry; vampirish. The voice came again, growing as it neared, its BBC accent towering in the gloom. 'Well' what are you doing?' Tony pinches his eyes - seeking out the speaker. It said, 'Come on and help her, won't you?' Tony shut the boot. The sound of it closing had the finality of his wife's head on its upholestry. 'Come on!' Its BBC accent was not to be argued with, not by a Southerner, and Tony hastened toward it, and the outline of its owner which towered like the spoken tones; over him; over the woman at the stranger's side. De ja vous, thought Tony. there's another of you. As BBC was taller than him, this woman was shorter than Joanne, but injured in the same places; across the head and arm. From her skirt, however, came a fried chicken smell of skin blistered by fire. Her eyes were wild and white and Tony realised the moon should be out, tonight, but wasn't. The smell of her skin reminded him of the barbecue. He put her spare arm over his left shoulder and tried not to think of drumsticks. 'Are you crying?' said BBC. 'No,' Tony said, truthfully. He didn't add; I'm sniffing. 'Help me get her in the car then, please.' 'The seatbelt doesn't work.' The man sighed and handled the woman into the seat, bending her to its right angles. Dog mingled with chicken. There was the click of a belt. Then, the man was looking at him (Tony knew it by the pause) and the writer stopped sniffing. Tony said, 'I don't think I can drive.' The man sighed again, as he walked away. Like a delating tyre, this seemed to be the way he rolled. There was a click on the Corsa's far side as the driver's door opened. The click became a slam as it closed. Tony gazed along the motorway's lights. They were fake-tan 'orange beside the ruddier fire that sprouts, from the place to palce along the route, like flames depesarately seeking the sun. BBC waves from inside he dark cab. At first Tony thinks he is flicking insects off the shoulders of the front seats, before realising he is being waved in. He hurries around the Corsa. 'Take care of her, yes?' said BBC as he palmed the gears into first, and allowed the car to crawl between two empty vehicles.

The air ws cold and compacted as dirt down deep in the land, loamy. And Tony breathed it in throughn compressed liups and grated teeth, sieving of it as much of the chillas he could. He couldn't. In his throat, the air's progress was harsh as drinkignbleach and, Tony supposed, muchg more exposure to this would be suicide. His eyes tended to agree, as dfid his mind, and he attempted to keep his gaze fixed on the centre of the corridor.

'It looks like ASlins,' said his wfe, in astuter fo shivers. Itw as the kind of thing he would have expected to saym himseld, and, so , Tony could n o disagree. Iot did. It was ahrd to look right at them. It was harder to rid the sight of them forom jhis brain. Their boeides were aklive. Despite the drapes and snaking limbs of what could only eb described of as cancer gone wild, pulsed and drained from their bodies, there chests palsied to hard drawn br4eaths, their ribscages heaved to the ebat of hewarts under duress, blood pressurised by the tentacles to pumop, to feed thenm. These weren't humans, anymore, so much as feeding sacs, food bags, hay bags. 'She's not this fucking important,' said Joanne. She was talking about his ,othert. They ade never gotten along. Oir, more to the point, Joanne had blamed her vfor all that was wrong with him. Yet, still; she continued to walk down the corridor toward jher ward, and before that, through their marraieg and, lomngt before that, down the aisle. One of the bodies ' Tony's mind havered from labelling them 'humans' ' moaned. I didn't beg for death, it didn't thrash. Instead it moned, and then gave a short fart. It se3emed al it could manage, ontop of feediong what was growing ourt of the walls as grass through aving stones. Clsoe by the cracks, it was warm but, though his body had shivered so much nit now felt inacble of doing so, anymore ' Tony did not dare approach the tentacles of what must be red and purple veined. In the dark, it was impoosible to see, but he smelt blood and the thick, slick flavour fo open wounds, and his imaginatuion supplied the rest. Now, more than ever, he could have done without his imagimation. 'I can't kill hikm. He's our da.' This ' th shout- caufght Tony off guard. He stoped and along side him so did joanne. She always there, he thought, like the tumours on those more bastards. 'You have to. Lookl, he's justg the same as those poor bleeding arsehoels out there. He's gone. He's a sack of cancer and bloods and shit.' 'NO. NO.' It came from his mother's room. Momentarily", "label": 1}

His feet inform,ed him in no uncertain terms that he woiuld regret this, amd Tolny didn't have thr stremngth top sargue. He barely hd the strength to put oen foot infronmt of the other. Especially trhe left. 'BANG' Gunshot, thoguth Tony, un bessarily., he could even smell its acriod odour. Oh no, his mind, added, I just pissed myself. St east it was warm. 'Why'd you go and do that? Why?' 'I can't shoot our Da. See sense man, I can;'t fucking shoot our fuckign Da, can I?' 'But why did you waste the bledding bullets.' 'Like you can talk. Shoioting thos epoor arseholes in the head liekm they werem't going to just keep on bleeding, keep on feeding whatever the fuck it is coming through the walls.' 'Fuck! Fuck! This is all fucked up.' Tony couldn't hjel;p but agree with the latter's sentiment. The door was approaching now. Tony didn';t feel as though he were walking toward it, buyt rather that uit was roundingon him, like the first hyena in a pacvk of doors. He had had enough of entarfnecways and existm, from Tjhis Place or That. They always led to someplace worse. He thought of frying pans an fires and fantasy lands where wraiths were real./ Without realising it, he had come to stand, now, in the door. Two heads faced each other, and a gun, Jony and Dabvey, lit by torches they both held. Tony guessed there would be ar,s and legs and trigger fingers invilevcd in there somehwree, as well,m in the dark, buyt he didn't have longt o contemplate this, before a light stabbed him in the eye,s and then Jpnnhy's light. 'Who the fuck are you, amte?' The question was as threatening ' as pointed ' as the barrel of the gun piomnted at him, and the bullet Tony imagined within it. 'It's that bloody writer.' 'Oh,' davey was still dancing, but his ricking backward and forth of a waltz had intensified to a tango his fet danced with themselves. Not only did he not seem to need a partner, but Tony doubted anybody would be able to keep up wityh his manic footwork. Nor want to. 'Do yourself a favour and fuck off mate.' GTony didn;'t know whaicjh one was speaking. He felt Joanne tighten aginst his side, rtatcheting gerself to huim, before he reakised it wass he who was doing the tightening of the screw. 'I know what's happening,' Tony said. 'What mate?' said Johhnnny. Tony recopgnised the tone of somebody at elast teyhered to reality, even if reail;ity, in the case of everything they all knew, had slipped its own morring several weeks ago. Tokny wsn't surprised he hgad asked, he could barely hear himself. he clarde his throat, swalloed, tried again. 'I know what's happening. What's coming out of the alls og the Hills. What's on the other side of the walls.' 'Do yopu? Do you, mate?' said Davey. Tony din't understand why,. He had already said he did. He continued, ploughing through it while his limsb refuised to move at all, but for rediscovering the ability to sahke, thought, this time, not with the chill. 'I know what your father is,' he said. 'And what's that?' Johnny. flat, deadly as the arc of a buyllet of the distance between tOnyt and that gun. 'he's the candy King.' I didn't see the scne through the eyes of thre first person., I was some way beyond even the third. Perhaps it was the cold, but my mind felt numb right the way down the my conscsience, and I watched as Davey shot Tony's mother cdead as though I were a thousand narrative-persons down the line. I might was well ahev not been there at all. They didn't notice me. As earlier, in the private room, when I had shown my leg, my sm,ile, I was revisted by being a woman without beauty in a man's world./ Not unattraitve, but without being particularly attractive. I supopose I will ahev to take that back. Unattractive. Yes, unattractive. I didn't attract Davey's eye as aI screeched (I would like to have called it a scream, but even to my ears it held none of a scream's intergrituy, lost itself halway though, and cebloped inyo a full blown squeal.) 'Your' Dad is the Candy King,' Tony had said. It was hard to see how this bstatement led to the brains of Tony's mother flicking far enough across the room to artex the wall in shark-fin line sof grey. I couldn't bring myself far enough out of the numb, cold state in which I found myself frozen, like a statue of a witch's enemy, to give a shit. This didn't help my memory. He was, like those statutes, transparent to me and, written right through him, as thourbggh rock, one word, a wotrd he hated to be called and, upon discovering this, I'm not too proud to admit that I call him soa s often as I'can. Prat. There was the brittle, puddle deep curving of his fingers into point, short, sharp, jolting actions of his hand, as though a card player about to keep his cards close to his chest. Caight in avuisiual,m oop,. Or like Tony Blair in a televised interview. The seem occlusion of his glottal stops. The way his tone shot down in pitch, and seemd to come from deeper in his chest, as though arabbit that had hurtl;ed into its burrow and dug and and was speaking in what the rabbvit thought was not only human tones, but manly ones, at that. His nose twitched, as he did this, and his fete made small thumping adrerenmalised motions, which all but sealed in the image fo a rabbit pretending t/o be apredator.

Prat. 'Tony,' I tried to intervene. Despite myeelf, and, oreover, despite him elrf, and the prat he was, I couldn't help but care for another human being. 'Tony'' I could see where this was going, but he never listened, especuial;ly not tyhese days' this niught, I su[pose. 'Tony, mate.' It was Johnny's turn, and tOny listened to him. Tony stopped talking. So, let me get this straight, You're saying there'll all dead. The doctor's girl- that's why she survived tehn fall from the roof- your mum, our dad. All three just sacks of cancers doing nothing but cancering on the inside?' 'Oi,' said Davey. His eyes flashed as though icons uploading. Dear Davey, I thinkl. It takwe shim quite a while to catch up but when he dioes it's like catchogn MRSA. There's very little you can do about it. 'So you'r esayign, et me get this stariught mate,' he didn't soun dliek he meant either, about getting it straight or Tony ebing his mate. 'You're sayind we should eave our Dad, oru Dad who raised all on his bloody own, to freeze to death up hgere in the dark, delicate condition he's in and all, because he's onlya sack of shit.' The Prat was showing now. I can almost here the crack of Tony breakinh apart,. I imagination rock, once more. My mind sleep walks though the steps. So, this is hgow e get to Davey placing the gun against the forehead of Tny's mther. It is pallid and, even in the flat light cast by the torch in Davey's pother hand, you kniow it's sweaty. There's a smell of urea in here, hwoever. Maybe the image is suggested. 'You won't mind if I do this then.' If angels can dancve on pij nhead, Daveuy seemed as able to rtun, to pirhoutte, ona s small a space. He pulled the trigger and Yonyw ent to floor and jher brains went to the wall. Tony didn't get the chance to say 'no'. His knees crack as though broken, though my ears are still mrining from t beh shot, and maybe the cracking I hear is merely the echo of asoun dthat shouldn't exist. The hospital itself, the doorway, the cooridors festooned with toumousr, seem tio draw in, like disapproving mouths, in shock. 'jesus.' IU can'y see Johnny's face because his tproch light is a a lighthouses on the wall that has recently beco,ke liwuid, but I can tell his cheeks would be red as though slapped, his face recdfeing on his shoulders as though punched. 'Jesus,' the word comes again. I can't hel;p- but notice that the heart monitor beside her bed doesn't respond at all, but continues with its pegamtic, rthythmic beeping, like a lorry backing over a puppy. It must be broken. Mty mind knows how ot feels, I think./ Davey's torch light is a spot on Tony';s face, the featres of which writhe like a vampire's if theer were still a sun to disintrigrate uncder. Tehn vapires, I reckon, must be having a partuy fo time, right now. All that blood. I remember the wall, and the shark fins of grey mater. Cirvcling. The devil o nTony's forehead does not stare with as much malignancy as his eyes. They haven't giottewn around to crying, not yet. The barrel of Davey's gun is pointed at thye writer but I think he will rise, nonetheless. H eapears to try but his legs won't support, and Tony sprawls on his chest, his face and forehead atrwictsed upward t stare at his mother's killer. The wrinkling of the forehead shortens the devl, making it appear patheticall small. Prat, I think, again. I know it isn't right, but I cabn't help it. Just look at him, I think,a d I look away, there is s hirt in his eyes that was dragging my in, making me care. And I can't. the world is shovering, it's so cold. I relaise I am moving sideto side, like a child who needs the toilet,a dn that this is because In am freezing. Humanity is dying. Though Tony is on eof the last men alive, it seems I cannot care for him. Te rest is a somnabolic walz. Johnny and Davey won't leave their father or the little girl here, and make tOny, at gunpimt, lift the girl;, as they carry their father, out of the ward. They have a plan, to sela them all in theares on floor five. To limit power input to that level. The thetres are hermetic, their own vemtiollation, their own heating, and just so for emergencies such as this. Wrll, not the sun turning off, but I got Johnhyt';s point.

So, we used the staircase.

Even when the heliscopters is sawn from the roof byt eh storm and falls against the windows, on this side, white and wet and clammy looking, there, shattering the glass, as the belly of a chained fish at market, hung there on some unseen shackle, and its white belly fat, lambent with eggs, or the feeling that mankinds inventions are being repealed. Flight then medicine then food then, eventuallu, when all the fuel in the Hills has riun out, fire. We are ging the wsay fo the dinousaurs. We continue up the strairs. It wasn't onlythe tattroo that was on his face but all the rest of Tony, too. His mind was on the part of him one inch above where it should reside. His freatures worked, his cheeks bunched, his mouth tightened into the small hole fo a small dog doing its best not to defacte. His forehead may have been red, as was the rest of his skin,m but if Tony could put his kind to anywhere deeper. Bhe would have known theat the red tide swilled down deep into his past. He felt, now, as he had for years in his marrauge, important. He felt now as he had as a child , unable to gthink fo aretort to his step-father. But he wasn';t to know this, not when all of his thoughts rested on killing Davey, shhoting him in the face as Daveyh had his mother, and all of the memories were repressed. H esat, even, in the theatre, pressed down beneath a sink, face hidden as that of a small child beneath a table in a classroom, refusing to be coaxed out, not that anybody was doing any coaxing. All they did was watching, both of Johnny's eys on him, and Davey's ewhen they weren't bouncing about the room to the rhythm of his jostling heels, and the eye at the end of the barrel of the gun Johnny held. That eye, thjough blank, was justa s watchfgul, as all the rest of them, and Tony didn't need to think to imagine the readiness of the bullet within. It glinted in his red-misted mind like the joke in Davey's eye,w ehne they had arrived at the surgery theatre, and he had said, 'Why dso sad, little Tony? Want your mummy?' And Tony hadn't heard Johnny when he'd said, '|Enough' because his attentiojn had risen with his blood to his skina dn all he could ehar was the sound of Davey choking beneath his fingers. Now, though ti went usn een, it could be sensed that the group's hearingw as as watchful as their eyes ' filled to the brim with each sound in their hearing. In the distance could be ehard screaming. Given the hermetic nature fo the theatre (sealed bar the mesh of the ventilation shaft and the hot aior that sieved Vadarosh through it) that distance may not have been greater than a few doors. It was closing and had been ever since the lights had varied, as though a dimmer switch between the fingers fo a six year old. 'Oh Ah Cantona.' It was Johnny's turn to blush. 'Oh Ah Cantona.' There was no gloating in the tone of the chant, btu defiance, low and dirgeful,. The sound of human words a s deathj closed in. 'Oh Ah Cantona.' By the spound of the scream ing outside the thetere; it would not be their deaths. There were three other men in the room (Tony did not know their names and didn't care to, finding it diffilcult to acrwe for anything but brains cshaped lilke shark fins) and two women. The women regarded him as if he were a diseased ravbit. He realisded, on some ignored lebvel, that the furs he wore were beginning to curdle into the smell fo something small and dead and hidden beneath the floorboards. YTony was used to the loks of the women. Not for the first time simnce his mother's death, and for a countless time in their relatriionship,m his wife was regarding him the same way. 'Oh Ah Canyona. Oh Ah Cantona.' They swelled with the screaming, catching the emotuion, it seemd, u ntil they nearly eclipsed the sound of its variacve into human words, into meaning, hoarse and choked and almost forgotten to the tongue, by ist sound, of the speajker. 'Plkeasr. I can hear you in there. Please let me in.there's something in the walls.' The door to the theatre was locked. Sn up to date contrivance, along witht ethe second back up boiler, according tot eh men. Tomny considered killi ng them with acid. 'Oh Ah Cantona.' Mouth to mouth the baton of the chant was passed, on eacxh round growing in volume, trying, almost, to fill theroom, so that no other sound could '.shoe in. It didn't work. 'Please. Please. I domn't want to end up like the others.' Scarbbling. The rabbit furs on Tony's limbs were abruptly itchy. He didn't move to scratch it. The soudnof something wet, as a slug must sound to a leaf.

{"text": "door, which glowed, x-rayish. 'Oh'.' The chant failed, sounding at its demise like an innuendo, a Kennth Grammar. It would have made Tony smiule, if his face wasn't so fixed in hatred, and the brain behind it in fear. 'Shit,' someone said. Itw as one of the unnamed males. It didn't matter, Tony wouldn't jhave known who it was, even if it had been him. All he could notice, now, ws the sound of wetness and the screaming beyond the door. The woman in the hanger in alien, his brain offered. As the first thing he had managed to think in some time, it wasn';t comforting. Whatever the wetness was, it inside the woman on the other side of the door. 'You have rot open it'' a woman in thew theatre managed, before her voice was interrupted by the vomit that cam eup with it. The scrraming turned to squeking, as if the woman was being pulled away from thedoor and to the wall on the opposite side of the xcorridor. No as if about it, Tony thought. After about the time it would take someone to die underwater, no matter how big a whoop of air they had taken, the lights above the group jutted and returenmd, glaring, too honest for Tony's nerves. He looked at a floor tile,a dn away from FDavey for the first time since he had sat here, beneath the sink. 'Whyw as it so hot?' A woman asked. 'Haints.' Said Johnny, a word like a gulp but backwards, justa sliquid with fear, but out of him. ;What?' Tony said. He hadn;r realised he needed to speak, until he was unable to stop himself. 'Hot springs.' Said Johnny. 'What?' Tony repeated, alolowing all of the sarcasm, of his chodlhood, of his marriage, to well up. It had ever been his weapon, when everuybody welse was always holding the gun. 'Some writer you are,' sad Jonny. 'Try readfing so books yourself. Haven't you ever read To Kill a Mickingbird. It's th sign fo aghost,a s pirirt from someplace else. The ehat,. Haints. Hot springs.' 'Not soemthign in the walls. Soemthing beyond the walls.' Said Davey. If Tonmy ddin';t haet him so much he would have agreed. 'We shoukd opne the door,' said a woman. Marj, or so Tony thought. The ice of fear had chilled the red mist in his blood. She was older than tenother, red haired with roots of white that grew outwards as the snow mounted about the Hills. No one agreed but Johnny was walking to the oor. He pressed a green button at its right and proper it with his left foot. He leaned out. He raised his gun and his finger moved on its trigger, bhut not inward, toward himself, but in twitching caresses, as though he wanted to love the gun but could do no more tham pretend. 'It's another one.' Tony didn't have t rose. His imagimnation was working fine now. H ehad seen them before, after all. The writhing tumours multiplying like insecst beath the skin. The tentacles sunk into her orificies, into her mouth stopping her screams , but the screames were still there, all too visible in her wide, white, rolling eyes. Another foodsac fpor the cancer in the walls. 'Shut the door.' Said Joanne. 'Please.' 'Shuit the door.' Said Tony, unable to help repeating her. 'Please.' Johnny ignired him his finger on the trigger, but not still. 'Donm't mate. It6's a waste of bullets, you know it.' He did, it appeared, after a moment, because he tuned, let the door shut and went and sat on the table in the centre of the room, forehead an dcheeks as pallid someone whose time of death had been called hoiusr before. [smell alike a small animal had crawled in here amd died and by the look of his clkothes, and the feral snarl of his vfeatures, that animal was him ] 'Get some bloody clothes on,' said Davey. He threw jeans and a hoodie down beside Tony. Tony stared at them, and the frill of red football shirt the raw bacon in their sandwich, and to his own furs. Despite the shirt's colour, the clothes he had on were bloodier. He gazed at Davey through the hot-air-on-tarmac waver of not understanding. 'Jesus,'; said Davey. 'You smell loike your wearing a tom Tom.' Tony couldn't bear to think of himself as less intelligent than the man before him, but he ws just cleever enough to know he was. His head ached, filling with sludgy doubt. Now he knew why itw as called 'thick'. Eureka, he thougtg, I',m stupid. As far as epihenies went, this left him underwhelemed. Davey gestured with a the barrel of the gun, a shorter action than pointing, but more pointed, and Tony put on the apparel, fitting the furs both under and over the jeans and hoodie, for insulation. Gradually, he felt heat return to his limbs and , with it, a sense of his own humanity. He stood, clipping the edge fo te sink with the back fo his scalp, swore and stuttered forward with his fett, staring at his hand. Itw as unbloodied, which made a change, these days. 'Come on Miss Confidentaillity, stop being a klutz and come with us.' The men were armed with rifles and handguns, and carreid jerry cans in their spare hands. 'Door' said Johnny. The lader of the line fo five pressed the green button, and a lock deep in the wall c,licked. (Tiony had, since the emergence of the tumours, come to thinking of the walls as having guts,a nd organs, an dof staring at him.) The door opend and they left the theatre, the woman kissing each in turn but for Tony. Joanne didn;'t kiss him. She had moved,a s Johnny stroe passed, a sthough to embrace him, but had drawn away.

If he didn't want to kil him. The men before him kept their gins at eye level, moving them as they moved their heads, in extension, as if they had played too many computer gameds, Call of Duty, Operation Desert, The War on Cancer. The man at the back of the line, behin d Tony, vlipped his lame heel and Tony staggered. Ten,na didn't apologise and tony felt the phrase 'Surovval of the Fittest' reel through his head. He realised Death wasn't an Ewual Access building. The disabled could just skip right in. They hadn't left him in the operation theatre, hwoever, probably because they thought he might, maybe, have the strength to kill one fo the woman. Well that was soemthign at least. Tony took this as a voyte of confidence. They wer going down the strairs, the resy fo the line straightforwardly, Tony crabbing sideways. For the first time, the red of a football strip suited him. Down, down intot eh dark, liena bucket into the well in Moria. Tony could have jheard thew drums, if his breathing was not too loud in his ears. Before him, the light from their tortches, masking taped to their guns, swere shotting stars of yellow in the pitch. It would have been quite the display if Tony's terror had allowed him to concentrate. As it ws, couldn't help but wait for what Johny had termed the Hot Spirngs, and for the cnacer from the Other Place to 'lan in and take him. M<aybe, he reckone,d that's why they had brought him along on this particular picnic. A honey trap for the wasps. They were going to the generators, to siphon of what remained in the main, and the first backup, for twhat the theatre;s used, the second. It would buyt them time, Johnnny had said. For what, Tony had wonederde but dared not say, a longer death? The door to the basement floor tutted as it swung to and fro, seeming unable to pick which way it wanted to be, open or closed. Nside the remaining working generator could be heard, rattling, ti mechanical insnnards huyrtling about inside its shell like a heart having an attack. 'Please don't fuckign break,' someone could be heard to say, By the sound of their strung out, whining syyleables, they might as well have been talking about their mind. 'Please.' 'Right lads,' said johnhy, his voice hardca s obsidian in the dark. You could 'lan on it. You could believe it had the stretgth for them all to start again. Just them , despite everything that had come before, if Tony ahd been an ape, he would have worshipped before it. 'Let's get at it.' The atmosphere in the basement had all the ambience of an alleyway beside a night club, and more death than an alley could hold. The echoes of the last generator's clanking rebounded from the walls as though the bricks would rather crush to roolom out of existence. The fleeting, strobing of flashlights and the electrical neonish glow from the generator and the wures that had been restrung to supply the operation theatres made the space insulubrius. Like detritus, deathw a sunderfoot, and so,mehwat beforshin. This seemd to be where all the rats in hosipital had come tod ie, as though the pied piper were the boiler and its dyspectic clanging the kind of pipe tune rodents would like. 'Ra\\ts,' said Davey. Somehow he invested the words with the bile he carried in his nomrla vocabuloary, with the vehemence of an ;arsehole', the stridence of a 'prick' the bristle of a 'cunt'. Benath his furs and furr-hidden trainers, Tony felt the body of a rat pop, putrificence finding its way to his heel in a line. He was glad of Dave, tne, for the first time. 'Jesus,' said Irwin. Johnny ha dwalked over the rats that'sappeared to have scurried down here, to the last accessible heat in the building, and were compacted up the edges of the generator, to knee height. As Johnny had walked, the chittantous sound of bones and other craetues could be heard, cracking unseen in the morass. Tony could only guers that where the rats went, the cockroaches had followed. 'They'll still be some alive under theer,' said Solksaer. 'I saw something move,' said Irwin. An explosion, squealaling and squeaewking and amound of whatw as now the carept to this room,. A shaggier pile than Tony ahd ever hoepd to feel underfoot, shifted, lurched. 'Leave it,'s shouted Johnny. 'They'll be happy enough eating each other. Just don't put your toes in their mouth. God knows what nasty diesaes they have.' 'Christ,' said Irwin. 'I'm more worr4id about them putting their mouth ion my toes!' 'Come on,' said Johnny. He as bent, crouched, now, jerry can in hand, beside the generator thatw as not on. Swaying on the covering of rat, In the alleyway light, as he worked with his mouth at ten fuel pipe that led to it, he had the look of a drunken woman whow as giving away more of herself tha she hasd planned, at the end of along nght. The night was nothing, thought tony, if not long. They were lal giving away more of themselves stha thet ha d to give. Johnny gagged as ten oil came up, and spitting and gagging into himself, he managed between spits to hiss. 'get it in the bloody cans.' By the lack of splatter on fur, he didn't vomit, and Tony had an image of the man they called Cantona as a wall befor a rising see, grey and virulent and storming, ut he simply wouldn't let it in.

In their corner was Irwin, towering over him but slipping on the spine fo a rat. He ahd been atsked with looking after him, stick close, Tony could imagine Jonny saying, he's a slippery one that stuck up twat, slippery as a rat. Irwin was close to falling, his rifle was no longer pointed at Tony back, but had gone sideways, a stick to keep him standing. Irwin had given up on the idea of walking, it seemd. Tony's left leg was wrapeped in denim and fur, a starched hook. He extended it toward the giant. Ftom stage left. Exeunt Irwin. The generator mewled as it palsied, then mumbled, then hissed. As the lights along its diodes twinkled like those in a punched cornea, a heat rose from the walls. The rats underfoot shiofted, making for the brickwork. At the edges of the carpet, they could be heard squeling, as soemthignint he brick made, also, for them. Still the rodents, alive in the ehat of their decaying brethren, pushed toward the warmth. Irwin staggered. 'There's soemthign in the alls,' said Davey. 'It's beyond the alls.'

'Hold fire,' shouted Johnny. His voice had rsen and fallen to Tony's eharing, as he dashed intot he stairwell and left and up and left and uop and left and up. His left leg was torque that skowed him, threatened to flip him, but he swuing the leg fervously. The doors below opened as Tony made the second floor. 'I'm get you you bastard.' Johnny. By the sound s of it, his lips had burst apart, and hung, like his sanity, gaping. 'You bastard.' He took the steps two at a time. There were silhouttes in the wall. Got to get to the Other Place. Got To.Got To. Got To. The thoghst acme quicker than the steps. Johnny was catching, and would soon catch him. Through the dsoors to the third floor. YTony would have jumped at the sight fo the cat hising and running across his front foot, but he could spare the momentum. Yorkshire cat, his mind managed. Good sign. Silhouttes were in the walls; of trees and children and conjoined bodies. The Other Place was near, as near as it was goiugn to be, but Tony needed the lifts,. But he wsn't going to make them. And Johnny was going to get him. Got To. Instead, hwoever, of getting away, he got to coughing, bent into himself, into his arm and his hand, and hacking thick metallic liquid into his pakm. In the red light from the all it looked like blood. Johnny exploded into the back of him, turning him like a terminator against the nearest wall. Tony could hear soemthign in it, a am liquid, monstrous, tentacled life form that knew human flesh all to well, because that was where it had come form an dwhat it fed on, and then felt the warm rush ' a spine rtinglign relief- of Hot Spring up his heels, the backs of his knees, his buttocks and back. The panting of te predator, he thought. Johnny was in his face, Johnny' spown seemd to consist of several parts, techntonic plates of snarling, all msimashed one against eh other, everuthign grinding, and nothijnbg moir' so than his teeth, and screaming about killing him, perhaps, but Tony couldn't hear because he he was slamming him against eh all and the hearing and the breath and the sight was being knocking out of him, slammin g, S;lamming Not slamming. They were falling through. Wet, tumourous fingertips slicked across his forehead ' he saqw them snap at Johnnys right cheek, amd miss, but for a line gruel like that which agd come out of the stepped upon rat- anf they were insunlight. Flash, as quick as a camera, or that of a hydrogen bomb,a ndf then shadow, staring up at the undergrowth and, more pertinately, Johnny's snarling face, and, closer even, his hands, which YTlony could feel about his throat, thrortling. 'Stopm,' eh treid to say, 'stop' look. But his eyes did enough, as far as he could see, because Johnny did so, and stopped strangling him. The man they called cantona flopped back, fish like at the end of its struggles and stared up at a canoipy that extened so fdar upwoard, it might as well have been a new sky. Tomny hacked. Coughed. 'You didn'tm' he tried.' He rpeated the actoosn that had gone before. Smelt blood on his chin. 'You didn't breath in the sunshine did you?' he asked. Johnny tunrdd to look at him. His body and face were near, closer now hat his chin was tunred, and there was vulnerability in his eyes, as though they had been intimate in ways other than trying to kill one another. Lookignat him, staring into Tony's eyes, Johnny began to laugh, and he to laugh as he looked away, and didn't stop laughing until he heardc what Tony ehardc some time before. The sound fo screaming. [reach the lift] [that ain't hikm ' that's a abarrel. You're ahvinga laugh.] There qwas something missing. Itw as right under his nose", "label": 1}

No vapour rose from his mouth. Instead, all of the world benmeath tehb canopy was a miasma. He felt, if anything, his greathne should provoke bubbles. The heat was a drowning, the forest a bath in which he was emerged head to toe, and not from the chin,m but to the scalp. He almost couldn't breatje,a nd had to call time on his liuaghin. Johnny seemd to sober at much the sam ertime, It took sioen effort to push air against this oppressive heat. And., fo course, as ever there was these days (and it had been some time since Tony had been able to use that idouim, some time since it had been anything but night) . Johnny wa sup before he was, facing the screams. They had a particular pitch, ridsing then rising before continuing to rising. There was no eam to them, only the scree 'scree scree scree' And Tony became convoicneced they were, in fact, squeling. In the earshot of such insanity and pain, particulars became important to him, he didn't know why. They had been ever since the sun went out. They were walking. Tony hyad increased his pace, not to meet Johnny's, not to be in simatico, but because both were striding at the edge of their gaits, and Tony on the iother side of his strides dfeghe ' continuall7y trippin g, sty=umbling, then hurrying once more. They quick setpepd to the beat of the scree's. The watery, wavering nature of the air didn't impede them. It dragged them forward and before long they wree aware, somewhere in their knees and hips, that tyehn land was descening as though toward a drain, or a plughole. They were being washed down with it. To the sewer, thgouht Tony, like two more rats. Ahead, where darkness should be, there was light, It was a wound in the forest, the sunshine as bight as fresh blood from a gouge, and beating in a kind of visual coronary. Ton shielded his eyes from above, as if about to face a Giorgon. 'Stop,' he said. Itw as hard to say this ' against eh scree's and the press of the atmospjhere- but harder to act it. Slowly, he did. 'Stop,' he added, and, at ekeast, Johnny slowed. 'Don't go intot eh light. I did once' and' Don't go into the light.' Breathign was rapid but heavy as bouldetrs in a stream. There ws soemthign else. He was reluctant to discuss the tumours nestled like cuckoos in his lungs. Johnny stared at him,. His eyes were green as a football field, after it had cut up , maybe used for rugnby. There had been heavy passage therin, wear and the coccasional tear, far bck in his childhood. He nodded, and they heard the scree-ing once more,a dn went to ground. Scampering forward on aching haunches, Tonya nd Johnny closed on the clearing, hiding nbehidn trees at its edge. There were no bishes. The clearing ahad been burnt out, as a bug at the enmd of a magnifying glass, and there hadm't been buishes here, Tony supoosed, for eons, or forever. Insteda, broken blackened, lizard scaled trees leaned as though brun victims on there way to dying. In the centre fo the hotspot, of the smudge mark of ash, were two black ncloths. The scree-ing had stopped. The black cutouts of ' yes, it was silk, thought Ton y, had the shape, from the side, of two segmenst fo a plug, or wedges in trivial pursuit, yoru specialist subject; torture. Cauhht like scarsp of meat too swollen to go down the drain was the six fo s=tumours, what ws left of the two of tumours (a new one of tumour), a golden carrauge and, on it, the Candy King. The Cnady Kingw as smoking, a cigarrtess (Tony guessedl; Superking) jammed to a rent hole that was his mouth. The Candy Kign, now that he saw him, was a playing card but tall as an ogre. Visible above the curve fo golden handrail on the golden side fo the golden carriage, the top half, crowned, was the face of Johnny's father on ermine ruff. Puff, suck 'The covers, please two.' Said the king, staring at the cigareete reflectively. The card, at its edegs (two florets of blobs that must signofy tumours, and a k, which dribbled a tear of blood from the kick pof the 'k') oscillated to the passing of a force om the other side, not the wind, but something tentacle and slow moving, but when the King turned to view his footmans progress to the cutoputs of silk, thew reverse of the card was but the Candy King again, in exactly the same pose, smoking. The half of the two tumours rested a hand on one cloth and pulled. The other cloth sobbed, once, as it did this, twitching. The first pull revealed a rose that had once been pink. Now it ewas black nearly all the ay down. In the sunlight it began, for a umpteetnth time,m Tony supoosed, to shrivel and smoke. He thought he caughta glimpse of pink, dep in its folds, curled in the foetal curling up of the petals. Maybe. Maybe he didn't. The Cnady King cackled then began to cough. Blood dribbled out of his line drawing mouth. Puff, suck, cough, bleed. The footman, his heavy cloak causing sweat to rub both his necks into rawm, asddles ores of red, walked to the other cloth, and plucked it up, as a magician miught reveal a dove, instead fo a cooked pigeon. This was the wrong way round howevert. Whatever was under the cloth was more than overdsone. A crisp would have thought it burnt.

Insteda, whatever force worked on it, propelled it, like the lady across the lake, the tumour across the skin. 'Cancer,m' said the Casndy Kimng and his Sabah half nodded in agreement. 'When we come thoruhg tot eh other place, tjhey'll be barely any human s ledt and those that are we will feed on.' Scree scree scree. The piglet dribbedl some fo his fat, bubblimng, onto the forest floor, where it further flamed a black l;eaf. 'Cancer,' said the Candy King. 'Is the next bohg thing. The humans haven't worked it out, not yet,. But we are the next step in the evolutionarey process. The fittest. The step up. Where humans end, we will take over.' Yony crawled around astump, over to Johnny. Johhnnny wasn't moving, nit even his eyes, they stayed flata dn heavy on the ;pig as two green corpses. 'Johnny,' whispered Tony. He had to do so again,l and a little louder, and the six tumours turned in its harness, but couldn't twist away from the carriage. 'Johnny.' Johnny looked at him. 'You were smoking.' 'Cuyt some flesh from the pig then,' saiud tynje Candy King, int eh background to Tony's whispers. 'He looks done just how I like it.' Johnny was starinmg blankly again. His minds off witht eh dandy lions, thought Tony, and the fashionalble leopards. La, la, la. Tony's own midnm knew how it felt, but he kept the whisper going, soothing to himas the rustle of a brook. 'Yiou were smoking and you had a lighter, this palce is fit to go up. I can't leave him here,. Cooking in that sun. We have to burn this place o0ut. I know it will kill thepig, but it will bbe quicker.' 'Out of the frying pan and into the fire,' mouthed Johnny. 'Yes,' said Tony. 'But the fire is quickert. It will get things done.'

Instead, dn backed away. Eating, the Candy King yhad returned to his carriage. There, beyod ht esmoek nthat now rose from the bark before Tony,. He could be seen to bend, and solictisously, to pick up something, to stroke. As the smoke forked in an updraft of heat, Tony saw it was a cat. In the moment it took the Candy King to look up and see him ' and Johnny- he saw that it was the Yorskhire Cat, and that the Yorkshgire cat was smiling. 'here's my loittle ace in the hole,' said the Candy King. It seemd a term fot eh felin, but the Candy Kign was looking at himas he said it. Tony didn't loomback, as he said 'run.' By the sound sof it, nor did Johnny.

Am I?.. Am I?..' As with most things these days, Tony was unsure, both of the answer and the question. It would be a while before he stopped thinking in terms of days. 'You should have told me before.' This is vague, unlike the, Hunnnnh hunnnnnu hunh inside my head. 'I would have gone back for turd.' The last word may not have been turd.

Ahead, the chain of lights was broken. One lamppost hadn't gone on, or had given out, and the darkness, there, pressed in. the Corsa drove into the black. Tey passeda wreccked Mercedes, lit sub-marinally by their headlights. BBC slowed rto first gear and Tony peered in at the diodes on the dashboards, reds and greens and washed out blues. Abruptly, a head reered against the side-window. She was bleeding ' somehow from somewhere ' tpny could tell by the streaks of liquid. He couldn't see its hue. Gorgom, her hair wroithed as she screamed. Blonde, he thought, from kits waviness. He couldn't hear her,a nd felt unable to speak, at least until they had passed back into the radii of lights, and BBC had accelerated to third. 'Stop,' said Tony. BBC didn't hear, or didn't do so. 'Stop,' said Tony. And, 'We have to go back to that black Mercedes.There's a woman trapped inside. She's hurt.' 'B;ack Mercedes.' There';s a pause. tony gains the impression its not from recalling, but from BBC holding himself back. All there is is breathing and Tony winders if BBC is having an asthma attack. the wonder has no place in the new dark, and us fleeting. 'All the way back there? In the pitch black?' pause. breathe. breathe. 'We can;'t just turnm around on the motorway.' Tony sinks back into the back seat.the breathing is becoming impressive, seemingly inflating nthe car. 'We can';t just turn around. there are cars behind us'' He lapses into breathing. Tony wished he would stop. I wake with my cheek pressed against bristling, scratchy carpet, thinking 'hair of the dog' and wondering if I am drunk. The rough burrow of my throat lets me know I haven't been drinking. I'm in the boot but it smells different. I feel the wheels turning beneath me. I hear Tony say, 'The radio.' As with much of what he says, it sounds like repetition. He's a writer, everything is an edit, I think, not uncharitably. He used to be funny. 'Let me out,' I whisper. I raise my hand and banged at what must have been his seat. It wasn't really a bang, but a vague, wafting whap. The hand, seen in the slashes of orange motorway light from above, is strange to me, an albatross chick at the end of my arm. Awkward and uncertain and failing to learn to fly, it falls to the boot-floor. It manages another attempt at flight, a clipped hit of the upholstery, then falls again. Once more. Fall. My consciousness is dragged down with it. 'Yeah, the Hills,' the man named Nige' is saying. 'It's closest. Research hospital. Cancer, like. But it's the closest. Yeah.' He had a face that was as much plasters as skin, giving him a cyborg complexion, and not one that could be taken for human. Tony thinks, there shouldn't be stars, it should be twilight. What would they call it now the light had been taken away. Twi? The cab spelt of blood as something bitter, Tony hoped it wasn't the little girls brains. 'Could you put the radio on?' said tony. The man at his side twitched, but didn't turn to look. His legs were parted, jutting, as young men do on the bus, to discourage fellow passengers. Tjis was supposed to be Tony's car, despite the fact that he didn't drive, despite the fact that it wasn't, and he resented it, but then he resented most things.. He thought, maybe, he follow his wife's instructions and start the journal. Not very self aware, for a writer, she said, when he was listening. On buses in the morning, he would resent the driver stopping. He longed to leave commuters stranded in the rain, trying to huddle below too-short shelters. BBC had stopped twice more to pick up survivors. Tony hated being crowded. As an 'immensely talented' writer he liked to set himself apart, which was difficult when pressed up against the muscular thigh of man named Nige'. (As if Nigel wasn't bad enough.) Tony's leg cramps, and he moves it, and Nige's muscles follow, filling the space. Tony is as much in the gap beside the door as on the seat. Tony minds. 'Uhm,' Tony clears his throat, tasting adrenaline. 'Please could you turn the radio on. It's my bloody car you know.' The wheel arch is an imposition in his back, his hip. The man in the passenger seat turns. His face was staely, bearded, clipped, straight-nosed. His legs were long, feet eaten by the footwell before him. 'Sorry, mate?' he said. 'The radio?' Tony said. He sounded sorry, to his own ears. 'Keep her awake,' said BBC. His eyes glittered in the rear view mirror, dirty as iron ore (and orange under the lights), shot through with hardness.

Tony nodded, unable to do anhthign but agree, throat too hoarse from smoke and running through it, and pushing through his fear, to manage more than an 'aye,' which sounded like a lie, in his spouthern accent.

Sn image from a amovie ' abyss- flooded Tion's mind. Of getting used to breathing water. Let it in. He thought, it wqa sequally cold.

Frtom the light, hung dranw and quarted by the wood as it was, that came from thourhg the den and then then rent in their realoity, Tony thought he could. A laqueer as though someone had paintakeingly painetd varnish on the floor, until it made short back fins of silvery treflection. 'Yeah,' he hissed. His luings knew all about painstakingly. He stopped coughing, started agi, the stopped as he felt blood in his mouth. He swlalowd,d glancing at Johnny as the latter bent to touch the floor. His fingers came up with a jelly-thick slime.

'And stay off the thbrid floor.' Johnny nodded. The motion was a bobbing of shadows on the corridor wall that reminded Tony so alittle girl ruynning between the railway slats of a fsilhoputte forest. He had been there and, therefore, she had been there, and therefore, he had walteched her being eaten by the Candy King. It followed, anmd it wouldn't be long, Tony knew, before th King found away through, a followed hi, sure as logic. Sure, eh thought, and stumbled away. ['Sorry about what David did.'

Tony did nothing more than look back, his lips falling apart, and kept doing so as Johnny turend and moved, starin g at air as he sucked it through his lips. Shut the door, he thought, absent as the memory of a lost parent, you're letting out all the heat.] The MRI in the adjoining room gave a lull hum through the wall, sounding for all the world like life mulling over how to torute Tony, now. It didn't take loing. 'She's full of it,' said Johnny. Like mother like son, thought Tony,. Itw as the kind of thing people would normally say about him., and by people he meant his wife, and by normally; all the time, give or take a 'you're fucking' and 'arsehole.' She was. The scanner, the way it was set, showed his mother in outline and orange through and through, like a gingerbread woman. The Candy King had caught her. There was not a spot of flesh left, all of it overridden, from one to another,w ith tumour, tumensecnet, filled like a potato with, thought Tony, potato. She was cancer, now, like the littler girl that ahd fallen from the roof. Aliev, nit because she fought tooth and nail, but alive because she had been taken over, right down to her toes, to the end of her fingers. He remmebred reading Misery, as a teenager in hus bedroom, around the time she had told him that the tissues he was using were better being binnede, and not shoved in the niches of his bed. He recalled Annie Wiklkes, how Paul had th8ight he could push a digit into her nostril, and he would encounter the doughy, but stolid, touch of something hidden, an unending Annie ness that went from one side to the other. And alien Solidity. His mother had been that way to Tony. Somehow, always, or at elast she had remarried, an opaqueness that caqme with step parents and a love divided, as though, at the age of eight she had turned from the light and he would find it hard to see through her, from then onwards, until noiw, when he could see everything, from one end of the skin to the othe, and still saw nothing but the same. 'Youw ere right,' said Johnny. 'About the Candy King. ASbotu my dad. About your mUm.' He paused.

In fact, since the nightmare of finding myself;f in Tony;s subconsuis, I had beguin to feel like I was slipping away, fading into a figment of somebody wlese,s dream, and not adream of any of these people.

Theer wass only so may times blanked stare could be given before it was better to stare at the floor. ASfter a while, even the therapy devise of rubbing my hand against the back of my forearms became little sue, even the pretending that somebody else was comforting me, as a man, I guessed, sat on his hand to make it numb and then masturabeted, caesed to raise even the goosebumps of p;lease that it did at first.

They would have looked, If' I'd been in the mood to notice, like slates woiped clean by what he had seen. To an extent, this was unsurpirisng. Tony was stood behind him, the tattoo on his head giving him the impression of being a devil on the the taller man's shoulder. I knew from experience that Tiony had the tendency to opeb one's eyes to what people were really like,m beneath all thlos esoiuterhn, bloody-minded manners.] Irwin and Davey simultaneously: Where have you been?

[he holds his brother, again, who doesn't push him away, but who's arm remain limpo at Johnny's hips, like a dill and his ventriloquist. Davey's face is setting, as he stares at Tony, stiffening. The liquid in his eyes laquers.] I'm sorry, bro. I'm, sorry, pal. Irwin: What are we going to do? [he doesn't sound so much like a broken record, as just broken.] Johnny: We need help. [Johnny rubs his brothers back. The rubbing elicits nothing, not even a cough,.] We need to call the authorities. We need to call for help. [Davey breaks away, wooden faced, splinter glare.] DFavey; Call the cops, you mean. [Johnny steps awa, his cheeks red, and downcast, and to the side, as though recently slapped.} 'Yeah,' Johnny sighs more than says. 'We need to call the cops.' [a dream in somebody else's head. Teeth on edge from the cold, but now, also because soemthingbetween them changed, they were on the precipice of it; standing on a ice flow as it sepearated.] The black out dark, the enervating chill, the fatigue that holed him both above and below the aistline, and in his limbs, besides, all these things dragged at Tony. Then btherew as the well of terror in hgis brain, overflowing, black, toxic; if the rest of hid body felt weeak, this was where all the atwers had gone. His head was a ripe melon, aching across its circumference. He foolowed the others, I n single file, each hunched the same, as though there shoulders retreated from th world. It had asixteen bit quality ' This World- as though an old computer game, a Doom, the orginal. Reality was not what itw as supposed to be, that weas sure, and Tony was finding it hard to connect. Inside, he toiled", "label": 1}
{"text": "to. His heart beat in frantic, snatching poumps, as though it could reach out through his rib cage and grasp the hospital by its collar; it's tiles, its sleeper-dull, slatted, off lightbulbs, even its walls. But his heart was alone. Every other part fo Tony felt he was walking thorugh a computer game, and like Doom, things waited beyond the wall,s for a misstep, perhaps, and like Doom he knew his eyes were jarring side to side, paranoid,a nd with everyu right to be. Unluike Doom, there was no gun before his eyes. The others in the line- Irwin, Solsjaer, Cantona, Scolesy- held them. taped to their arrels were torches, to sthat everythjinfg the spots (sometime circles, sometime ovals, cometime broken like bat-sugnals) touched seemed a target, an enemy. The torch-lights seemd as jump as Tony's eyes felt. About this, Tony couldn't help but think, they were right. They went down steps, down corridors, and down to the front, automatic doors. Unlike his eyes, these weren't doing any sliding, but reverbaeratde to the wind on the other side, as though a '[metal sheet] in '. [band name]. The sound boomed through the foyer, the vibration s of which seemd to have knoicked over most of the green. Plastic chairs, and one woman, who had bled from one nostril enough to cover several metres of carpet, up to the recition desk. The rectionist nbeyodn it had collapsed onto the counter, as though in despair at the unreal NHS targets set by the government. In her hand was empty bottle, brownm plastic a pond like filter to her fingers on the other side, making them appear to be floating, whiole the rest of her, the skin of her cheeks, her hair ina matted pool, had all sunk. And urine, thought Tony sniffing, below her high legged seat. He caught a glimpse of Joanne to his right. She ws aas white as those fingers,a nd as thin, and with the lack of light (bar the spots of toeches) she caste no reflection on the reverbaetrtaing double doors. The sound was concussive rather than percussive. He thovuthn it must be the lack of light, but the qwhite and the ;ack fo reflectiomn made hi think of vampires,. That'd be about right, he thought, recalling his bank balance. She had been equakly insubastail, back in the operating., her fin gers grasping ast him as bthe receptinists around the bottlre,es and aseemingto sliude around his foprearma dn wrists as though they wre made of palsti, in China, and were till there. He had nevr felt so distant from her. She had begged, hwoever, don't leave me alone, I won't be left alone, you canb;'t just leave me here to rott, and forget about me. So he hadn't, though inthis, as in everuything, like a pane of glass on the wind, he didn;'t have any choice. 'Open it,' Johnny said. The glitchy, poixelly backs of the men seemd to tense, to grow one poicel line narrower, to shrink from the walls. Tonytw a sremineded of his Doom, one of the first games jhe had owned, and the sinking seneastion of petrification, bvoth of fear, and of addiction, sat befroe the cmputer like a stone, gradually and incraesingly unable to move. He thought this was how the end would be. Johnny didn't repeat himself but walked to the doors,a nd began to pull the right side to the right. Words were unwelcome here. Above and before the door, The hills signage ws gone. Tony imagined it high in the penines, a philogical riddle for whatever came after humanity and their languages. A riddle with a dull answer. Before the door, below wheer the sign had hung, a snow drift had mounted, shiny back as an abdominable snowman, hunkered downa nd waiting fro somebody to steo on him. They would have to cloimb over it. The other men had joined Johnny, or worked on the left pane, darwing them liketeethn that had rotted into the gum, finding jams for the doors when they were open. The foyer fileld with air and wailed like a mouth which could not quite get out the sceam it wanted to. I've been wanting to scream for years, realised Tony. It was unfair to say; since he got married. Maybe; a year after. They clutched up the snow bank, hands shying from its alien cold. Outside the hospital was Anotehr Place as much as the Other Place had been. A landscape on a moon, but with oxygen. You could tell, because te oxygen was on the move, and at a speed, and weighed them down, until the scrambled, wet by sleet and chill as though carwling a hard concrete bank up froma reservoir. Te other side of the doors, beyond the summit of the drift was no place for thoughts, let alone speech. Anything tony amitetd, as with others, found someplace better to be within an instant, was blown away by the magnitude of the gale. From the scattered clutching of torch light here and there, harried acxross the sky, the clouds were low, like Mordor had gone too far and smoked out every part of the Earth, a,d not just the m\\Iddle. They walked, or staggered, sideays as much as forwards. Their plan had three parts, and a final aim. 1)Go to the mulit storey car park and siphon all the fuel from all the cars. 2) Return to the security offiuce not far from recetion and call for help. 3) Descend to the basement, and refuel the remaining rgenerator. The aim) Hunker down in the operating theatre and wait for help because teher was no way they were going to beat this storm alone. Of all thse, only thr last seemed attracxtive in the blasted existence that became Yony's body. Then this too twisted away, along with his name, until all he wanted was death. Deatj lying down and letting go, became an oasis to him, to which eh wonederd, whispering 'death'", "label": 1}
{"text": "death deatj, as anotehr might murmur water. His lips might have been moving, eh should be stopping, but hi legs would not quit there incessant steppin ga dn he found himself in the shelter of the multi stirey. He realised, as the sound of howling aginisedc wind stopped gnashing in his ear drums, that it ahd been bare;y twent metres. The distance had stripped all he had of him, his furs, his layters, his skin, his decnecy, right down to the insanity that lurked beneath. He slapped himself. 'Never stop,' he said, thinking of a dyin g SeamConnery crawling across a floor uin The Untouchables. 'never stop fightikn g till the fight is done.' (If it had not been for the wind, from his frozen lips,m it would have sounded as 'Neber op, neber op iking ill uh ike is dun'.) The others were around himand pointing aroudn the corner that lead away from the prevailing tempest. They cronered this, and across iced, rginng steps,a nd up into em,pty atriums of the multi storey. Inside, there appeared to have been a mammooth bumber car tournmanet. Cars sat as skewed angles, many taking over several parking bays, especially weher they jad been flipepd, and the gale had shorn them of their rooves, or scatrerd tgeir sfaterty glass like droplets. Cannisters and jerrty cans came out of back packs in slow motion, fingers made tardy by the cold. They went from emngien to engine, and to the fuel caqps, unscrewing in labouref actions, as though releasing the lids of stubborn jars. 'Loosened it for you,' said Tony, to Irwin, who ignored him. Soon, several were full, and a glow fo satisfaction was lit in the group which meant Solsjaer accidentaly smield at him, when he was grinnign wildly, and showing off his collection of three cans. Tony blinked back unexcpeted tears' At a smiele? How far have I fallen? I'm bloody publsihed writer! ' and stared at the small, blue corsa. Our car. He turned, Joanne was nowhere to be seen in the crpty- shadfows of the car park. 'Jesus, what's that stink?' said Irwin approaching the fuel cap. The car was at the balcony fo the multi srtoery, its low bonnet protected ina way the range rover beside it hadnm't been. By the lee of the metal, slatted boundaries. The world ourtside rushed by the slats like a train of snow and the howl fo somebody caught under its wheels. 'It guckign pongs,' said the man, his voice muffled by its sleeve. Bad ,meat put into the freezer, thoguth Tony. That was the odour. Dead dog, he added, internally. I thoguth the dog had been a dream. A hallucinatuion caused by conscussion., A troip form his head falling againstt eh dashboard. 'It's coming from the trunk,' said irwin, starggered forward ina zombie gait, sniffing in twitching, disgusted actions, away and to the let, like JFK; he nasal equivalent of having to stare at an accident. Tony looed up, searching for Johny or Davey ' he couldn't remmevgr whyh- and he din't remember that he waas when he saw what was happening to the Hills. 'Jesus,' said Davey,. Who was behind him. Soemthing about Davey's lacj of swearing made Irwin stop and stare. The hospitalw as lit u;p Noit liem aChristmas Tree, despite the superfluity of snow, but like a light bulb. Or, thought Tony, thinking of The Shining, y Stephen King, liem Dasnny's call. It wavered, blazing like out so forcivbly it became a blare the ears could sense, a frazzle of sizzling mortar the nose could catch, a knowledge that the Other Said ewas coming through. It was either then windo or female sceaming sieevd through the air, also , which had stileld somehwat, like passerbu=y at that accoident, uanble to help themsleves. Tony culdn't. In places, like the filaments omjn a light bulb, pure light could be seen. In others, skin glabrous and slicked and crab-red, moving in in slow actios n that npalyed with the mind as did a paraleel train moving from its platform, ad n yours remaisn staiuonary,. It was didfficuylt to tell of the thingn they swa was miving or sucking their world into it. The sucking, at least, as a clue. Could be heard. 'We've got to get back.' 'The woman.' 'Let's get moving.' Thes, and orther manyly thin gs were said by the men, but Tony couldn't help but notice that Irwin was crying, ntoi with his eyes, that seemd frozwn by the wweather or byt eh sight, but by his nostrils in oing liknes of gruellish snot. Tony caught his bretahe and struglled momentaruily to let it go, inorder to take the next. Irwin was a giant fo man, in the col,d and the drak he seemd a hewn statue the storm and the apocal;psye had uncovered, a huiman the type of which had not been seen sinbce man developed luxuries, and niceities and manners, and all things soft and southern. Here, watchign him weep woithout being able to shed a tear, Tony though he might crumble, and be lost amid the rubble of the multi stroey, dust between and settled on broken safety glass. Joanne grabebd him by the shoulder. 'get fucking moving you pathetic arsehole,' she shouted. Unlike in the years of their relationship, it was exactly what he needed, and he did. Back down the toothy, frost as enamale, steps, out into the cold. Some of us could make it no further than kneeling, too tired to lie down. Lying or knelt, we moved no more, motionless as the populace of Pompeii. I wondfered fleetingly if ages from now aliens would uncover us at the end, coated not so much in rock or snowfall but in our own despair. I wondered what race would come next until I realised I kne.w I ad seen its king. Our face were caught in mid-tic, lips snarlinga sif to cough or retch, as though, liekm the Romans, nature had caught us out,", "label": 1}
{"text": "trapping our expressions forever, the wind had changed and brought with a priaptic blast. There was nothing brain bolingly hot, however, about the rush tha played havoc on the double doors pof the foyer. Itw as cold as alien fingertips, and as long redaching, clawing between niches asnd the rubvver sela of the door. I would have shrugged my shoulders and collapsed at the hopelessness of it all, but I couldn't move, and I was not alone. None of us could, intil Johnny raised a finger and pointed and saids to the background of percussion from the glass behind him, 'Irwin. Solsjaer,. Get back to the woman. Check they are'' He didn't finish. The music of the doors would not stop, andjarred against his words. 'Davey' Tony' Ewe'll get to the security room. The radio.' Tony. He didn't mention me. Tonyw a worming his way in, with his Hiugh Grant charm, his southern manners, his illusory charm. Didn't Johnny know writers were full of it? I knew I was angry because he had don e the sam ewithme. Made me think he was the one, when he was only one tosser amongst many. Men, I couldn't help but think. They were rising and walking passed the reception, toward the corridor beyond and right. I followed, feeling cold through to the centre of me, and hollow there as ice-rheimed caves, and bitter as though they bwere thronged with stalagtites of frost. It wouldn't take much for things ti crack on the inside. The corridor wasn't long, and then a right down another empty bar for the hand-wahsing stations (danistation',s with posters of pointing hand that looked disembodied uinder the torch beams, as though the things fro the other side were forcing trhourhg, once mor,e an dsuggesting that nobody walk past the basins with their soap dispensers without washing. It would only take a minute, the wording read. And think fo the lives it would save.) The doors to the security room were on the right of one and these (on the other side fo which was a water cooler which had burst its frozen pipe and now stood ina small ice-rink of its own, one forlorn plastic cup dawl;ing on it, like a teenager with thoughts of a skating partner. It was dented, and bowed to one side.0 The security doors were not locked, which didn't surprise me. Nothing ewas the way it ought to be. Inside, the jitterbug torch-circls/ovals lit banks off cctv screens that must have been actingon a back up supply. Theyw ere grey but on, like, it seemd, my eyes. Davey tried a phone, unhooking it from the wall and jabbing the buttons as though we were puttingout a cigarette on skin, fingers twisting. His expression was equally deformd, each time a light caught it, which was more often than I woul dhav e liked, optimally, and I could imagine him as a toruerer. H ehadc seen enough, I guessed, to make a good fist of it. I thoughtof their father, his and Johnny's, and the King of tumours. He would make an apt king,; a good fit. 'Nothing,' said Davey. He probably swire before this, in rhyme, but I had blanked this out, so usedc was I to hearing it. 'Computer,' Johnny clicked his fingers. Davey followed he sound and it came on, a blue screen, the atoolbar and icons. The 'e' on it circled, bringing uo a sandyimer that semed happy to be upeneded over and over, its picels of sand as neverending as a desert. On another screen, white dots did the sma,e in imitation of a blizzard, until I realised it was the only camera on the outside of the buildinbg that was n ot a dark-screen. Another view pointed o n the front doors we had left, moments before, with the snow bank piled behind like ayeti tensed and about to pounce, to break in. 'Fuckiong'' This time, it seedm. I had accidentally redacted the 'nothing'. As Davey pulled open darws and cupboards, lancing his totrchlight within (highlighting folded blue jumpers, black trousers, name tags reading in winks of suilver 'Daniel' and 'Kevin'), I could feel Tiony swelling. He wanted to speak. I had been around him long wenough nto know the jitter of his slight fram, the way it seemd even his head grew at the thought of having something important to say. Tony said, 'Try the longwave.' 'What?' Davey said. He hadn't sworn, I was pretty sure, but he mighta s well have. Even in the dark, his face could be read, ridges of shadow,a nd looming brow. 'The longwave. It's what anybody who's still out there, anybody in authority will still be listening to. You canm't hack. You can't corrupt it. If you broadcast, somebpdy will hear it, and the security services are always listening. If we still have a government, they be listening, one of them will be listening. Try the lonbgwave.' The ast wqas a breathless corking of his mouth, as though the line of speech had reversed direction and been xswlalowed back up. 'What are you,' asked Davey. 'some kind of spook?' He may as well be, I think. He's insubtaial as a ghost, as eeliable. 'No'' aid Johnny. There wsas the pause there in his voice, that opening, coming to regard Tony as someone to be respected, listened to. How many years ago did I make that sam e mistake? '' he's got a point' a good point. There, long, it's a longwave. I didn't even notice it- it's so out of date. Let's get on it.' Tony moved as thogh he would get thewre first, btu hesitated, allowing Davey in. I could feel the chess motions of his actions, the way he allowed the manc to re-establish control, let him have these moves. Later, Davey would wake up and realise he'd been checkmated. I looked at Johnny and knew just how. Tony ws angling for a best mate. Davey turned the long wave on.", "label": 1}
{"text": "There was rushing whine through the speakers, wasps in a hury, which slowed to a static crackle. Davey passed the micropne to Johnny. Johnny flicked a switch on its reverse and a red light glowed into a terminator-eye kind of life. 'Hello, hello,' he said. In the red aurobla he blanched, face goujng ads thin and lantern-long as that of the tattoo on Tony's forehead. His eyes weer pitch shadows- holes where coal may have been dug from. 'Hello. Testing.' 'It's on,' said Tony in his I'just;want'to-be-helpful murmur. Davey turned to him. Now, his expressionw as unreadable, but made me think of a serial killers lack of affect. Murderous, in its own way. He know,s I thunk. He knows a asnake in the grass when he steps on one, and he's going to step on you. Iyt was all I could do to stop myself laughing aloud, buyt then this sensation jhad come over me several times, and I knew to put my palm to my lips and grin into it. 'Hello,' said Johnhy. @hello, we're in the Hills hospital Something' strange is happening here. Look. I mena. I know something strange has happenede everywhere, but I think' I think the thikng that's happenimng here is why something strange has happemed everywhere.' Johnny moved the microphone away fromhsi mouth and breathed as though he had been French kissing it. 'Jesus,' he said. He heaved air and brought the microphone back,. His eyes staring at it as it came as though he couldn't stop the movement, and he was goingto have to go back in. 'Look, send people. Snybody you can. The police, the army, whatever. If you want to stop this ' look just send whatever you have. The hills, The Hills, hospital.' 'Hello,' said a hoel in the static. 'yes!' said Davey, punching his brother in the arm. Jihnny staggered butr smiled. 'Hello Yes, hello.' Tony could be heard laughing, high and wide lippe as a sun that had gione wrong, goine out. I grinned into my palm., gums wideingin until I thought I might accidentally swallow it. 'The Hills,. The Hills hospital did you say?' 'Yes! Yes!' said Joihnny, not able to sya it, as he was laughing also. 'The Hi' Yes!' 'We're sending somebody,' the voice int eh gaps between the static was laughing too, but now, I thought I recognosed it's tone. I thought of a lift. An intercom. 'Her;'s coming.' Theb laughter became a giggle, low and underminging, sapping that if Johnny and Davey. They kenw when they were being mocked. It took Tony a loon-laughing moment longer, buyt he quietened alonhg with everybody but the voice. 'Can you see him. He's a man. A man called Jack. You can rely on a man called Jack. He's your best defence.' A knight wearing white. The Jack of tumours. 'He's alreadfy there. You have a problem, you say. How is ut with you humans. Houston, you have a problem? He's there, now. Ding, dong. Will you let him.' I glare at the monitor I had seen, of the doubvle doors in the foyers and the snow drivcft beyond. I pointed. 'THERE!' I shout. I'm too loud for my ears and they redden and feel as if they are attempting to withdraw back down to my nape, which is proickling. The men are loolking at the monior, hwoever, and I neded to, because I couldn't see the Jack. 'I can't see him' I say. 'I can't see him,' said Tony,. Fear making amess of his cultured tone. 'I can't neither,'s adi Davey. Johnny remained silent. He was good at pointing, and did so now. Not at the top of the drift, but at the centre of it, beyond ten seal in the centerf of the double doors. 'he's herte, oh yes, he's here,# the voice on the radio was becoming excited, an dits reguister rose and fell in the dark, fingers iona aural blackvboard. He didn't have the voice for radio, but I hesiotated to imagione what his face might be like. 'Your saviour. He'll fight off the baddies. He'll lay them low. Your white knight!' 'Turn it off' said Johnny, as though to the others, though he flicked the switch hims elf. In the middle of the snow drift could be seen a black dot. It became an eye of black,. Then a cirl of black. 'It's coming out of the snow drift.' Voices. They, and whose they were, had become unpimportant. Only the widening circle. 'It's walking thorruhg nthe snow.' 'You know how hatrdf that snow was,' 'It's waliign right through it.' I thought at least one fo the voices muist have beend my own. 'It's a visor.' It was,a nd then a white gloved hand, reaching out of the snow and to the door. The pane fell in ward. From the foyer, along the corridor, through the entrance to the security room, the screech of its fall could be hear., amd the shatter. My heart semed to mimic it, framgemnetingto heart beats all around my rib cage. Another arm, also white, and a chest the same, and a back pack. A backpavk? 'It's a bleeding astronaut.' This was Davey. The 'bleeding' from his mouth sounded forced but so did th rest of the words. It was. The asytronaut stood in the grey of the kidle of the cctv cscreen, in the cntre of the reception, glowing white. Itw as otherwordly, its sheen, its slow m,ovements, the ay it walked as a zombvie might, triught he chairs, into the corridor that went the oither way, towarad the strairwells and the lifts, and into another cctv screen. 'Where's it going?' said Tony. H esounded oike a teacher who knew the answer. I didn't have time fior this. 'Just bloody tell us.' 'What's it carrying?' asked Johnny. 'Soe kind of gfun.'

Just ask him, that little' 'It's going to the opeartying theatres,' sawid Davey. His face, in the light of the computer monitor and then long-wave's diodes deemed to be carwling back from s is own mouth, as though it was given off a astink, a small, unwholesome hanimal had died in there. 'Yes,'sadi Johnny. Nodding with his lantern long head. He rose. 'Yes.' 'Look,' said Tony. The astronaut was at the corridor that ran to the operating theatres. 'We need to go after it,'said Johnny. If huis face were lantern long, his eyes had gone out, need ed more oil. 'We need'' The astronaut was knocking. Thick gloves moving backward and forwardc slow as though ti were doing so in deepst space. All there disbelief seemd suspended. On the cctv screens, it looked more real thanm all of them combined, as the candy king had. Now it's our time,. I rmemebred. 'They wouldn't open it, though.' Said Ton y playing the soothing, calm head. 'They're expecting us, aren't they, pal,' said Davey, driiblign enoughn bile I thought, to shiort circuit the computer keyboardc beneath his mouth. Tony, mouth fixed on huis face,m eyes on the monitors, didn't seem, to notice. He kept soft peddling his vouice, turn it ivcer like the wheels of a pedalo ona flat syun staiendd bay, calm, calm, calm. Trust me, mate. 'By the time we get there, they'll have shot it. It will be all over.' Coward. On another screen, they could see the operating theatre. Irwin rose, walked to the door. In the square of greu, e looked substantaily less talll than he had before. He put his hand on the handle, his shoulders relaxing with relief. Sd whay shoiuldn;t he? I thought. No hot sporings, waitingfor his leader, his commandent of the Red Army, his Cantona. He's about to be kung fu kicked where it hurts, I added, withoutn meaning to. On the other monitor,. The astronaut lowered it right arm and the gun that stuck from it.The door opened. The astronaut fired. Plume sof air soft soaked the corridor to its rght. Irwin soaked the operating theatre with a plume of liquid that appeared to eb oil, in the grey cctv light. Sojsear fired as his friend fell. The astronaut hesitated as though thinking about what it would liem for lunch, the continued into the room. There were holes in its suit. Nothing came from them. For some reason, I expected air. There certainly wasn't any bloods. I recalled the visor, and no hin t of anything beyond, and realised I should have seena face. Jack wssn't there, not corporeally,. As a huink of living tissue that could be killed. It fired at one of the women. I thought 0- I really should have taken the tiem to learn her name, as the side of her face was vloiwn aeway by the bullets of the gun. She fell, also, attemopting, it appeared, to screean, but losing most of the sound out of the worng pklaces. The silence of the cctv monitors made what would have been eerie, almost unbleievabel. Itw as then that I realied we should all be moving. 'This is real,' I shouted, hitting Tony because I didn't dare strioke the other two. They would hit back. 'Get moving. Get ion save them getm get, get,' I realisedc I pribaly sounded oiikke one man with adog, and din't care. Tony crioed out in pain. 'Get off me woman!' he yelled. The two men turned by gradiuents to stare at hin, slow as the astronaut, and as they loomed aeay from the screens, Johnny reeled up from his seat. 'Get the jerry cans, grab them, come on come on!' They were all runnin g. My feet felt hot as a rash beneath me and it was speradingm at a canter, across the floor, between,. On set of feet driving the other on, along the corridor, up the starirs, to the second floor, out throught he door, there was the sound of air released in ahiss - more bullets- and the staypuffed back of the astronaut, swells of Michelin man fabric backing out of the door. It turned toward us,. It's visor was smeared awith liquid, that, on it, seedm purpkle, thought eh spahse on its front were a cheerier shade of red, and crimson on its nASA badge. Davey fired and it rasiec its gun. At me. I6 fired. I'm going to die, I managed to think, which proved, at elats,. That the spopedof thought was quicker tajn hat of a bullet, but,. Somehow it missed. #'The cans' yelled Johnny, and he was behind it, as a mythological hero, thoug, instead of jumpoing on the atronautrs back. He glugged oil across it. Davey slid, letting go of the thought of being able to stand this, under the arc of the gun, and did the same to its legs. Then, as the atrinaut gyred , they skided away, further down the corner. Itw as then that I redalised Tony wss till in the stairwell, staring trhpigh the glass windows. 'Now, fire,' shouted Johnny. They emoited, each, a clip, into the Jack, which seemd to deflate it slightly, but not enough,until. Abruptly, a spark seemed to catch the oil, and the atronaut became a pillar of fire, marbel burning, salt ablaze. It glitted at its visor and lurhched, firing at the wall, which responded by developing holes. Grafually the flames revealed the nothing beyond the astronaut suit and the Jack sank to its knee, which, in turn, burnt to thoughs and then notihing, but the visor, lying on the charred corridor. The smell was burnt brown,", "label": 1}
{"text": "sugar, burnt black. The light from the operating theatre made a coffin of light in the corridor, in which the remains of the astronaut was a grave dug, but unfilled by anything but the visor, which, black in self, shone yellow on its right, as though it saw the sun rising. No such lucjk, Tony thought, unable, himself, to get up from where he had sunk, head cocked, almost in prayer, against the corrdior's plastic railing. Itw as purple, he was pretty sure, but he had begun to question whther colpoutrs meant what they used to, now there was so little light. If colours as a concept was dwindling, the rods inhis eyes shortening. With the light from the bulbs above the operating table, on them? Tony womndered, was the stenmch of blood mixed with guts mixed with faeces that had come out of holes that shouldn't exist and , more, he wondered,w a steh world liekm this, now. A braile of existence, but pussy, boiled up, lie marsh, as much a scratch and sniff as Braille, everything what it smelt like or felt like, amd nothing what it ahd been, under the sun,so much of which seemd to have been defined by what it looked like. And taste, thatw as another thin. Most of Tony's taste seemd to derive from, his nose. His tingeu hyad little say in the matter of what things tasted like. And, on top of this (an dwhat a heap of slef piyty that made) there was too little food, or food thatw asn't spam or baked beans, to make of taste anything more than apassing resemblance yto what it jhad been, as a passin passage to the gut. Joanne had been shouting inhis face. Get up. You pathertic, etc, etc, blah, blah blah. His hearing seemjd to hav e deciedd to go the ay of his sight. Of this he could be glad. Te gale outside, fro Tony had receded, though the snow could be seen at the sma ebreak flake speed, rushing passed the windows under the odd circle of torchlight, wherein it appeared orange as spots of dehyradted urine, or in the dark, where it had the lookm of moths, all desperate. It had been a long time since they hadca light to fly around, he guessed. They were probably like he had been, for the last thrre yearfs of marriage, drivem near mad with frustratuoin, longing, and what, he guessed, for them constituted a lack of sex. Get up. Do something. You pathetic, la,la la, who cares really. She and the words and their sound had utterly departed, in the end. Tanhnkfully, given, even he blanked her out, he couldn't her halotosis. It had always been that way with Joanne, and he hadc never gotten round to tel;linmg her.Residues of guilt an dhasame pumped his blood harder, until he recalled that he simpky didn';t acre and anymore and it sunk back into the thickened morass of his heart. It was never the right momenet. Either mid argument or later, when they made up. There ewas an delicate ecosystem to thewir relationship, argue/makeup/argue/make up, and the mention of how her breath smelt like she ad eaten his hope but forgotten to swallow, and it was in there somewhere, rotting away, felt as though it would send the whole thing into climate change meltdown. Climate change, he thought. He laughed, The sound was a broken croak. 'Cro-ak' his throat managed. Climate, change, try this on for size, you deniers. And yes, we did bring this on ourselves. Hee closed his eys and opened then. It wasn't the win, though he could never sleep through wind. The years since he had lpeft home were fileld with the sure knowledge that every house he settled in would fall down around hgis ears, at the merest hint of a gale. As if the big bad wolf chased Tony from city to city, hoping he would decide that straw was the best Garnd Designs choice, as though he coudlnt' make it in this big bad worl,d and all his designs would comke to nothing but rumble around his be, while he lay in it, refusing to come up out of the covers. No, it wasn';t the wind. He had let go of that, nor the gentle, slam slam slkam, of the helicopter aginst the side of the buiding, and not even the tremours that occasionally mafde Tony feel hr was on the set of Star Trek, and the entire building might go sideways, shields down, before combusting. Itw asn;'t even the sound of guinshot,s by which the positijn of Davey could be tracked, his veru own form of tagging, as he had been running and shooting since the astronaut and 5the death of the women. No. He couldn';t skleep because he was standing up., he has gotten up. He wsn't sure what itw as, her words or the stench of her braeath, but ihad gotten through his apathy. He guessed itw as the altter. He swayed as The Hills shook to its roots. He wwsas unsure how much more the suoerstorm it could stand but, well,m hey, it should stop being such a wimp. He was still standing, wasn;'t he, and look nat the shit he had waded through. He alked to Johnny, bent, grasped the side of his head,a nd spoke into his face. Johnny didn't flinch. Tony blinked. He had rather gambled on giving as bad breath as his wife, but Johnny, in a pool of arm,s and legs and a line of milk white dribble from his mouth, the coilour of the limb of a young, northern boy who jad never yet been on vacation. 'Johnny,' said Tony. 'John,' suad Tony. 'Jonathan.' That did it. The Cantona of a Redf SArmy, now, of two, looked at him, a flinch of eyes, as though the corneas had been slapped by miniature palms. They were red around the green. I never noticed they were grebe, thought", "label": 1}
{"text": "Tiony, and then he couldn't but thinkm of You Song, 'Green or blue, I don;'t recall.' H ewondered if he was falling in love with the man. All the better to betray him, he added, in a voice that sounmdede suspiciously like Joanne'sw. Over the years, she had slowly no longer needd to be present to ofer a critique. Irtw as some achgeovement, thought Tony. 'You have to get up,m' he said. 'Get up.' Johny rubbed his face and, by way of his temples and foreheads and nose, his eyes. His expression was blurred by the passing of his hand,s unsure of what it should be, like a child waking and trying to decide why his father looked angry, Tony could have told,m him, and then did. 'You have to burn your Dad.' The tiles squekwed under the skin of her heels. Tony would haqve bent and wiped his forehead of the sweat that was shiverin g their, droplets clinging to his skin, it seemd, in nostralgia for the heat they had left behind. He would have bent but was alreadyu bent double, and not from carryin g the doctor's girl. He had been hun chbacked over for some time, his nerves set so on edge by the ex[losions o thunders and wind an dgrenades within and without the Hills, that he was one broiling living twitch. There were no more social niceties in his expression, passing a hand over it, as he did after doing so for his brow, he mapped out the contours of a an infernal terian, twisted and troughed by panic and terror that had squatted so long on his cheks an dlips that they ah dsome kin dof legval ownership[p. If there could be said to be alaw, anymore,e bar the law of natural selection. And if there is thiks, Tony thought, something made of human woiulod win out, but itg wouyldbn't be us humans. He dropped the girl head first against eh wall, and her scalp slouched down it. Te blood this left behind was invisible to an eye so used to being naked, to being without light. He could hear ten saquelch of her progress and his imagination which had stenmgthened in the dark, painted in the crimson. Tony knew his sense of sightw as dwindling, along with a sense fo what was real, but felt no comparative stremgethenming in any of his other senses, and w2as supposed to set in. Except his sense fo worthlessners, which had multiplied down here in the dark. Cantoan loomed closer. He carried a lantern. Tony wondered where he had found it, until he relaised he didn't care. His face was as oblong and leadenm as the lines around the lanterns edges.It looked positivcely victoiran. There as nothing positive about Johnny's exptression. But then he was about to cremate hi dad, and a father that didn't seem gone, his eyes staring up at the two men and twitching, foloowun g the light, as a wasp legs woul don a windowsill, after it had been swatted. Autonomic reaction, thought Tony instincelky, without pausing to consioderw aht this meant. Thoguth was beginning to have little relevance to him. He wqaas descending. Devolving, in direct opposition to the cxancer. It sounded aqs thougheh ws guloping. A she iusedc to do in the cinema, w=nervous, ona girst date, starin g and unable to stop, untiol he noticed th eupoturned jeery can in Johnn'ys hand. It emptied. 'Get you Mm,; jihnhy said. It coud have been a question. If it was, the leader of the two string redc arm,uy showed ;little interest in the answer. Tiony nodded (he didn't know why- it seemd the thing to do, though Johnny wasn't lookin gat him) an dturned. He found the torch I hiss pocket, brought it out and swun the lever around until the dynamo of the light flicked in. It had a sound somewhere between buzzing and whining an dhissing, but loud, like a mosquito that ahd fouind itself into his ear. Additionally, it didn't allow him a spare hand for the gun he had taken from Soljaer, a colt .45, which was stashed (like a happy-to-see-you he thought, and grin like a n elastic band being habitually stretched) in his left jena pocket. The safety might ajave been ofgf, it might not. Tony didn't seed much difference when the world was the way it was. How could a small clipm of metal offer safety of any kind? The buzz/whine/hiss of the light stoped him hearing the approach of Davey, of Scolesym, until he ssaid. 'Yiou going to burn him, eh?' TYony froze, his body and his hand. The lguth before him flickered out like a hope he had barely trealised he owned, now gone. He turned, and managed nearly to fall. In the circumference fo the lantern light that was cut at its edges by the chords of the hppitsl walls (didn't they look thick and finalm wasn;t that alie) Davey stood. He didn't appear to be anywhere near as tall as he had before. He held , in his right hand, a grenade, unlciped, his thumb keeping in, by the look ofn it, the pin. 'Davey'' something waass waking on Johnny's face. Fear, by the looks, fo it, thought Tomny,. Buit of alight sleeper that one. 'After all he did for. Growing up. He dragged uis kicking and screaming into this world. Made men of us.' The fear was gone. Scared off by something strong. It looked a lot like rage, though wearied, bled of its shouting. 'Really> Did he Davey? Where was mum, is that your next question? He made men of us with his fists, didn';t he. He made a runaway of her with the same.' 'Shut it, you two faced shit,' sad Davey. ;Bet you're burning them on the say so of that southern lying pomce, eh?' 'So what if I am?' 'That tattoo, bro. that tattoo, we oput on his forehead. That might as well have been", "label": 1}
{"text": "looking at the little girl. Tony guessed she was six, though he had no experience with little girls. 'Don't let her fall asleep.' She had slumped against her mother's shoulder, potato printing it wet. In the streetlights, the pressed blood was the colour of thick, dehydrated urine. That's what the smell is, thought Tony. He suurptiously pressed his palm to the crotch of his jeans. It wasn't him. He hadn't thought the apocalypse would stink like this. 'If she falls asleep she could slip into a coma.' 'Come on, darling,' the mother shook her child. 'Uhmmana,' said the girl, or something like it. Tony wasn't listening. 'The radio,' he said. With a twitch, BBC turns on the radio. Radio four crackled to life, the channel of the Stones' choice. Marriage has made everything about them old before its time. Especially their marriage. That got old the quickest. Radio four said, 'We go across to our studio in Belfast. Hello Simon... Hello' Simon'' Tony hears a bang. Following this, there is a weaker bang. Not long later, there is the whap of a bang that is going out with a whimper. It is coming from his spine and he freezes. Tony tries not to turn. The freezing helps with this. Simon says, 'Hello. Hello. Yes, I'm here.' Simon doesn't mention where he is. My wife is in the boot, thinks Tony. It would be difficult to explain. He coughs to cover a final whapping. He says, 'Turn it up, please.' They don't. Nobody's listening, thankfully. Simon says, 'It's five thirty nine, here, and the sun is due to set in fifteen minutes at this time of year, and should be setting now. With the lack, or low coverage of clouds, out met office tells us that it would, should, be a beautiful sunset,m one of thos summer sunsets you rmemebr in the long winter. But it has gone. The sun, not just the sunset, Gone. Frankly, we're staring to get reports of panic on the streetsw, maybe rioting, lready, which is not a good sign, but that is unconfirmed,as yet.' 'Yes of course, Simon and we wouldn't want to add to the panic, so I guess your saying, there's not been any confirmed cases of rioting.' 'Yes, yes,' Simon was shaken, or ashamed, the adio was ill tuned, even as the car idled down toward Manchester, around abandoned cars, and around, wrecks. No-one had blocked the road, yet, so there wasn't a jam, but there was blood of the tarmac, Tony could tell. 'But there is no sun, no sun that I can see. No explosion. Not even an implosion. This is nothing like we were told might happen to the sun, one day. This is' this is just nothing.' He was cut off, not by the London studio, but by BBC's hand. 'That's enough of that.' The little girl was moaning, 'Mummy, mummy, what's going on' and Tony felt a hiving rash of shame going up his nape. Still, he reckoned, she should worry about her head first, before the rest of the world. He looked up, the skin of his face jangling, expecting Joanne to be staring at him, that cudgel look again, then away. He could even sense it, these days, through the seats and her unconsciousness, from the boot. Tony twisted in his sesat, seeing movement by the verge of the a-road. The dog from the car, as much loloping skin as flailing hir, staggering toward the twin rails at the road's edge. It struggled against it, thrashing as if a dolphin in a tuna net, then, as it raised it's head, were-wollf like, to the street-lights. (There ws no moon, and Tony wondered if that, too, had gone the way of the sun, and if what had taken them was on it's way down.) Tony say that half of its face, its tongue, his lips, its left eye, and been scraped away. He recalled the window it had been hanging from, the glint of happiness ion its eyes, and thought now the glamour he saw was shards of glass. Why do they call that safety glass? he thought. 'We've got to stop,' he said. The words were a blurt, out into the contused silence of the corsa's cab before he knew they were in his mouth, let alone his brain. 'What?' said BBC. The word curled, smoke froma warning fire around the heads of the four strangers who hitched with them. 'There wasw as dog, it was injured.' They passed a woman,staggering as the dog had been. She wass calling something, hut as they passed she turned her head away, abbreviaiting the shout, so that it became a bark, as though she were calling it by its canine name. 'Look,' said BBC, almost as short as the woman had been. 'We don't have room. Who would chuck out for a dog?' Any one of them, he thought. Start with Nige'. But then Tony had always found ease around animals, when he didn't about humans. He guessed that was the writer in him. The writer in him hated Tony too. Self-loathing, fault-finding, made editing all the more instinctive. He hung back aginst the metal of the wheel arch as BBC took to the hard shoulder. Ahead, brake lights were stacked, red, gambling chits, making progress unlikely. BBC turned off when he could, not long after 'Stop At Starbucks' and their route unravelled back and forth down the west slopes of the penines as thougn they were a thread unknitting the hills. The thread would be light blue, if there was light enough for the colour. There isn't. Often they pass long stretches with only the headlights and Tony can't help but wonder if the dark that passed outside the windows was what would now pass for the world. After an hour or so, they arrived at The Hills. He walked. He supported his ex-wife, her weight, her right arm and hand a ball and chain around his", "label": 1}
{"text": "a name tag, goes that's what he is, a snake in the grass, a devil, lying, wheedling, southern.' 'Shit, and'' 'And I'll kill him, if I ever see him.' Tony felt a dribble fo wetness in his underwear. Tahnkfully, itw as warm. He considered letting go of his bladder, but feared it would make a sopund. He palced a hand on his other hand, steading the shaking, taking care not to accidentally whirl the dynamo of the torch. 'Listen Davey. He- dad- he was the fucking devil. Not just when he';d hd a drink neither, and itw as rare enough to see him without a bottle in one hand,m us by the scruff o the necdk in the other.' 'He hardenede us, for this life. For this en dof worlds. ASnd you,' you go calling the cops.' @lket it lie, pal. You think he buolt you for this. He just enjoyed jhittign kids. And do you rmenbver what he did to that wee, little dog we found on the streets. You know the straving hungrey one. You cried for weeks afterwar. You wou;nd't stop pissing your bed, said you couldn';t get the blod off your lips. Gave yourself coldsores wityh the washing of it. Washign, washing, scrubing.' 'Shut up' shut up' he was making us'' 'Making us ready for this, Well, he didn't know this was coming, did he? And you talk about us working class rising up and killing the bankers whe the end of things come, take over the houses of parliament. Go back to when real men rtuled the world. Well, how did we do, eh? It's our end, just as much as anybody elses. Where did the preparation get us? Eh? Where's the Red Army now. We're a bloody red twosome, We don't even back a bloody gang.' Daveyw as shaking around the grenade. All that seemd steady was the brick of blacknes in the lugth. 'Put the pin back in mate and let's fin ish this.' Davey shook his head. It seemed a natural extension of his termouir, until the thumb came off the pin. Johnny satred at him. Tomny flinched and made to jump against a wall, sliding down it as the girl had before. He heard wetness, and felt liquid on his up lips, spreading to his nose-end as he sank, and by there, as it waas flattened, to his right cheek. The xplsosion didn't come. Davey's tremourijng continued, without losing nay of the shaking of his head, ito laughter. He bent and slapped his thighs. 'Bloody duds,' he laughed. 'Bloody Yugoslavian shit duds. Bloody fucking Serbian useless wankers.' There ws a crack, as though the grenade had farted, had given off a good one, and Dasvey collapsed to the side, his right armj gonme, arterial, blood where it had been before, making a crescent fo st katherine wheel like shimmers brefoe the lanterns, coated its glass, makinga shadow puppet play fo the wall. It rmenided Tony of when the cancer came thorugh. Davey was trying to scream, it seemd, without chheks of lips or even a jawline,and made a huffing, hissing sound instead. Tony rose from where he aa scrouched by the wall. Johnny had beguin to do davey's screaming for him. What was visible between the shadows of his face was making its own shadow puppetry. Devils could be seen through his paper wide skin,. Cahsing aeround his brain. Tony walked to Dasvyer, withdrew the colt from his pocket, flicked the safety off (it had been on, whichw as asensible precaustion he managed to think, when everything nhas gone to shit anyway, he managed to think beffroe hre put three bullets into Davey's brain. He looked down at the dead manc. He had thought he would enjoy that more., but thatw as where thinking got you, he thought. 'I'll get my Mum,' he said, ' and come back and light these two up. Then we'll go through to the other side.' Johny ha gone from screaming to whisperin g. Looking at what he could see of his face, it didn't seem to be him, anymore. 'No, I'll do that alone. I'm going to do what that doctor couldn't't. I'm going to shoot myself up and go and find that fuckin g king.' YTony satred at him. His lips made to speak, but he wouldn't let them. Don't. I'm sick anyway. I've got the bog C. Let me go insyteda. No. Nothing came out. Except hs eys, protruding. 'You can't let him do that,' said a voice. It wa sJOanne. Of courtse it fuckingwas. Sjhe was always there solmewhere was she, the more the darker itw as. Johnny rose and TYony allowed his head to to the smw, to come down in a nod. Itw as enough, perhaps, all Johnny needed, because Tony let him go, running past like a rash of footsteps. 'You know your'e ill.' Voice sin the dark. Her nagging mulpied. 'You can't ket him go on his own.' 'You're a coward.' Hands coming from the dark, zombie, puincing, pushing him to the wall where his blood stillw as. He tottered, uncomprehendingm a spinning top that would never fall. 'You're a coward.' He pushed back, harder than she had, harder than she couyld. She may be better than him, but he ws stronger. Therew s aclunk as what he imagined was the base of her skull it brickwork. He hoped it ws her skull. 'I'm going to find my mother and burn her alive' he said, ' if you don't mind. You never like dher anyway.' 'I ahte you.' It was bare as revealed fangs. He shrugged, and shrugged her hands off. @get off me,' he aid and began to run after Johnny. 'Leva eme alone.' Sjhe didn't.

{"text": "of wind outside had softened, as thoyght The End of The World had bated its breath and was waiting. Waiting to see if Tony, perhaps, have the decncy to simply fall over and stop moving. For some tiem now, it had felt like the right thing to do. He stumbled. Either his body his brain was failing. He wonderd which for long enough to mistime a step and stumble again, and for him to know that wondering meant it was probably his body. I the end, which woiuld make little difference, and the end wasn't far away. He was in it, to an extent, his endgame as well as the earth's. Tony had alwsys thought they had soemthign specialm a talent, a writer, the exact distance from the right sized star to create an dsustain life. Now, tihout the sun, it didn't look so rosy, and he doubt wthether either of them had anything to offer the universe after all. Humanity, et al. He, his mind, his body, were undermined, all, as much as the storeys of The Hills Hospital above the third (and whatever red-light giving life-form undulated there). He flinched, as would a man walking through aforest in the dark, to the flick of twigs about the eyes. His teeth jarring together, the sjkin about the eyesockets tautening, his head flinching to the left. Away from the light jn the third floor. He was theer, now, and iutw asn't only the glare tat made him wrap[ his hands around his head. But her voice, goijn gon an d on. 'Here are you going?' 'You ahv e to stop jhim.' Voices in the dark Abnd, ss he passed the daoctors floor, again ' That's it. If you won't I'll go after him.' The flap of doors, and he was alone. 'Finally,' he whispered, but his lips were cracked and his throat sore, and he couldn't hear it. He went on, upward, and around, his head lolling like a ball that had come off its bearings. He felt lost, until he asaw seven. The MRIO room. His mother. He was going home. Intervening life slid off his shoulders, from hsin waist, off his hips, he stumbled as kicked it off hi feet. He felt anked as a nwrborn, going home, but not to embrace his mother. He ws going home to arsonit it. He held the last jerry can, in his hand, and the rewmainingmatches, no more tha a death rattle in their packet, in his jeans' front pocket. Throughthe door doors, the one on ther gith came back to clip him around the back of the head as his momenetum took him forewardc then backward into it, and to the side, besides which. YTour a pretty boy, aint you, and stipid. Pretty stupid. He grimaced and walked down the corridor which kiltered, going diagonal as a Star Trek scene. Mum was to the ledft. You're not pretty, you're not ugly, you're pretty ugly. And on, and on, and on, he thought, telling his feet to do so, when they would rather not. Te table before the mRI scanner was flat before hi, his mother laid out on it. He raised the torch. It slipped over her gowned body like an unwanted palm. He laid the light on the small table beside the scanner, next to a boxy machine that had done the best of its beeping. Tony felt. Also, that his time was running out, the tiking of it audible to him as the clicking of his lunbgs, as they levered up blood, spatuling it into his throat. Where he felt inclinmed to Cough' coiugh. He held his lips with his palm, took his hand away, and felt like he was still holding his lips. There was something ligh but presesnmt as two slugs on his sklin. He didn't hold it to the yellow moon of light tahgt shone form the torch to the far wall, but could guess it would be red as lipstick. He unscrewed the jerry can. Careful to leave it it mostly full, eh poured on as littlr eas he could to be sure of brunign his mother to a cinder. He dug into his jean's pocket and ferreted, hgis nails biting into him, even through thdenim. They needed a cut. Who gave a fuck? He pulled out a tissue, angruily. He wouldn't be needing that. Car keys. What was the pi9nt, he hadn't even locked it? AS debi card. He could laugh. There, at last, eh slid gfree the matches, opened the box. It didn';t slide but jerked, letting one fal to the tiles of the room's floor. It semed to clatter ther. For the first time, Tony noticed the lull in the storm outside. He bent to retirve, but it must have rolled under the scanner, somehow. He shrugged,a dn dug a finger in. he felt the ribs of two or three more. Brought the first out, crackloing it along the side fo the match box. It agve a brief flutter, like abutterfly in November, and that went out. He sniffed. He coulghed. And ignored the sound of drool splattering from his mouth, onto a soft fabric. He also ignored the thought that the floor shouldn't be soft. Again, the box, the last match, the draw, the strike, it hissed and rattled into light. He raised it into his mother's fce. Itw as so close, he didn't at first recognise her. His own mother. Then she ipned her lips, and mor eimportabntly, teeth to bite him and he jumped backwards,a nd the light went out. What? WHAT? 'What are you doing, little Tony. Coem to burn me have you? After al I did for. The nappy changes, the endless prattling. Oh you wnet on and on,' Tony backed away. His brain had very little to do with it. Not for the first time ,.

Sjhe couldn't be talking to him this way, could she? SDhe could be talking, could she? His back was slapped by the imapact of the door. He 5radcehd around, and clawed for the handle.

How much money have you made from that, eh? A few hundreds pounds. Do you call that being what youew want to be. Soembody who has to keep coming hbacl, cap in hand?' They were in the corridor. The torch was ahead, and the head thatw as out there in the dark wouldn't stop talking. 'And that bloody awaful book I had to read, with all the horrible awful swearing. Cunt this, and motherfucker that' I can tell you, I had to look away every time. To think you call that art. Art!' The starirs, he thought,. Where are the stairs. The door to them should be at his back. Had he wlaked passed. He had nto get down the stairs. He had a flash of imge, of Johhnny's dad and the girl and the lighter Johnny had put donwn, by the all, when he was crying, sobbing, catatonic. To9ny felt himself walk into the wall, and felt like his heart had jumped into his lungs, the latter of which took to beating at the former's pace. But he knew where he was. Tonyleft his right arm fall, and traced he wide (it was lime green I remember, from when there were colours) dado rail, to the double doors of the stairwell. She was coming far slower than her mouth was mioving, and he drew he on, onto the stairs, and down. 'And the women you dated. Good loklkign boy you are, if you can se through all the sztupidity and failure, and those ugly bints'' Tony thought he would fall. On each and every step, his innards jolted, but he made each and was son shielding himself from the lguith of the third. His mother;'s words grew stronger as she passed through it, deeper, as thought the wordxs came from dfeep down below her digrphram, below her guts, from deeper than ecvery sinmgel storey of the Hills, from a place under the Hills. Tony's skin cralweed on th side that faced the third floor double doors. It felt like he was getting the kind of tan doctors warned you against, at tanning salons. He was in the dark again. His world swam and thpose luminous fish shapes were diwn hyer mocving across his eyeballs, in the coean with him. Wheedling little brat. Aslways so weak. I had to kick you out of the hosue to go and play with people, and I woulnd;'t sya friends'' Bring it on, mother, just keep coming. His teeth were clacxkign together already, making the sound of a finger on the pedal of alighre. Click, click, boom. The right floor, the first, his left arm went out and he trcekd the wall. When she came through the doors she made a wet slapping sound, not her mouth but her body,a s though the iomapct of them on her face had taqke away tissuie if not integral, then aethetcially important, such as layers from her cheek. Ad she spokme, then, the sound was slapping, the kin d of noise an anxious person makes, when they spoke, 'God, I wish I'd never met your father, Nothing good evr came of him.' Tony could smell petrol. He welcomed it, allowing the fumes up his nostrils, to ris,e make his brain high he started to grin, the n to laugh, 'His mummy,' he said,. 'Wjhat. What> How adred you take that tone with me.' {assed the corsp[ees, on the right. Except, and shouldn't have bene expecting this' eh thought, theyw erem't tjhere. After al, if she could move, shouldn't they, also? His bowels certainly could. Shit, he thought. The lighter, hwoever, was there, even if they weren't. He click, click lit it and, infront of him and around in a smei circle (rhe wall t his back) were the rthree, the father, the mother, the daughter. A happy little family, all leeri ng in and interent on killing one their sons, and all of humanity. Tony, however, couldn't help laughing. He shurged,a nd brought the lighter up to ione,a dn then anaotehr, and then the third,a nd they went up. I knew him by his smell. He wsn't heer. I knew, however, where, at elasrt he had been. It was the thick, mothy odour of sweat, perhaps on the sur4faces of the doctor's rpom, by wherfe the needle lay, used like a gun, smokingof droplets of urine co,oured liquid. (That was trhen radium,my mind offered, but I was unable to listen top it, no .l not as yet.) It had, above the thuckness of its odour, a sweet edge. I frowned. Perhaps, it wasn't sweat at all, perhaps it was piss. Perhjaps he had wet himself, after the needle had gone in.

It hadn't taken the impact and was still ticking, saved by the wrist it was wrapped around, the veins of which had burst and were lacing blood over th cold flagstones, knitting them red. 'My hasn't time flown by,' Tony whispered hoarsely at the watch. The screamer as still screaming. It was the male nurse.

Toy attempted to smile in return, but passed out. He never wondred where his wife had fallen. I hate you, now. Tony was stood at the nurses' station, his head pressed forward as he did wehen his cheeks rededened, and his smile began to fix, like melted rubber, to his lips. I hate him when he does this. I used to think him handsome. He still is, but he fills my gut with the sugar clotted, bitter after-ache of too much cola. Like own brand coke, the first tastes of him were sweet, his blue eyes, the long face, dark hair, lips a little too full of themselves. It had all been enough for us to move in, together.

{"text": "The Giggle Factory for Katie Stone In the near future, the world runs out of oil. As the bad times arrive, Professor Floghorn invents a way to make electricity from people's laughter, sets up the Giggle Factory, and saves us all. But now the professor is getting old, and has discovered he's no longer funny, and that the power is running out. So, he advertises for a new Head Laugher, to take his place. Tabitha Blatt is a problem child. Suspended from her school for playing practical jokes, she applies for the Head Laugher job by sending in her disciplinary report. Surprisingly, Tabby makes it through to the final interview, along with two other applicants; an interview to be held inside the secretive Giggle Factory itself' Part One Poo on her Pants 'People died. It was a bad time. Your Mum was one of them,' said the voice in Tabitha's head. 'I understand this is a bad time for you. Settling into a new school always is,' said the Headmistress of Tabitha's school. 'But this is unacceptable.' 'Yes, Miss,' said Tabitha, thinking Susan was having a worse time of it, what with having to explain that the brown lumps on her bottom and on the back of her leg had been plastic, and not poo. Tabitha knew their classmates would realise Susan hadn't pooed her pants, once they'd finished wetting themselves with laughter. Mrs Wilbur ' her class teacher ' would have called 'wetting themselves with laughter' an Idiom. Tabitha liked Idioms and spent her Numeracy lessons writing them in lists, such as: A snake in the grass ' (means a sneaky person. A snake on a rock is not as sneaky, but is still not as honest as a hamster in a jungle.) Knock your socks off ' (to be so shocked your socks fall off. Sometimes happens to fat people when they run.) Works like magic ' (pretends to work, but doesn't really, like me in Numeracy.) After plucking the brown lumps off Susan's bottom and right leg, Mrs Wilbur had sent Tabitha Blatt to the Headmistress' office. As she left, Tabby was sure the teacher had called her an 'Idiot!' under her breath. 'And you got these at a joke store?' said the Headmistress. Tabitha nodded and stared at the two lumps of poo in her Headmistress's hand. They looked like they should smear brown marks across her white skin, but didn't; because they were plastic. Tabby chewed her teeth together, before biting her lower lip. She wanted to laugh. One wrinkled lump was smaller than the other. This shorter roll of brown had been stuck on the inside leg of Susan's tracksuit bottoms. The longer lump had been glued to the seat of her pants, but not before Tabby had carefully coloured a black crack, in felt tip pen, on where Susan's bottom would go. 'Well?' said her Headmistress. 'Now, Tabitha, please don't cry.' Tabitha's eyes bulged like water-balloons. The urge to laugh was giving her the strongest desire for the toilet. Either that, or it was staring at poo, plastic or not. The Headmistress looked down at a piece of paper on her desk. Tabitha realised she didn't know the woman's name. There had been so many of them; Headmistresses that is. Wanting to laugh went away and was replaced by a coldness that didn't stop at the goosebumps on her skin, but went right down, deep inside Tabby. She had heard that rooms got chilly if a ghost haunted them. She felt cold inside her heart, and wondered if it wasn't the room but her that was haunted. She could hear the voice, again, and it said, 'It was a bad time. Your Mum died'. She scratched at the back of her right hand and waited for the Headmistress to look up, to stop reading, to speak. 'You had a run-in with Susan Wilkins last week?' the Headmistress finally asked. 'She told all the boys I would kiss them if they found a fly and gave it to me,' Tabitha replied. 'She said I loved flies because I was a little witch and witches love to fly. Freddie Jones gave me a jar of blue-bottles and told me that meant I had to put my tongue in his'' 'Yes, fine,' the Headmistress said. She stared at Tabitha. The Headmistress looked weary. She had glasses with frames slightly narrower than her eyelids and they seemed to be the only thing keeping her eyes open. 'And in response to this tomfoolery; you asked to go to the toilet during lunch, just before P.E' and, instead of going to the toilet, you took Susan's tracksuit bottoms out of her bag, you coloured in a pretend hole on the' bottom' and you stuck this'' The Headmistress shook the two lumps she still held, in her hand, and they rattled like dice. '' on the pretend hole, and one on the leg. And, then, Mrs Wilbur had to send you to me. Why did you do it, Tabitha? I mean, I understand why but' Why?... What good would it do?' Tabitha paused, thinking about the question, before saying, 'Because it would look like a lot of poo had come out of her bottom' and split her pants' and dribbled down her leg.' The Headmistress sighed. Her fingertips tapped out a short, sad tune on the paperwork before seeming to forget how the song ended. They stilled. Tabitha couldn't tell what was written on the paper. She was tall, for an eleven year old, and so could see over the Headmistress' hands, but the writing was upside down and looked boring. Tabby found it particularly hard to read boring things. All she could see was the title, and it read; 'Tabitha Blatt's Disciplinary Report'. [written upside down] 'Well,' the Headmistress said. 'This isn't the first time, is it, Tabitha? And it isn't the first school, either, is it? Yes, I know you keep having to move because of your mother's", "label": 1}
{"text": "of her laughter. We Need To Talk About Tabitha Their cutlery made more noise than the Blatts did. Dad and Joan and Tabitha sat in silence and in a triangle around the square table. The seat by Tabby was empty, Dad sat opposite her and, at the other corner, was her step-mum; Joan, who sat as far away from Tabitha as she could manage. Tabitha had learnt about Equilateral, Isosceles and irregular triangles from Mrs Wilbur, but this family triangle was regular as mealtime. They always sat this way, and said as little as they could. Until, that is, Joan talked to Tabitha; 'This was supposed to be your Dad' s birthday meal.' Dad gulped his beer. It said Cobra on the glass in his hand, in red and gold, and his silver wedding ring seemed dull above the painted words. 'It is,' he managed to say. 'It isn't,' she looked at Tabitha's Dad and quickly looked away, as though tired of seeing him. 'It isn't. It's about her. It's always about her.' She was talking about Tabby, but she wasn't looking at her. 'Sweetheart,' her father's tone was meant to be calming. He sounded desperate. Tabitha saw an old lady, on a table nearby, turn to look at theirs. There were lots of tables nearby. The restaurant, like every one they ever went to, was small, hot, gaudily orange and peeling at the edges, like the pyre they had every bonfire night (no fireworks, just sticks and newspaper and red and orange flames). 'Don't 'sweetheart' me. She's your bloody sweetheart.' Joan turned her nose to stare directly down it at Tabitha. 'What are you going to do without school? Eh? Suspended! It isn't enough you've done it on your Dad's birthday, it's when you can't get a job, because you can't pass any exams, because you keep getting sent home!' 'Sweetheart.' Her Dad's grip was tighter on his beer glass. Tabitha could hear his fingers squeaking. Apart from that and the sound of Joan talking, the world had gone strangely quiet. Tabby thought it was trying to listen. 'I'm never going to get rid of you, am I? No job when you're older, like a leech sucking off my money! What job are you going to do? Hmm,' her nose got longer when it was cross. Either that, or it just got redder. 'Well?' Around a taste like chewed pencil, Tabby opened her mouth. Her lips wouldn't, for a moment, work, and she had to gulp and go crimson before she could say, 'I can be whatever I want to be.' Now, she looked at her father. He looked down into his alcohol. He always used to say, 'Believe in yourself, and it will come true'. He didn't say this, now. Into the silence, Joan said, 'What's that ' a failure?' 'Joan!' Tabby's Dad hissed. 'Well, a failure's how she'll end up; if she keeps going this way,' said Joan. 'I- I'll be the Head Laugher,' said Tabby. Her step mum stared at her, her nose seeming to shorten. Below it, her mouth became visible, as it dropped open. Then a laugh filled its hole. 'Head Laugher!' she laughed. 'That's the funniest thing you've ever said!' The blood in Tabby's head was nearer her skin than it used to be. She could feel it. She felt hot. 'I sent off an application form.' Her fingertips tightened on the table, hanging onto it while everything else looked blurry, as if Tabby and the table were falling down a hole. 'An application form!' Joan was holding her cheeks. Maybe to stop her mouth falling off. She was laughing hard. 'An application for Head Laugher!' 'Yes!' Tabby's Dad was staring at the wall and scratching at his head and running his right hand down the bristle of hairs on his right cheek. He did this when he wanted to be on the other side of walls. 'You're living in cloud cuckoo land. This isn't one of the worlds you like reading about. It's time you grew up, Tabitha Blatt.' Tabby stared at her, but Joan stared too, and Tabby felt tears on her eyeballs, and couldn't keep looking at her step-mum, because she was unable to see properly. She looked down and a tear hit the napkin they had made her wear, on her lap. They continued to eat in silence, except for the happy chatter of Joan's cutlery, and the occasional whines of her father's knife. Tabby didn't eat another bite and the waiters brought their bill quicker than they did with the rest of the diners. When they left the restaurant, the taste of chewed pencil was still in Tabby's mouth. In the cold, February night, the clouds of breathe that rose from their three mouths avoided each other. So did their eyes. Tabitha walked ahead of the two adults, alone, with them behind, side by side. Joan was holding her Dad's hand. Without anyone to talk to, Tabitha noticed the old, cat lady on the corner, staring at her from her window. For once, the nets were drawn back and the window, without them, looked as strangely empty as the old lady's gaping mouth. Tabby realised she wasn't wearing her teeth. A group of three teenagers stood on the pavement that curved around to their house. One of them said two words as Tabitha Blatt passed them and, a moment later, Tabby realised they weren't swear words. They were her name. She looked at the teenagers, but quickly. They were wearing hoodies. She didn't think she knew them, but couldn't be sure. Hoodies scared Tabby, but not as much as the boys inside them. The flat was coming into view and, before it, stood another gang. 'Tabby!' she could hear her father shout. There was a man running toward Tabitha, and he was carrying a shadow on his shoulder. The shadow, under the streetlights, winked. 'Tabby!' said Tabitha's father, again. He was running, but the sound of his feet", "label": 1}
{"text": "was further away than the stranger's. Then, the man had reached her, and the glinting shadow was pressed to her face. 'Tabitha Blatt! It's Tabitha Blatt!' the man didn't say, but someone behind him did. 'Tabitha Blatt'' said the man. Lights came on and slapped Tabby across the face. She blinked, then winced. '' how do feel about getting through to the Next Stage?' 'Um,' said Tabby. She was surrounded. Lights. Cameras. Small, angry, dark-grey clouds on sticks. Babbled questions. Her Dad couldn't get through. His arm was the shape of a question mark, trying to push its way through the huddle. 'Tabitha Blatt, say something funny!' 'Tabitha Blatt, what did you put in your application?' 'Tabitha Blatt, you must be thrilled to get through to interview.' To these, Tabitha replied, 'Unk,', 'urppp,' and 'yunk'. 'Let me through, I'm Tabitha's father,' said Tabby's Dad. The crowd of cameras and hunched men turned to him. 'Mr Blatt, how do you feel about Tabitha getting through to a final interview for Head Laugher?' said one of them. 'You must be very proud!' It was then that Tabby saw her step mother, beside him. Her nose seemed to be shrivelling in disgust, as though it had smelt an extremely bad smell, and wanted to drop off. 'Yes,' her Dad said. 'She's very special to me.' He looked at Tabby. 'We don't deserve her.' Ginormous Gymnast Leaps into Interview 'Say if you don't want to go.' 'I'll go,' said Tabitha. She sat in the front of the car and watched the newspaper-sign outside the corner shop, as it passed by. It said, in black, 'Ginormous Gymnast Leaps into Interview.' 'Look, Tabby,' said her Dad. 'I know we've pulled you all round the country. It hasn't been fair on you. If you didn't want to do this, I'd understand.' Tabitha looked at him and he smiled at her, and she smiled back. 'They'll all be there,' she said. By all; she meant the Headmistress, the teachers, the children, and the cameras. 'I have to go.' He indicated and turned into the school car-park. As he braked, the electric motor whined. There was bunting tied to the overhang at the edge of the car park, and a large, canvas sign, with the words 'Congrats Tabby Blatt!!' in blue on white. Below it, stood a line of teachers, each looking as nervous as the next as a camera filmed them. The Headmistress stood at their centre, her fingers twitching as if grasping for something she had dropped. She was wearing a flowing, ruffled dress and a tense expression. The disabled parking space had been framed by cones and, over the yellow person in a yellow wheelchair, there was painted a smiling, happy face, like the ones on the whiteboards. As her father stopped the car on it, Tabitha thought; I've never been on the happy face, before. Tabby un-clicked her seatbelt, opened her door and, as she rose from the car, the Headmistress cuddled her and laughed, and said, 'Well done, Tabitha Blatt!' The teachers clapped. (Mrs Wilbur harder than the others.) As the cameraman walked toward the car, the Headmistress said, loudly, 'The children are all in the hall, and they're really excited to see you.' Then, through her teeth, she added, 'And we'll have no funny business from you today, Tabitha Blatt.' Tabby smiled and waved goodbye to the line of teachers, who joined her Dad in following the cameraman. Year Six children were lined up from the front door, down the corridor to the canteen, and from there to the Hall. Susan was one of them and she applauded like a zombie who had mostly forgotten what hands were for. She missed them on several of her claps and looked, as Tabby passed, as though she might lunge at her. Instead of doing this, she made a strange, sucking sound ' the kind of noise a person would make, thought Tabitha, if they were swallowing their own tongue. The hall, when they got there, was a cacophony of glee. The younger children, having no idea of what the Giggle Factory was, or of its importance, or of Head Laughers, or how to sit still for longer than three minutes, were trying to crawl toward the plastic chair at the front of the hall. This was where Tabitha was supposed to sit. The ceiling was strung with a banner saying 'Tabitha Blatt'' and behind it, but lower, '' for Head Laugher'. Tabby spotted a rope that led to between the banners, and the fact that it was tied to a gym-hook on the wall. She saw - as she looked up ' the round bottom of a bucket, visible between the banners like that of a fat child playing hide and seek behind a lamp-post. Tabby, however, pretended not to notice. Mrs Wilbur went to stand by the end of the rope, her cheek-muscles clenching and relaxing as her hands did. Waving and bowing as if this was an act and she was in play, Tabby allowed herself to be led to the blue, plastic school-seat. She didn't look at Mrs Wilbur, but knew the teacher's hands had moved to the hook, and the rope tied around it. Tabby sat. The Headmistress pushed out her hands as if bouncing two basketballs, and said, 'Shusssh,' as the cameraman took his position, to the right of the children. Eventually, the shouting of teachers and the screaming of children quietened. 'Weeeell'' said the Headmistress. '' We are very lucky to have Tabitha Blatt back with us today. Now that she's a celebrity.' The children screamed excitedly as she said 'celebrity'. Tabitha stared out across the cross-legged, clapping, yelling pupils. She remembered the school phoning her Dad and asking for Tabitha to come in, even though she was still suspended, because the news company was visiting. Tabby smiled, and nodded, and waved. Tabitha watched Mrs Wilbur untie the rope, and pretended not to watch. 'And,' the Headmistress pointed at", "label": 1}
{"text": "Tabby, 'I wanted to say a very special 'well done' to Tabitha Blatt for getting an interview at the Giggle Factory.' She clapped. Her hands were wet with sweat and made a slapping sound, rather than a clapping sound. 'And finally,' said the Headmistress, walking to Tabby, while glancing across at Mrs Wilbur, 'I don't know if all of you know, but Tabitha Blatt was already famous in this school'' 'Infamous,' Tabby could hear a nearby teacher mutter. '' for her funny sense of humour, and her practical jokes. The amount of times we have sat in the staff room, and laughed at what she has done. And laughed'' When she said the second 'laughed', her right cheek twitched, but not her left. The Headmistress looked at Mrs Wilbur, again. Mrs Wilbur held the rope. Her knuckles were white, as were her teeth, where Mrs Wilbur was grinning. The teacher's cheeks and fingers had gone red. 'Tabitha Blatt - I just wanted to shake your hand' and give you something back,' said the Headmistress, standing near to Tabby's chair, but not next to it. The Headmistress thrust an arm toward Tabby. It was straight. Tabitha began to rise, politely, to take her Headmistress's hand' to shake it. 'This is a present for you, Tabitha Blatt. From the staff of your school'' The fingers ' hers and the Headmistress' ' touched. The Headmistress nodded to Mrs Wilbur. Mrs Wilbur let go of the rope. It hissed as it snaked through the air. Tabby pretended to trip as she rose from the chair. She fell on the floor. As she fell, she pulled the Headmistress toward her. On the floor, Tabby looked up. There was a black bucket above her head, and it was tipping. Something sticky was slipping out. Not only was it sticky, but it also looked icky. Quickly, she slid beneath the Headmistress' wide, flowing dress. From beneath the Headmistress, Tabby didn't see the bucket turn upside down; or what was inside it being turned out into the air. (She didn't even look up, having never seen her Headmistress' underwear before, and not wanting to do so now. It was enough to know how hairy her legs were.) There was a sploshing sound, and a splatt! Tabitha guessed that the bucket had held gunge. Tabby guessed the gunge had belly-flopped onto the Headmistress' head. She watched the red and green gloop as it dribbled off the hem of the dress and onto the hall floor. Tabby got out from beneath the Headmistress, stepping lightly through the puddle of gunk. The hall was silent, except for breathing, and the slow drip-splat-drip of dribbling gunge. Her Headmistress was staring at the ceiling, as though she had just spotted the black bucket hanging above her. The bucket was upside down, and empty. Then, she lowered her red and green spectacles to stare in the direction of Mrs Wilbur, who had gone white. For a change, Mrs Wilbur didn't look angry. Abruptly, the Headmistress began to chuckle and the hall filled with the sound of laughing, small children. Tabitha bowed, and the giggling Headmistress hugged her, and kissed her face, leaving patches of red and green all over her lips and cheeks. 'Good luck, you naughty, little girl,' the Headmistress whispered in her ear. 'Make us proud. Save us all.' The War of Independence Declares Tabitha sat behind the sofa and stared at the picture of her mother. She didn't keep the photograph, here, in the damp-spotted space behind the settee ' she kept it in her pocket. She sat in the shadows behind the settee because it wasn't easy to find privacy in a one bedroom flat when the lounge was your bedroom. The picture was of her mother. Her hair was bedraggled, and she wore a lilac and purple swirl of dressing gown. She cradled a newborn baby in her hands. Tabby's Dad was kissing her mother's cheek, but Tabby's Mum had no eyes for him, only for the tiny Tabitha. She - her mother - was staring downward, her head curls of dark brown hair and no sign of a face. Tabitha's couldn't remember what it looked like. The cheeks, the eyes, the nose, the lips ' all hidden from view ' were also hidden from her memories. Tabitha, unable to see her mother, concentrated on herself as a baby. It was hard to believe she had ever been that red. Though the picture made her smile, sometimes, when she stared at it, her eyes would tighten and she would weep. (Tabby thought that was what meant by Laugh until you cry.) She didn't think that was where the spots of mould on the carpet came from. They were there, her Dad had said, because heating was too expensive to put on, except in rasping, dry blasts, and they couldn't keep the windows open in winter, because it became too cold. The air in the flat often smelt like they had cat, when they didn't. The Blatts never had visitors. As she was thinking about how nobody visited, Tabitha was surprised when there was a loud, hollow, imposing knock on the door. Her Dad was out, but he had a key; so it couldn't be him. Her step-mother was in, scrubbing at the same lines of cooker and fridge and freezer she always did, until the metal looked a little crazy, like a mad person's eyes. Her step mother hissed and, hidden behind the sofa, Tabitha stayed quite still, as Joan crossed to the door. 'Who could this be?' she said. 'It's the wrong day for those bloody loan sharks.' Joan peered through the eye hole, gasped and said, 'Just a minute' just a minute.' Her step-mum ran to the bathroom, shouting, 'Just a minute,' over suddenly heaving breaths, and saying, 'Oh no' Oh no,' under them. She could be heard clattering with mascara and lipstick and a hairbrush before rushing back to the door. The knocking had stopped, replaced", "label": 1}
{"text": "by a self-important silence. Joan gasped once, long and hard, as though about to dive into a swimming pool (which was strange, Tabby's step-mother never dived into anything) and opened the door. 'Mr Forturoy-Jones,' she said, extending a hand. (Tabitha could see them in the reflection of the bay windows. It was like watching ghosts.) 'Miss Skinner,' said an American voice. Tabitha wondered why he had called her this, then remembered it was the name she had before she married her Dad, and became a Blatt. 'I'd like to introduce my daughter; Chelsea Forturoy-Jones.' The American voice had the accent Tabby thought an alligator would have, if it had a mouth full of swamp water. It was deep and rich and bubbling. 'Hello, Miss Skinner,' said a piping-young female voice. Tabby couldn't see the girl, but could imagine a curtsy would go with those kind of clipped, educated tones. Tabby had never curtsied in her life. 'Come in, come in. I do wish you had told me you would be coming. This place, I'm afraid, is a complete mess.' 'Oh, don't worry, Joan,' said Mr Forturoy-Jones. 'What counts for me is what a great employee you are. Three times employee of the month in the Rochdale sales district, I understand.' 'Oh, oh, so kind of you to know that, Sir- Mr Forturoy-Jones, I mean, so kind.' This was the first time Tabitha had heard this babbling sound in her step-mother's voice. For some reason, and she was unsure why, it made her feel angry. She decided to stay still, which was just as well, because Mr Forturoy-Jones said, just then, 'And where is the little girl of the hour?' 'Ah,' said Joan. 'Well, I think she's out with her father. He's out at the super' he's getting groceries,' she said and, what was that? Yes, thought Tabitha, she had accidentally slipped into an American accent. 'Ah,' said Joan, recovering her Englishness. 'Please have a seat. Would you like a cup of t' a cup of coffee?' 'Hah-Hah-Hah,' said Mr Forturoy-Jones, with a laugh that could have been made out of words. 'Yes, I never have gotten used to your 'brews'. I'll have a coffee, please, and Chelsea'll have a coca-cola.' The sofa creaked at the side of Tabitha's face. She hadn't been able to tell in the window, but Mr Forturoy-Jones was a well-stomached man and the settee pitched back - when he sat - as though hit by a World War Two shell. Tabitha edged backward, toward the skirting board. Chelsea sat next. She was more like a bullet. 'So'' said Joan, clinking at the cups, and tinkling at the spoons, '' yes, I would have introduced you and young Tabitha if I'd known' Well'' The kettle rumbled. '' I'm sure she'll be back soon, with her'' 'You must be very proud,' interrupted Mr Forturoy-Jones 'Oh, yes, of course. I've known Tabitha most of her life. I practically raised her,' the photo creaked in Tabby's hand as her fingers clenched. 'You know, terrible business with her mother. I'm just glad I was there to provide, you know, a female role model, I suppose. To help, if I can say, to pick up the pieces.' The kettle hissed as if at a pantomime villain. 'There was a lot of pieces.' Tabitha could imagine Joan nodding as she spoke. 'Gosh, you must be close,' said Mr Forturoy-Jones. 'I can only imagine if I left this world , I would want somebody like you, to help things with my daughter, Chelsea.' There was a creeeeaaak as he turned to look at her. 'Yes'' said Chelsea, around the sound of a yawn, '' Daddy.' Glug, glug. The boiled water and cola were poured. 'Getting one for yourself?' said Mr Forturoy-Jones. 'Oh, I will, I will. Yes,' she said, with the clanking of a mug and a glass on the small, coffee table. 'Yes, Tabby and I are very close. Tabby Wabby, that's what I call her.' Tabby's front teeth snapped together. She put the photograph down, to stop her fingers crumpling it. 'Tabby Wabby'' said Chelsea, in the kind of voice someone would say 'you have a fly on your lips', she continued, '' like a rabbit?' 'Yes, oh yes, She's my little bunny. We've always been close.' 'That is good to hear,' said the voice of Mr Forturoy-Jones. 'So many step parents and step children have a hard time of it. Divorce is such a social evil, that is the teaching of my church, anyway. It's so rare to see a child actually benefitting from having a new parent, as young Tabitha has, here. But of course,' he added, in response to the strangled sound of Joan wanting to say something, but not daring to interrupt, 'there was no divorce here, only an untimely and deeply unfortunate death.' Tabitha wondered what deaths were fortunate, and her thoughts were broken off by Joan speaking. 'Yes, yes'' 'Anyway,' said Mr Forturoy-Jones. 'Talking of Tabby Wabby and her amazing success'' Tabitha didn't think they really had been. '' could we just 'pop', as you Brits say, the T.V. on. For Chelsea, you understand. I need to have a chat somewhere a little bit private. Business talk, ya' know. I have a favour to ask, for when your daughter goes into the Giggle Factory. A little favour, for you, and me, and our wonderful cosmetics company.' ''Changing the way we see ourselves,'' said Joan, seemingly automatically. 'Where can we go, that's a little private, Miss Skinner?' He was all surnames again, and businesslike. 'Um' Ah' The bedroom?' 'Ah,' a pause, like someone had farted at a funeral. 'Or' the bathroom?' 'Probably preferable,' said Mr Forturoy-Jones. The settee lunged as he rose and the floorboards jostled each other as Tabitha's step mother and her boss made their way to the bathroom. Joan clicked on the T.V. as she left and it giggled, as the Giggle Factory logo came on. Chelsea, instead, shrieked, as Tabby clamoured up from", "label": 1}
{"text": "behind the settee. 'Are you okay, honey?' Mr Forturoy-Jones shouted. He didn't come to look. Chelsea stared at Tabby as she sat next to her. 'Yes, Daddy,' she said, after a moment. The murmur of Mr Forturoy-Jones resumed, from the bathroom, interrupted, only occasionally by a whispered 'yes' or 'yes, I see' from Tabby's step-mother. Tabby could imagine her vigorously nodding and her make-up nodding with her like a totem pole in an earthquake. 'They're talking about you, you know,' said Chelsea, lethargically tapping at the remote control. 'How can you only have fifty channels? To think Britain used to rule us.' 'I know,' said Tabitha, to the first comment. 'Daddy wants you to take something from the Giggle Factory. He says it's not stealing, but when I took five-thousand pounds from his wallet to buy the new Nintendo Pu, he spanked me and called me a thief. I don't see the difference, I really don't.' Tabitha stared at her. Chelsea had a small head and a body that was going the same way as her father's. 'Five-thousand pounds in his wallet?' Tabitha said. 'Yes, my Daddy is really, very rich. He says he's easily in the top one-percent. He says 'Money makes the world go round'. Where's your bedroom?' 'This is my bedroom,' said Tabby. Chelsea turned to look at Tabitha. Her eyes looked abruptly bigger than her cheeks. 'Oh My God,' Chelsea said, looking around, as if for the first time. 'How do people live like this?' The girl's gaze went to the bathroom door. 'Don't tell him I'm here,' said Tabby. Chelsea smirked. 'Why ever would I do what you say?' she said. 'I live in a mansion and you live in' well, a place like this! My maid servant has more rooms than you do!' 'Please.' 'Daddy! Daddy! Tabitha Blatt's just arrived!' Chelsea's smile wasn't going away. 'Ah,' Mr Forturoy-Jones exited the bathroom with what seemed undue haste for a large-bellied man. The bathroom tiles squeaked, as did Joan, who followed him. There was a hollow look to her eyes, as though her pupils had been scooped out. For the size of him, Mr Forturoy-Jones had lean, hungry cheeks, and narrow eyelids. 'Just the young lady,' he said, grasping her hand and pumping it until Tabby's teeth chattered. 'Well, darn, it's just a pleasure to meet you,' he grinned and Tabitha thought of alligators, again. Tabby's step mother made a nodding action with both her head and her eyes, and small gestures with her hands. Tabitha didn't introduce herself. 'Ah, just a pleasure. It really is something to write home about,' Mr Forturoy-Jones continued. Tabby nodded, but mainly because he was still shaking her hand. 'Well, I won't keep you for long, I'm sure you have to get ready for tomorrow, thinking of how to be funny, and so forth. It was just great meeting you, and me and your step-mum had a good, little chat about what's best for the family. We're a family firm, ya' know, and you're part of that, just like your wonderful step-mum. Don't you worry, she'll fill you in, later, I'm sure.' He let go of Tabitha's hand, which had gone white in lines like when she carried carrier bags back from Tesco. Reaching into his grey, double-breasted jacket pocket he retrieved a gold coin. 'This,' he said, 'is for you. It's gold and worth a thousand pounds. Money makes the world go round, as I like to say. And this is how you tell it's the real thing.' He bit it, leaving the indent of his teeth, and pressed the coin into Tabby's hand. It still had a little dribble on it. 'I know the real thing when I see it,' he added, staring hard at Tabitha. His eyes were small and metallic looking, but their metal was not golden. 'Come on Chelsea,' he said. 'Let's get going. Young Tabby Wabby will have lots of getting ready to be doing, and the hopes of our company are hanging on her.' Joan saw them to the door and stayed there, waving, long after they had disappeared into their limousine, and into the night. The War of Independence Ends Joan pushed her chips around her plate. They looked like lots of yellow Capital Letters. 'Tabby can go into the factory with one person tomorrow?' her step-mum said. 'Because of her age? She has to be accompanied by an adult? Isn't that right?' Tabby Wabby, thought Tabitha, and sawed at her meal, snapping a chip. Her father smiled. He wasn't drinking alcohol, but he swigged at the cola as if he were. 'Yep,' he said. Her step mother put down her cutlery. 'I think I should go with her.' Tabby's Dad stopped eating, his jaw stopping in mid-chew. 'Eh?' he said. 'I think I should go with her,' Joan repeated. 'I'm going with her,' said Tabitha's Dad. He looked at Tabby and Tabby glanced down at her lap. Ever since Mr Forturoy-Jones had left, Tabitha had been waiting for this. Her thoughts felt thick and slow as tomato ketchup coming out of a bottle, and the fish finger in her mouth wasn't helping her get any brainier. She couldn't think of a way to stop this conversation happening. Her father put down his knife and fork, staring first at Joan, and then at Tabby. This was unexpected. By now, he should have been nodding, and agreeing, and kowtowing. Joan's nose seemed to be aware of this, and it reddened, the freckles along it going a deeper, chestnut-skin brown. 'Tabby, do you want me to go with you to The Giggle Factory, or do you want your step mother to?' He asked. Tabitha stared from one adult to the other. Despite normally speaking with her mouth full, she couldn't say anything, now. 'Hang on,' said Joan. 'She can't make that kind of decision. It's too important and she's not old enough. Look, how long is it I've had to direct this family? How", "label": 1}
{"text": "long have I had to wear the pants?..' (Tabby thought Joan had meant to ask, 'How long have I had to wear the dresses?' It must have been a long time since her Dad had. She couldn't remember seeing him in a skirt, at least.) Joan continued, ''I didn't want to have this conversation in front of the child, but it would be better if I accompanied her.' 'You don't want to have this conversation in front of her.' He nodded, once, twice, both nods as fast and short as his breaths were now coming out. 'Then why did you start it?' Tabitha felt herself sinking into her seat, and her heart sinking into her pants. 'Start what? I was just telling you what was going to happen.' 'NO'' her Dad shouted. Tabitha accidentally swallowed the fish finger whole, and tried not to choke out loud. '' IT'S UP TO TABITHA, NOT YOU!' Joan's eyes narrowed, with the effect of making her nose look longer. 'I had a visit from my boss today,' she whispered. She sounded louder than his shouts. 'You know, boss? From having a job? He's going to make me the manager for all of the northern sales district, if I go in with Tabby.' 'So?' said her Dad. Tabitha pretended to eat, staring down at her plate. She felt like she was going to cry onto her chips and didn't really know why. 'So?' Joan continued. 'Do you really think she's going to get this Laugher job? Do you really think this isn't one big mix up? When she fails and comes back we'll still be living here. Maybe with some money from selling her story to the newspapers, but that will run out quickly. We'll be penniless by the time she's in secondary school. Don't you want what's best for this family?' At that moment, Tabitha's Dad did something rather unexpected, and, though Tabitha could not see it, she could feel it. He smiled. Then he rose from his seat and said, 'No I don't. I don't care what's best for this family. I care what's best for Tabby. She wants to go with me and that's what's going to happen. No argument.' Tabitha, contrarily, thought this was the first time she had ever heard them arguing. Certainly, it was the first she had heard him argue back. He walked to the sink and put on the hot water. Joan stared at Tabitha. 'I was always the outsider in this home,' her step mother said and got up. 'I'm going out, don't wait up for me.' Expensiva 'I have to talk to you,' Joan said. 'Alone.' Her Dad wasn't in and Tabitha was still a child, and living under their roof, and knew she would have to what her step-mum said. 'I don't want to talk in the flat, though. Let's go,' finished her step-mother. When Tabby had spent as long as she possibly could getting ready, Joan drove her to the coffee house. Nero and Costa and Starbucks had all closed down during the bad times, and only Expensiva was left, due to its being cheaper than the rest, and having grubby plates, and tea that both looked, and tasted, a little like wee. They didn't sell very much coffee, anymore, except for the house-blend, and Joan ordered a pot of tea while Tabitha sat at a red-rimmed plastic table, shivering inside her duffle coat and mittens. She wasn't only cold. Her step-mother returned, smiling, with the tray, and sat down opposite Tabitha and poured the two cups and said, 'Sugar?' 'Four,' said Tabby. She had only recently started drinking tea, and liked to make it as close to pop as possible. 'We should have talked years ago,' said Joan, staring out of the window. There wasn't much to look at inside the caf', apart from the staff. The only thing to have dropped in price, during the bad times, was alcohol, and the place was empty. The pubs would be full. The cafe did have, though, a television set, courtesy of the Giggle Factory, and on it was a picture of an obese man doing the back flip. When he landed, he wobbled like a sea during a tsunami; in one, long, straight line of fat. 'We've got off on the wrong foot,' said her step mother. She still wasn't looking at her. 'It's my fault, I know. I'm the adult, but sometimes adults don't know what to do, and how to make things better.' Joan glanced at Tabby, then away, again, at the street. A woman was begging. 'I'm not going to steal anything from the factory,' said Tabby, cupping her hands around the teacup, to give her warmth and courage. Joan nodded as though listening to a distant song, and didn't answer, straight away. 'I grew up in the good times,' she said, eventually. 'I didn't know how good they were. I had a nice house and a big garden I used to run around in, and hide in.' She smiled, as though at herself, when she was a toddler. 'We had a big tree I used to climb, even though my mum told me not to. The amount of times I got told off! I used to laugh all the time, my Mum and Dad said. Then the bad times came.' The smile was gone. 'I was an adult, then, and our family lost everything. And I lost my parents. My Mum died only three months after my Dad.' She looked again at Tabby, her eyes sharp - at their edges - as her nose. 'Then, I lost my home. I remember the day the new family came to live in my house. I hid in the garden!' She laughed but the laugh was harsh and short as a magpie's call. 'You don't know what it's like to be an adult, Tabby. You don't know what's coming. And you shouldn't ' you're only a child. You shouldn't'' Tabitha nodded, although", "label": 1}
{"text": "she didn't really understand what Joan was talking about). Inside, all she was thinking was, Your Mum died' Your Mum died... Your Mum died. 'But being an adult's hard. So hard. I slept at friends' houses but friends don't want you to sleep with them forever. Some nights, I had to sleep out in the cold. In buses. In parks. In shop doorways. I can't tell you what that's like. The cold gets into you, into your blood, and into your heart. You end up feeling like a wraith. Do you know what a wraith is?' Tabby, who had seen the dead kings in Lord of the Rings, nodded. 'Then I got my job. And I fell in love with your father. I can't say I fell in love with you, but I don't hate you, Tabitha.' 'It feels like you do,' said Tabby, and was quite unsure how she had managed to do so. Her step-mother paused and stared at her. 'I'm sorry, I really am' You don't know what's going through my mind, all the time. Every day, every night, every second.' 'No'' Tabby shook her head. 'Money. Worrying about money.' Every time she said this, Joan pinched and pulled at the end of her nose, as though for luck. No wonder it's so long, thought tabby. 'Money'' Pinch. '' Money'' Pull. '' Money'' Longer. 'Sometimes the worry burns on my skin like I've poured this tea over me, when it's just been boiled. Sometimes it's as cold as a butter knife in my stomach. I have to keep a roof over our heads, Tabby. I can't go back to sleeping on the streets. Do you understand?' 'I can't steal anything from the Giggle Factory,' said Tabitha. 'Why can't you see that?' Her step mother put down her cup and used the freed hand to grasp Tabby by the wrists. Tabby tried to flinch away, but couldn't. Joan's painted nails did not dig in to her skin, but held her tightly. The mascara around her step-mum's eyes looked old and wrinkled. 'I'm not asking you to,' said Joan. 'You can do whatever you want to do. But please believe me when I say you don't know all about life yet. You'll make whatever decision feels right to you, and that's fine. All I'm asking, all I'm begging you to do, is to make the right decision' whatever that is.' She looked back out of the window, now, and she was crying silently. 'I don't know what it is. I really don't.' Tabitha reached out and grasped her step-mum's other arm and they held each other, momentarily. They would have cuddled but for the red-rimmed, grey, plastic table between them. There, in the coffee shop, her step mother seemed to have a shorter nose, and softer eyes. Tabby felt teary herself and her eyes blurred and the sight of her step-mum reminded Tabitha of what she could remember of her mother's face. Then, Joan whispered to Tabby. She talked about Mr Forturoy-Jones. She said he'd told her about a rare, powerful object that made the Giggle Factory work. He didn't say what it was ' he didn't know - but he wanted Tabby to steal it. 'I'm not saying do it,' Joan finished. 'But just think about it, and decide at the time. If you do take it, Mr Forturoy-Jones said there's a rubbish chute in the basement. Put this secret object in with the rubbish, and flush it away, and he'll do the rest. Do you understand what I'm saying, Tabitha?' Tabby nodded, but didn't say anything. Later, Tabitha was tucked up in bed, which is to say ' in settee - when her Dad bent and kissed her on the forehead. 'Try to get some rest,' he said. 'Big day ahead.' Tabby smiled back. Normally she would have said something funny, and her father would have said 'smart Alec' and Tabitha would have said, that's not my name, your only daughter and you think I'm a boy! But tonight, she didn't feel she had a funny bone in her body, except in that all her bones felt like they'd turned to jelly, which was a very strange feeling indeed, but not funny funny. Her Dad turned off the light and Tabitha stared at the ceiling. Tabby thought of the photograph of her mother, but it was in her jean's pocket. She held onto it, instead, with her mind, and thought about her mum, until her thoughts misted, then fogged, and she drifted off to sleep. Part Two The Big Day Maybe it was because he was trying to see through the snow - craning his back and neck ' but Tabby's Dad looked taller when he sat in the driving seat. Normally, riding alongside Joan, he was the passenger, and would sink, as though not wanting other men to see him. This morning, Joan (the make-up on her face glowing orange against a sky of falling snow) had let him drive. 'How are you feeling?' Joan said, turning to smile at Tabby. Tabitha stared; she wasn't used to seeing her step-mother's head this way round in the car. They didn't talk, here. For the first time, beyond the make-up, Tabitha thought her step-mum was pretty. 'Scared,' Tabitha said. 'You'll be okay.' Tabitha nodded to stop Joan seeing her gulp. Her chin covered her throat at just the right time. Joan smiled, her lips bright and red as the neon words on the side of the Giggle Factory, which could now be seen, beyond the snow and the traffic. As her step mother turned back, Tabitha said, 'Uh, Joan?' The head returned and, with it, the smile. 'Yes?' 'I want you to keep this for me.' She held out the golden coin Mr Forturoy-Jones had given her. The smile disappeared. Joan stared down at the money and didn't take it. 'Does this mean you've made your decision, already?' 'No,' said Tabitha, quickly. 'I want you to have it,", "label": 1}
{"text": "just in case. In case you need it. In case you run out of money, again.' Joan's eyes narrowed. Most of the time, when they did this, they were staring at Tabby, or at a mess she had made. This time, it was at the coin. There seemed to be a tug of war between her pupils and the round metal. Eventually, Joan took the money. 'I'll keep it safe for you,' she said. 'Thank-you,' said Tabby. Tabitha's Dad glanced at Tabby in the rear view mirror, then indicated and pulled in, stopping the car beside the front of the Giggle Factory. In front and behind them, black taxis and long limousines formed a line of cars in the snow, like liquorice on icing. An official looking man in a suit slipped in the newly laid snow, as he tried to wave her father away. Behind them, a BMW beeped and its driver waved frantically at them to move on. 'They don't know who you are,' said Tabby's Dad, looking at her in the rear view mirror. 'We better get out, that man looks cross,' said Joan. 'This car doesn't really fit in. Well, it does fit in, but only because it's smaller than all the other cars,' said her Dad, laughing to himself. Tabby wasn't listening; she was looking at the snow, which was no longer settling. The snow-shower was more of a snow-drizzle, now, and she stared at one flake, which had started fluttering upward. It was joined by another, near-identical one, which made them look like a pristine, white butterfly, flapping as it rose into the sky. 'No two are the same,' said Tabby, watching the flakes. 'Sorry, sweetheart?' said her Dad. 'I'm ready,' said Tabitha. She got out and hugged Joan, who hugged her Dad, and then her step-mum slipped into the driving seat, as Tabitha and her father walked, unnoticed, toward the crowd that had gathered at the Giggle Factory gates. The Final Interview A line of neon letters stood under the TV screen on the factory wall. In letters big and orange and yellow as Alphabetti Spaghetti for giants, it said, 'The Giggle Factory; We Make You Laugh'. The gates to the factory were high and topped with spikes, which, in turn, were mounted by gargoyles, who looked really quite uncomfortable. On the roof of the factory was a single tower. All of this (the letters, the screen, the gate, the gargoyles, the tower) was useful, as, without them, Tabby would have been unable to see the factory. Before her, a crowd was doing what crowds do best; which is attracting more people, and noise, and attention. The way to the factory gates was kept open by a corridor of police and, between them, two bobbing lines of dignitaries. Politicians and royalty and reality-TV stars, and news presenters. One of them was talking into a microphone, and at a camera. 'And they're here, all three of the interviewees, with their parents and guardians,' the reporter said. She was bustled, from behind, by the back of a policeman, and kicked at his calf with her high heels. Tabitha could here a scream higher than the heels, and the reporter resumed speaking, 'Billy Hiccup, with his agent, Charlotte de Vintri.' A grinning Billy Hiccup (looking as he did on T.V., but shorter) waved at the crowd with two hands clasped above his head and, beside him, a woman with a red-tinted bob of hair and a suit powerful enough to power the entire Giggle Factory smiled, and waved as though she were the royalty. The crowd yelled. Billy's grin had a second layer of teeth that was made out of the gum he was chewing, and was fat and crinkled. Tabitha thought of what Mrs Wilbur would say, and reckoned that much gum would fill a small bin. The news presenter continued, 'Then there's the Ginormous Gymnast, and his father, Sir Peasbody.' A moustached man in a Great Britain tracksuit, whose face seemed to be cut from the same starched cotton as the collar of his sports-jacket, nodded briskly. His bald scalp was as shiny, and must have been as regularly buffed, as the three gold medals that hung about his neck. Tabitha recognised him from T.V. pictures of famous athletes. He looked older, and balder, than she remembered. His son ' a teenage boy who was also dressed in a tracksuit, but without the medals - muttered something which may have been, 'I'm not ginormous' but could not have been, because he was. 'And finally, the youngest interviewee, rated by the bookmakers as least likely to be hired, Tabitha Blatt and her father, whose name is'' the news-reporter read from a creased, coffee-splatted piece of paper, '' 'Dad'.' The crowd went wild, which is to say; it didn't change at all. Then, it hushed. The gates were opening, quiet as slipping on satin slippers; with just the same hiss. Professor Floghorn stood there, like a slip of shadow that had spent too long under the stairs, and gone quite mad. He wore a City banker suit and a sartorially-astute burgundy tie with light blue, diagonal lines. In his breast pocket there was folded a white handkerchief with the merest touch of blue, which both complemented his tie, and matched the dark lustre of his suit. His shoes were suede and, Tabitha could hear Charlotte de Vintri say, as she stared at them, 'Hmm, Italian, very nice'. It was at the immaculate collar-line of his shirt that everything went wrong. His head was entirely unsuitable. From the neck up, Professor Floghorn had the features of a very ordinary boy who had grown into a very ordinary man and then, unfortunately, gone completely mad. He had hair that was redder than an exploding sun. The follicles of it seemed stapled to his scalp and, in places, appeared to have worked their way free and hovered above his skull, nettled in the hair that was still tacked on,", "label": 1}
{"text": "seeking vertical lift off, or to get as far away from his brain as possible. His eyes were doing the same thing, boggling like they had seen something in his mind that terrified them, and were looking for quick way out. Below his eyes, his lips had the shape of the business end of a trumpet and, when he spoke, he had all the subtlety of a foghorn, and didn't need a megaphone at all. 'Ladies and gentlemen,' he said, and smiled. 'Boys and girls, dogs and cats, lefts and rights, backs and fronts, heads and heels,' he glared about and his eyes inched a few millimetres further out of their sockets, 'Oh, I'm sorry,' he said, to the Ginormous Gymnast, and his father, 'thicks and thins.' Sir Peasbody went red and his son went pale. (Tabitha wondered how they could be related.) 'Did he just call me stupid?' asked the track-suited teenage boy. 'Welcome to this,' Professor Floghorn swept his arm back, 'the end of my hand,' he wiggled his fingers and grinned. The crowd stared. The Professor's grin became more of a grimace. A teardrop slid down his right cheek, in nervous, furtive jerks, as a mouse would across a cattery floor. In the crowd, a couple of people laughed, and then two more. Tabby had never heard nervous laughter before, but now did. It seemed to only happen in crowds. On the factory wall, the immense neon letters fizzled and winked. Suddenly, the 'M' and the 'Y' and the 'o' hissed and went out, turning the sign into 'The Giggle Factory; We .ake ..u laugh'. 'Oh God, it's like turning up to see Jesus walk on water, and watching Him drown,' said Billy Hiccup, just loud enough for the laughter to turn from nervous to sniggering. 'Ah-ha, so'' Professor Floghorn - who either had not heard, or did not want to - grasped the right hand of Billy Hiccup, and the left hand of his agent, Charlotte de Vintri. 'No time to waste, no time to shake.' He glanced at the line of famous people and let go of Billy and Ms de Vintri. 'High fives instead?' he asked, of the first dignitary; the prime-minister of Britain, who smiled, as if someone had pressed a 'grin' button on his back. The prime-minister raised his hand. Professor Floghorn ran along the line, hi-fiving. Most of the dignitaries had not yet realised he was going to do this, and were roundly slapped in the face. 'Your turn, your turn,' shouted Professor Floghorn, gesturing, and Billy followed, slapping the prime-minister 'who had turned to see if the professor was talking to him ' across the back of his well-groomed hairstyle. The Ginormous Gymnast went next, and most of the dignitaries ducked. 'Well, I guess this is it,' said Tabitha's father. 'Got to say I'm relieved. Don't like crowds too much.' His eyes looked sweaty and Tabby realised this was the fault of his forehead. She smiled. 'Let's go, Daddy,' she said, and arm-in-arm with her father, they entered the grounds of the Giggle Factory. The prime-minister whimpered as they passed. Inside was well lit, as you would expect from a power station, until the lights began to fizzle. They resumed brightly, and the three applicants, and their three wards, looked not at the electric bulbs hung from the ceiling, but at the professor. 'If you could stop here, please,' he said. His eyes were heavy. Perhaps they were thinking of jumping off his cheek-bones, thought Tabby, and then wished she hadn't. The image did her nerves little good. It wasn't only being in the final interview, nor being in the highly secretive Giggle Factory, that frightened her nerves so much. It was that, whatever room she stood in, be it a classroom or a living room or a toilet, Tabitha Blatt was used to being the funniest person there. That was her thing. Funny was Tabby. Now, she glanced apprehensively at Billy Hiccup, who chewed confidently, like a gum advert. He knew he was funnier than her. He also knew she knew he was funnier than her, and Tabitha didn't know what to do with that knowledge. It was as if she had ceased to exist and a shiver ran through her and she thought of the wraith her step-mum had become, when she didn't have a home to sleep in. Standing next to her father, Tabby felt cold and alone. 'Ah, so, welcome to the Giggle Factory.' The professor opened his arms. There were sweat patches underneath them. Somehow the liquid had made its way through the jacket he wore. Under the lights, which were bright and glaring once again, Tabitha could see scratched, fingertip-lines leading up his forehead to his hairline. Now, she could tell why some of the strands of it had come loose; he had torn them out. Now, she knew why his eyes were looking for a way out. Tabitha shifted closer to her father, who did the same to her, and they staggered as they bumped into each other. 'It looks like an airport,' said Billy Hiccup. He breathed smoothly before saying, 'You know those scanners at the airports, where you go through, and everybody can see you naked, on the screen. Why,' he smiled a tooth line of gum. 'They're my favourite thing. I bought a freshly baked gingerbread-man and put it in my front pocket. This woman security guard was looking at the screen and'' here, Billy looked at Tabby, '' instead of seeing my naughty bits, she saw a smiling, waving gingerbread-man. My, that security guard - she did scream, and scream '' 'Oh, he's so funny,' interrupted Charlotte de Vintri. 'The funniest! The most funniest!' 'Master Hiccup,' said Professor Floghorn. 'I do already know how funny you are. I've seen your CV, after all, although I couldn't bear to watch your shows. This isn't a funny competition, you should know, young man.' 'It's not'? Gotta say; I'm confused, mister.' A", "label": 1}
{"text": "lump of chewing gum fell from his teeth and clumped on his lower lip. 'No it isn't, and, young man, I must remind you that I am not a mister.' Billy Hiccup blinked. 'I'm a professor.' 'Oh,' said Billy. 'A slight error of judgement'' said Charlotte de Vintri, '' he really is the nicest boy. The niciest. The most niciest.' 'Oh, please,' Sir Peasbody drawled. 'You make me laugh more than he does.' 'Oh, stuff your medals where they won't gleam,' said Billy. 'Old man.' 'So,' Floghorn's lips quivered as his voice boomed out. 'Billy Hiccup, you were quite right. This thing'' Professor Floghorn walked up to the metal portal; a doorway without walls. '' is a scanner.' 'Oh, yes,' Charlotte de Vintri said. 'You can't be too careful. Security and all that.' She waved her hand as though doling out sweets to children. 'Such an important place'' 'Yes, indeed. And there is one thing so very dangerous to humour, that we can't let it in.' 'Yes; bombs'' said Charlotte de Vintri. She placed a manicured hand to lip-sticked lips. 'Can I say 'bombs' here? I don't mean to raise security concerns.' 'No, not bombs,' said the professor. 'Sarcasm.' 'Sarcasm?' said the Ginormous Gymnast. 'Sarcasm?' said Billy Hiccup, crinkling his nose contemptuously. 'Oh, yes. Sarcasm is very dangerous to real humour. A sarcastic laugh. Oh, I couldn't imagine the effect that would have, in the Giggle Factory. Oh, my, it would just kill the spirit of all the giggles in the building. We'd have to fumigate.' Billy Hiccup's lips turned in on themselves, and stuck to his teeth. 'So,' continued the professor. 'If you'd just like to continue through the sensor, any sarcasm you may have hanging around- unwanted, no doubt- inside you brain, will be taken out.' Floghorn clicked his fingers. 'Taken out?' said Tabitha's Dad. He bent over and stared upward. He seemed to be looking for scalpels, or a chainsaw, perhaps, underneath the metallic arch of the scanners. 'Don't worry, utterly harmless procedure. It uses superheated lasers. Master Hiccup, would you like to go first?' Billy blinked again, then shrugged, and walked through the metal doorway. He stopped and flinched, as red, scorching, hissing laser beams shot from the scanner. The laser beams scoured Billy's scalp. Steaming slightly, with bald patches where the beams had been, he staggered to the other side. 'Oh, this professor guy is just so sane,' said a voice that came from the sarcasm scanner. 'Sarcasm scanner? That's such a normal, sane thing to believe in. Not loony tunes at all. Oh, no, this isn't a waste of my important time'' Billy grasped his skull. His fingers hissed slightly on his skin, like sausages in a frying pan. His eyes were wide and whiter than even his gum. 'Excellent' said Professor Floghorn. 'No doubt feels much better, eh?' he rubbed his hands. 'Ms de Vintri?' 'Um, yes, um,' said Charlotte de Vintri. The professor clasped her shoulder and hefted her through. 'Fizz. Hiss. Argggghhhh,'' said Charlotte de Vintri's head. 'Good god, yes he is just the funniest, isn't he? Not a self important little twoik at all. I so would spend a single minute with that chewing, gap toothed fizzog if he didn't make me a bomb of money,' said the scanner, after she had passed. 'What?' said Billy, still clutching his head, and reeling about the polished floor of the room. 'Are you talking about me? Is that what you think?' 'Lovely,' said Professor Floghorn, and seemed to mean it. 'Sir?' 'I'll go first,' said the Ginormous Gymnast. He walked though the sensors, shrugged, and turned to stare at his father. 'Well, I would expect nothing less,' said Sir Peasbody. 'Our type have no time for anything so shoddy as sarcasm. No truck with it at all, lowest form of wit, and all that'' And he walked toward his son. Pow! Said several lasers. Blast! Responded some more. 'Oh yes, you've been on a diet, I can tell,' said the sarcasm scanner. 'A real diet where you eat less food, and not a diet where you eat more.' 'I have been on a diet,' screamed his son and strode to the wall at the side of the room. He punched this. They ' the metal wall and the teenage boy - both wobbled. 'Ah, oh, ahm,' said Sir Peasbody. 'Excellent, and so'' the professor waved impatiently. Tabitha followed. She was surprised when the scanner didn't go off, but she hadn't had much time for sarcasm, before. Most of her time had been spent laughing, or trying not to. Her Dad went last, and Tabby winced, turning away. She put her hands on her ears, and the world was muffled, momentarily, until her father tapped her on the shoulder. His eyes were sad. 'You didn't need to do that,' he said. He pointed to his head. It was unscorched. She smiled and they hugged. Billy Hiccup opened his mouth. He looked like he wanted to say, 'Touching,' Or, 'the love of a father and daughter, how beautiful,' Or, 'Now I feel all warm inside, that wouldn't be the vomit, on its way up, no, not at all.' But no words filled the minty-fresh mouth. Billy frowned, and went back to clutching his head. There was a door at the other end of the room. On a rack at the side of the door were several cone-shaped foil hats, with what looked to be antler horns stapled and selo-taped to them. 'So, excellent. Now'' began the professor. 'These are the Once Hats. The Giggle Factory has a very strong funny field, which is like a force field but not so good in laser fights.' The interviewees managed to nod, at this. 'Now, the Once Hats are for your first time in. The funny field fills the entire factory, and these hats'' Floghorn tapped the silver material, denting one. '' protect your brain and stop you saying things like 'flibble' and 'rawk rawk', or licking", "label": 1}
{"text": "job.' She's not my mother, thought Tabitha. The Headmistress continued. Her glasses had sharp edges, but her voice was soft. 'Times are hard, and all that. But things were going badly at the other schools, before you left, and I know because I phoned them. Yes, the phones still work, you know, thanks to the Giggle Factory. I had a conversation with Mrs Bridge. Do you remember Mrs Bridge?' Tabitha tried to. She thought it was the one with the cardigans and the odour of damp dogs. 'Suspension was mentioned,' the Headmistress finished. She leaned back and nodded, as though at what she had just said. 'Suspension,' Tabitha repeated, looking out of the window. Tabitha had heard the word before, and it made her think of roads that took her to places she had never been. New schools, perhaps. She liked new schools; for a term, at least. Sometimes; even two. The Headmistress leant forward again. Her right hand was still gripped around the two pieces of plastic, and they poked brown lumps between her fingers. Tabitha thought she heard a squelching sound, but knew she must have imagined it. 'I want to give you a chance, Tabitha. Your Mum and Dad are good people, and it's not fair to call them up, and make them come down here, and collect you. It wouldn't be fair on them, on your Mum and Dad, would it?' 'My Mum's dead,' said Tabitha. The Headmistress's face tightened, shrinking into itself, cheeks darkening like steak on a frying pan. The plastic in her hand creaked as her fist tightened. 'Oh'' she said. 'She's' my step-mother.' Tabitha's voice hesitated, but not from the pain of her mother dying. She didn't normally call her step-mother a 'she'; her step-mother was normally an 'it'. 'Oh, I'm sorry.' The Headmistress' words were quiet. She had that look of guilt that all adults wore, when they had lived, and her mother hadn't. 'She died in the bad times?' the Headmistress asked, quietly. There was a popping noise, as the Headmistress asked this. Pop, it went, as a brown poo shot out of her clenched fist. Crack ' the plastic lump hit the wall, and then' Ping ' the lump bounced off the bin, and skittered to a stop underneath the Headmistress' chair. The Headmistress turned to stare at where the sounds had come from, then raised her fist. She opened the fingers, one by one. There was a single, plastic poo left in her hand, sitting in the middle of her palm. It glinted in the light of the room like the smile of a cheeky child. 'Oops,' said the Headmistress. 'Must have squeezed too hard.' She turned her chair and it creaked. 'Now, where did the other one go?' she asked herself. Her black, leather chair spun above the brown lump. Tabitha tried not to stare at the poo. It was directly under her Headmistress' bottom. 'Did you see where that poo went?' asked her Headmistress. Tabitha shook her head. She no longer felt cold. 'Must have gone behind the furniture,' the Headmistress mumbled. 'Anyway'' she leaned forward, her forehead frowning as she concentrated. Sitting over the brown lump ' and forcing out her words ' her face had the look of somebody going to the toilet. Tabby had to close her eyes, for a second. '' Look,' said the Headmistress. 'You go back to class. And we'll have no more of this silliness, eh?' Tabitha nodded, and opened the door to the office, and left the room. 'And Tabitha'' The girl paused before shutting the door. It felt heavy in her hand. Tabby had wanted to be sent home; her Dad was there, and her step-mother was at work. 'The woman from the Cancer Foundation charity is in school, today. So, I'm too busy for any more of this. Really. I'm sorry about your mother, but really'' The Extra Large Smurf Tabby shut the door and was about to walk down the polished corridor to her classroom when she saw a giant smurf in the staffroom. A smurf is sitting in the staffroom, she thought. For Tabitha Blatt, causing trouble was an itch that must be scratched, and she could not help but turn, and peer. It was not a smurf sitting at the staffroom table; but a large blue-and-white costume. The costume was empty, and sat in one of the soft, tweedy, staff-room chairs. Tabitha looked at the Headmistress' office. A large smile opened up Tabitha's mouth. You could always tell when Tabitha came up with an idea her Dad would have called 'naughty', she would have called 'good', and her step-mother; Joan, would have called 'ignorant', whatever that meant. The smile was as much in her brain as on her lips, and you could see it shining right out of her eyes. Tabby stood by the staffroom door while she thought about the empty, blue costume. She stood straight upright, and stared straight ahead, and kept her lips as straight as a child standing near their Headmistress' office ought to. Tabby was well practised at this. A teacher walked past, the smell of cats heavy on her clothes. Tabitha resisted the urge to hold her nose and wondered what it was with teachers and pets. 'In trouble, again, Tabitha?' said the teacher, as she passed. 'Yes, Miss,' said Tabitha. As she stayed still - considering her plan - a short-haired, young woman walked passed. 'Nipping out for a late lunch,' the woman said, to the glass of the reception. 'Do I need to sign out?' 'No, love' Karen, isn't it?' said someone Tabby could only hear and could not see. 'Don't worry, I'll do it for you.' 'Okay. I've left my costume in the staff room. See you in an hour.' The woman called Karen said, before walking out of the wide, front doors. An hour, thought Tabby. So much could happen in an hour. Tabby turned away from the wall and walked into the", "label": 1}
{"text": "your armpit for luck, and so forth. Think of them as doing the same thing as a hard hat on a building site.' He smiled in a way which he must have thought was reassuring. 'But'' said Ms de Vintri. '' I'm not sure they go with my suit.' 'Oh, just give me one,' said the Ginormous Gymnast. He grasped the hat, and plonked it on his head. 'Ah,' said the Professor. The group stared at the gymnast. Tabitha felt her eyes burning with the itch to giggle. 'Um,' said Sir Peasbody. 'I'm sorry,' he added, and bent over, giggling at the sight of his son. Billy Hiccup began to guffaw. 'What? WHAT?' shouted the gymnast, his stapled horns jiggling. 'Ah,' said the Professor, and lifted his left hand so he could smile into it. 'Ah, ah, ah,' he repeated, and Tabitha realised it was the sound of him laughing. He laughed as a lady would, in proper society. The laughter did not reach his eyes, but maybe because they were always on the move, and the laughs couldn't catch them. 'Well, you all put them on, then,' said the Ginormous Gymnast. He stared at the professor. 'Why are you laughing? I thought these were for safety!' 'Ah, no. I'm sorry. My little joke. Once Hat. Dunce Hat. I'm sorry, but they just look so funny'' He stopped laughing. His mouth closed and his eyes grew wider. 'I made them back when I was still funny...' His voice cracked on the last word. '' Once upon a time.' The Ginormous Gymnast wrenched off the hat and stomped on it. 'Ah,' finished the professor. 'Onwards'' The next room looked much as Tabby's classrooms at school looked. Not one for the younger children, where they sat on the carpet, but like a year six classroom. There were yellow tables and chairs and a whiteboard, a projector, and a laptop. Tabitha stared at the tiny computer. She had never seen one smaller than the size of an Ogre's lap (or that of Mrs Wilbur's). Since the bad times, homes and meals and bank balances had all shrunk, and computers and wrinkles and crime rates had grown. 'If you could take a seat,' said the professor. 'I'll just get the slide-show ready.' He hurried to the front of the room. Billy Hiccup sat at the back of the room, and put his feet on the desk in front of him. 'Nearly ready, nearly set,' said Floghorn. Tabitha sat near the front, on the opposite side of the room to the Ginormous Gymnast. Their seating positions reminded Tabby of when she had eaten with her step-mother, in restaurants. She looked across at the Ginormous Gymnast, who was glaring away from his father, and so looking in her direction. Despite the red colour that had collected on his cheeks, and flooded down to his neck, he smiled at her; a small, sweet smile like a confused Nursery child. Tabitha smiled back and then looked at the front of the room, as the professor said, 'Right' lights off please.' He clapped his hands delicately and there was a Click behind the interviewees and the room went dark. In the shadows, Tabitha could hear the pitter-patter of tiny feet approaching the laptop, and a jingling, and a low growling. Professor Floghorn stood beside the whiteboard, an unwrapped cucumber in his hand. He pointed the cucumber at the board. 'First slide!' he said. There was a hissing noise in the darkness beside the laptop, and a Click. A picture of a car appeared on the whiteboard. 'A car,' said the professor, needlessly. 'Four doors, good safety figures, nought-to-sixty in less than ten seconds. Only one decade ago this was the ruler of the world. And this' slide!' A hissing sound. A grumble. Click. 'A human.' The picture was of a middle-aged man, balding, briefcase in hand, tears in his eyes. 'The slave of the car. The car demanded all of the man's money and demanded to be fed every week, at this, slide!' 'Grrrrrr,' said a small voice. Click. 'The petrol station. Where the car would be fed with oil, and the man would stroke the car until it gleamed. Last slide!' 'Hisssss.' Click. A picture of the same man, but lying down, and pretending to be dead. 'I said, 'Last slide'!' 'I hate you,' said a small voice. Click. Click, went the laptop. The picture of the balding, brief-cased man had returned. Professor Floghorn resumed, 'The man was told. 'Stop feeding your car, or the whole world will run out of oil and you will die.' But the man'' the professor hit the picture of the man, with the cucumber, '' did not listen. He was scared. He was afraid of what the car would do, if he did not feed it. He thought it would leave him. He needed the car. Without the car, other men would laugh at him. Then' the world ran out of oil! The slide of the man when he's dead.' 'What a surprise,' growled the small voice. Click, click. The picture of the man lying down returned. 'Many people died, men and women and children.' Tabitha clenched her teeth to stop tears forming in her eyes. Her father's plastic chair creaked as he tensed. 'Next slide!' Click. 'There was rioting and panic and murder.' On this slide, there was a picture of a daisy. 'This isn't the slide I asked for,' said Professor Floghorn. 'This isn't in my job description, is it?' asked the small, vicious voice. There was the tinkle of a bell as whatever spoke shook its head. 'Oh, no, it isn't,' it answered itself. 'Next slide!' A picture of Professor Floghorn appeared. On the screen he appeared to be several times taller than he actually was and towered over a crowd of celebrating people. A golden light shone around him, and his eyes seemed to have lightning bolts coming out of them. 'Ah; I made this slide.' They watched", "label": 1}
{"text": "as Professor Floghorn glared off to the side. At what, Tabitha couldn't tell. 'Then I came along,' said the professor. He hit the image of himself, with the cucumber. 'Me; the saviour of mankind. I invented a way to make electricity from people's laughter. I saved the world. Next slide!' Click. The picture of a jubilant crowd, laughing and crying (with joy) in the street, and other general happiness, including; a baby dancing, a woman laughing, and an old man inserting golden coins into his nostrils. 'That is how the Giggle Factory came to be. Little you lot care about it'' There was pause, the kind of thick swollen silence that made Tabby's heart want to stop and join in. 'Next?' asked the malignant, little voice. 'And now, here I am, standing in the dark, hitting a whiteboard with a cucumber, all sucked dry by you people,' continued the professor. 'And does anyone care. Anyone? I've wasted my best years on this lot of ungrateful wretches, and, now my humour's run out, I'm nothing. Dispensable' Replaceable'' 'Next?' repeated the voice. 'Yes,' said Professor Floghorn, heavily as if he had been given the date and hour he was going to die, and was reading it aloud. 'Next.' Click. The Giggle Factory appeared on the whiteboard. 'Now,' said the professor, brightening. 'I must read some safety notices, for your time inside the Factory. First, if there is a fire, don't run toward it, or try to put it out, or ask it to dance. Also, I do need to tell you where the fire exits are. In the event of a fire, please use the doors. Do not use the walls, or' Slide!' Click. The picture of a burnt skeleton. 'If there is a bomb alarm, please put your fingers in your ears' Not because of the noise of the alarm, but because bombs are very loud. Next Slide!' Click. The picture of a burnt skeleton, but with its bony fingers pressed to the ear sockets of its skull. 'And, finally, at times, in the Giggle Factory, you will experience dizziness and nausea from chuckling too much. Do not worry, this is perfectly normal. All we would ask, for health and safety reasons, is that you do not vomit on the floor. My workers might slip on it, and then where would we be? Please, instead, puke into your pockets and, when these are full, into your underpants. Last slide!' The picture of the balding, brief-cased man returned. His trousers had a damp stain on the front, and brown liquid was seeping out of his jacket and his briefcase. His cheeks looked green and he looked embarrassed. 'And that's the last slide. Lights!' Another Click (but, this time, from the wall), and the sound of a door opening. As Tabitha's eyes got used, again, to the light, she thought she saw a small figure leaving the room by a door opposite to the one they had used on the way in. The group stared at the professor. 'What?' he said. 'Oh, yes; I was giving the talk. Well, ah; it's this door,' he finished, pointing at the one the small figure had used and, with the screech of chair-legs, they rose to follow him into the factory itself. On the inside, the Giggle Factory was bigger than Tabitha had imagined it would be. As when they split the atom, and the explosion went out and out, until it became an atomic bomb; the factory was a hall of banging and of light, and left Tabby's eyes feeling like they had been burnt into the door behind her. She could concentrate on only one thing at a time, and was glad when the Professor led them to a large, churning, green machine. 'This is where we make the self raising puns,' he said, as though they were aware they did. 'This place is huge,' whispered Billy Hiccup. Charlotte de Vintri's power suit seemed tighter on her body as she breathed too quickly. Tabitha continued to feel dizzy. Her Dad had the look of a rabbit caught in a headlight, as though he couldn't work out how he had managed to get inside the light's plastic cover, or why he was travelling at seventy miles per hour. Professor Floghorn tapped the green metal at his fingertips. 'Ah-hem, bit rude, you know, not paying attention, and all that. This may not be your standard interview, but, well, I do have standards, and politeness is one of them.' 'What is this place?' said the gymnast, in a whisper. 'Are they elves?' said his father. 'This is the Whole Floor, where we, as often as possible, aim to produce whole-bellied laughs, in order to power the Giggle Factory. Everybody has their own, personal sense of humour and the factory floor is divided into different departments, each producing a different kind of humour. And'' At this point, he pointed at the far wall. 'It all comes together in the Poo Train.' 'Poo..?' asked Sir Peasbody, bemusedly. 'Sorry, not now,' replied the professor. 'You should have gone before the tour started. Very busy, etc'' They all turned, slowly, stiffly to stare at the professor who ah-hemmed, but was not laughing. 'You are here to prove you have what it takes to be Head Laugher. There will be several challenges in this interview, but the biggest challenge is who you are. There is something about the Giggle Factory that brings out the worst in people. Have you ever noticed, when people are giggling, how cruel - even evil - they can be?' The group stared at the professor in silence and the professor did the same with each of them, in turn. 'And this is your first test,' he said. 'I used to be the funniest man in all the land, but over time, having to be funny drove me mad and now, everytime I try to sleep, I jump up out of bed. Every time I try to laugh,", "label": 1}
{"text": "really laugh, I feel like I'm choking. I can't cry without picking my nose. I wet my bed. Now, if you are going to be funny for a long time, and not go insane like me, you will have to get to know your other emotions. Your fear, your sadness, your shame. To prove they can do this, each of the applicants, Billy, Master Ginormous, Tabitha, must now tell me what they are most ashamed of, in their lives.' Nobody said anything. The factory continued churning and thumping and wap-wap-wapping. Abruptly, the Ginormous Gymnast said, 'I've never won a gold medal. I'm ashamed to call myself a gymnast. I'm the most famous gymnast in the world, but it's only because I look funny when I do back flips and forward flips. I'm scared I will never live up to what my dad wants from me.' From Sir Peasbody's throat came a dry rasp - the sound of paper being slowly torn in two. 'My son, you don't'' 'I'm sorry,' said the professor. 'I only want to hear from the applicants, right now. Perhaps, you could talk later.' He turned his eyes on Tabitha, one eye cautiously following his other. Tabitha opened and closed her mouth and then looked at her father. 'I used to hate my step-mum,' she said. The professor leaned in, maybe trying to hear her over the pounding of machinery, and the sound of sticks being whittled. 'In our last house we had a pet rabbit. It was called Phillip. When I found out we were going to move and I'd have to leave him behind, because there wouldn't be space for him, I took some of his doings, and buried them in my step-mum's make-up pot; the one that was the same colour.' Tabitha turned to her father. 'I'm sorry,' she added. 'I loved Phillip.' She thought that, if not her Dad's mouth, then at least his eyelids would have fallen open in shock. Instead, he seemed to find this incredibly funny, and was laughing. Professor Floghorn turned to Billy. 'Master Hiccup?' Billy Hiccup chewed and put his hands in his jeans pockets and played with something in his right pocket. Eventually, he blurted, 'I'm not ashamed of anything. I've got nothing to be ashamed of. I bring laughter to the world' I'm a genius!' The silence came in again, with its strangeness, like being in the centre of a cyclone, with all the other dangerous, house-tearing sounds nearby. Professor Floghorn then nodded and pointed behind him, to one of those sounds; one which went whump-whump-phart. 'This,' recommenced Professor Floghorn, 'is where we make the self raising puns.' The green machine had a tunnel at the top into which a sack of white flour was gradually emptying. At the machine's far end was a factory line of buns that came out, still hot and, seemingly, rising. On the buns' tops, like x's on crosses at Easter, were letters. 'Self raising buns?' said Charlotte de Vintri. 'Puns,' repeated Professor Floghorn. 'It all begins with this'' he scooped a delicate hand into the sack at the machine's hood. 'Flour. Normal, bog-standard, self-raising flour. If you listen to it carefully, you can hear it chuckling.' He held it out to Tabitha, grinning at her reassuringly. 'Like a baker chuckles, I like to think.' Tabby leant in. The flour did, indeed, laugh like a rotund, hardworking, but content man, who was probably wearing a white apron. Billy said, 'Normal flour doesn't chuckle!' 'But it does, young man,' said the Professor. 'Next time you're in the supermarket, listen to the packets. You might have to listen for a while, and be patient, because their laughter will be muffled by the wrapping. Or, you could unwrap it in the aisle, if it helps.' Billy blinked. He looked, to Tabitha, like an owl that had been slapped. 'Now, professor! You can't expect us to believe'' began Sir Peasbody. 'Yes, now!' agreed the professor, interrupting. 'Now - why do we make the self raising puns? Here,' he had rounded the green machine, and pointed at the factory line. It was dizzyingly long, and many-forked, and all of the lines of slowly trundling puns went into exits in the far walls of the factory. One of the exits was taped over with what appeared, at this distance, to be police tape. 'The monkeys need them when they're writing their books.' 'Monkeys'' said Tabitha's Dad. He turned it into a question. 'Monkeys?' 'Writing books?' said Charlotte de Vintri. 'Well, this one.' Professor picked up a bun, reading its top. 'Says, 'dreamers often lie', that's a pun that means dreamers lie down ' because they're sleeping, but also ' that dreamers don't tell the truth. So, yes, it's definitely a pun,' the professor was now mumbling to himself, 'and a good one' but where's it going?' He followed the factory line on which the pun-bun was travelling, with his finger. Tabitha saw blood under his nails. It was dried and old. 'Mmmm, yes, of course! Well, that's one for the Shakespeare room.' Professor Floghorn replaced the pun and it trundled toward a hole in the factory wall to their left. 'The monkeys may not like that one,' he added, whispering, 'they've had it before, in Romeo and Juliet.' 'Monkeys don't write Shakespeare,' said Sir Peasbody, nasally. His nose sounded blocked by disbelief. 'Shakespeare's dead,' said Tabby. 'Monkeys don't write Shakespeare? Shakespeare's dead?' Professor Floghorn drew up to his full height, and his hair went even further. One strand of it detached and whipped up to the ceiling where it was eaten by a large vent. 'Wrong!' he pointed at Sir Peasbody. 'Right!' he pointed at Tabitha. 'Follow me!' he pointed at the rectangular hole into which the pun had just passed. As he walked, he muttered, 'Everybody knows Shakespeare was written by a room full of monkeys. These are idiots. How did they get to final interview? What's wrong with my human resources department? I'm going to", "label": 1}
{"text": "fire them all!' The group followed, some of them stumbling. When he reached it, Professor Floghorn leant into the exit, and pointed. Jumping so that she could see over his grey-suited back, Tabitha did not listen to all he was saying. She was too busy bouncing and watching decrepit, ancient monkeys stumbling from old fashioned school-desk to old fashioned school-desk, fingers spotted by ink, pages of plays floating through the air, the creak of one larger monkey crying in the corner while ripping up page after page. They were dressed as you would expect monkeys to be dressed, in the court of Elizabeth the First. Several of them were writing what appeared to be a play-script. 'Ohhhh,' said the Professor. 'They've been writing this play for ages. They called it Love Labours Won. Just can't seem to get it right, the poor devils!' One of the monkeys picked up the pun that Floghorn had also picked, read it, squawked, threw it on the ground, and repeatedly jumped on it, until it was flat paste of non-giggling flour. This monkey then collapsed, weeping on the floor, pounding the tiles with its fists. 'Yep, as I thought. Didn't like that particular pun, at all. Poor, poor, tortured, artistic souls,' added Professor Floghorn, as he led them back to the factory lines of puns. 'Let's see if there's a happier one.' He plucked another pun. 'Ah yes.' His trumpet lips turned up, this time; making a 'u' shape. ''Diagonally = Diagon Alley,'' he read. 'Oh, very good. And this one; 'Nocturnally = Knockturn Alley'. Oh, excellent, yes. They must have come from the same, high-grade flour.' The professor stared at the factory line they were on, gaze following its line along to its concluding hole. 'Oh, no, no. Not for Shakespeare, these two.' He plonked them down on another conveyer belt. 'These will go to the Rowling Room. Very happy monkeys in there. Lovely room. Very imaginative.' Sir Peasbody picked up a pun from a different line. ''Ruth'.' He said, frowning. 'A woman's name?' he glanced up at Floghorn,. 'Pick another.' Floghorn waved his hand in a prod. 'Smirched,' said the Sir. 'Ept?' he read, from another, frowning. 'They're bits of words,' said his son, not looking at Sir Peasbody. 'Yes, of course,' agreed theprofessor. 'Ruth is part of ruthless, smirch from besmirched, ept is a bit of inept, and so on and so so on. They are bits of words that don't make sense, on their own. Some monkeys find that funny! Would you believe?' The professor's nose had now wrinkled so much it seemed shorter than his bulging eyes. 'Bad, bad puns, those. They're on the line heading for the Discard Room.' 'They don't go into books?' asked Tabitha. 'Oh, they do. We just make up a lot of pen names, like Kipling, and Archer, and so forth, and churn the books out. Makes a bit of extra money, but not funny books. No, not at all.' 'Why'' said Billy Hiccup. '' is there police tape over two of the monkey-rooms? Some kind of monkey business?' He laughed at his own joke. 'Oh, I would ask you not to laugh about that. Very unfortunate incidents, in those rooms. They were the Plath and Hemmingway rooms. Great producers of books, and very highly thought of, those monkeys were.' He paused. 'Those monkeys killed themselves, I'm afraid.' 'Why?' said Tabby. 'That comes later; I promise.' 'How did they kill themselves?' said Sir Peasbody. 'They're monkeys!' 'The Plath monkeys blew themselves up. The Hemmingway monkeys shot themselves in the head. All suicides. I don't like to talk about it.' 'Look, stop,' said Charlotte de Vintri. 'I'm sorry,' she turned to her charge, Billy Hiccup. 'Darling, this professor is the joke here. This isn't a power station, he's not a genius. I don't know what's going on, but he's just a mad, crazy idiot.' 'Yes,' said the Professor, nodding. 'Oh, yes ' he is! That last bit's true. He's completely nuts.' Ms de Vintri spun at him, her eyes as wide and dark as her shoulder pads. 'What are we doing here, anyway, if you're not even looking for funny people? And are you really a professor, at all?' 'I am looking for funny people. People that make me laugh. I just don't want them to try to be funny.' said the Professor. 'And I am a professor.' 'Okay, then' A professor of what?' said Sir Peasbody. The professor picked up a passing, self-raising pun. ''Fishics',' he read. 'Fishics? That's not a qualification!' said Sir Peasbody. 'I'm a blue sea thinker,' said the professor, who had picked up another pun. 'Dear god,' said Sir Peasbody. 'FISHICS IS NOT A SCIENCE!' 'Ah, but it is. I had exactly the same argument with a dolphin, but what would a dolphin know? He's not a fish!' Sir Peasbody stared at him, pent-lipped. Tabitha didn't know if he was going to pop, or deflate like a balloon whizzing through the air. ''Clicky-clacky-clicky',' the professor made talking actions with his hands. ''Fishics isn't a scientific pursuit. I'm so clever, I'm a dolphin, I've got big brains. Clicky-clacky-clicky.' Still wee where they drink, though, don't they?' Nobody answered. 'Follow me?' the professor asked, helpfully. Tabitha felt quite dizzy; quite utterly dizzy. It wasn't just that the factory was large and brimming with the clank of machines, the scurry of small feet, the whizz of pipes going off, or the cackle of those that had laughed so hard their giggles had scratched their throats. It wasn't just that there was too much going on to put it into her brain and expect her brain to say anything other than, 'you what? And where am I supposed to put all this?'. It was that every part and item and thing on the factory's floor, and in the factory's air was a little less than normal. It was rather like being in the largest fruit and veg' shop in the world, but one where", "label": 1}
{"text": "the bananas were purple and shaped like televisions, the oranges were pink and had the look of settees, and the apples were muttering to themselves, saying, 'I thought I was going to be a pomegranate. How did my life turn out this way?' Tabitha blinked but blinking did no good. The factory was still there when the blink was finished. 'These are the stairs to the Cellar,' said the professor. It was better when he talked. At least, then, Tabitha could focus on what he was talking about. What he was talking about, now, was a wide sweep of mansiony steps that led, balconied, down to the glint of a mirrored hallway. 'This,' repeated Professor Floghorn, 'leads down to the Cellar of Irony. I don't go down there much. I don't really understand irony, except that it changes you.' 'I'm sorry?' said Sir Peasbody. He had been saying quite a lot of this, which, at least, was one up on Tabitha's father, who had taken to saying, 'erm' and 'oh' as though proper words hadn't yet been taught to him. 'The Cellar of Irony,' said the professor, patiently. 'We'll not go down there. The mirrors you can see, in the hallway that leads to the Cellar, are the Mirrors of Changing. Really, rather dangerous are Changing Mirrors. Like the ones in circuses, and at arcades, you know; you walk past them and they change you, in the reflection. I used to be blonde, before I walked through that hall of mirrors.' Tabitha stared at his orange hair. 'We'll not dwell, eh?' Professor Floghorn said, and waved them on. Beyond the stairwell was bench upon row upon bench of workmen, bent over sticks of wood, like carpenters. They were whittling at the sticks, inscribing words, and sharpening them' It was only as Tabitha's bumped into a workstation, causing its occupant to look up and growl (a sound that seemed to happen behind its eyes- approximately in the place where headaches grow) that she realised they were tiny carpenters, and miniature benches. She had thought they were still a long, long way away. 'Elves?' said Tabitha's Dad, seemingly having found the dictionary in his brain. All of the tiny figures wore red sock-hats, with bells on the end. 'Yes, well done!' said the professor. 'They leave me to go to the north pole in December, but the rest of the year around they are here, carving.' 'Carving what, may I ask?' asked Charlotte de Vintri. Professor Floghorn smiled appeasingly at one of the small creatures and lifted a stick from his fingers. The elf glared at him with red eyes. 'Elf whittled witticisms,' said the professor, proffering the stick. 'Look.' The three interviewees and their three guardians lent in. 'I got an ice cream for my kids'' Was carved along its length. The professor turned the wood, careful not to spike himself on its end. 'Best swap I ever made!' it said, written on its reverse. Billy Hiccup made to laugh sarcastically, but only gasped at the air. Professor Floghorn gingerly felt the stick's end. 'This witticism's not very sharp yet' Not very cutting is it?' he repeated, more loudly. The elf he talked to grimaced and made the sound a rat would make, when preparing to throw up, in the back of its tiny throat. 'Needs a little more whittling?' the professor finished. The elf spat on the saw-dust that had accumulated beside his workstation, and grabbed the stick. His fingers, when they went back to work, were a blur. 'They don't look very happy,' said the Ginormous Gymnast. 'Hmmm,' said the professor. 'A high salary, share options, flexible working hours, long maternity leave' there's no pleasing some elves. Ah, let's see this one.' He picked up another stick. 'I love babies'' it said on one said, and, on the other; ''they taste like chicken' Ouch!' The professor had sliced himself on the stick's end. Its whittler grinned up at him with ferrety teeth; small, and pointed, and glinting happily. 'Sharp!' said the professor, looking impressed, before replacing the stick on its bench. He sucked the bloodied finger. 'I've got one!' said Billy Hiccup, his thumbs slipping into his jean's pockets as they did whenever he began a joke. He turned to the Ginormous Gymnast, who had wandered around the side of one of the benches. 'I always knew you were thin'' he said, to the teenager, '' deep down inside.' All of the elves, as one, burst out laughing. The noise of it was a cacophony; the kind of embarrassing sound puppets would make if they didn't care how they looked. The elves' cheeks blushed as red as their jerkins. One fell off his stool and it being a long way down ' elfwise ' must have broken his leg, by the sound of the crack. The Ginormous Gymnast's face was going pale, his eyes sucking the blood from his cheeks. There appeared to be too much liquid, and the eyes began to bulge. 'He just called me fat,' said the gymnast. Billy, who had been laughing along with the elves, stopped, seeming to remember that the Gymnast was a professional athlete. He remembered even more clearly when the Ginormous Gymnast vaulted the work bench and ran at him, fist drawn back. Billy squawked and turned and ran, automatically heading down the stairs that led to the Cellar of Irony. 'Oh, I wouldn't'' said the professor, but he went unheard as the remaining members of the interview group rushed to the balcony, and peered over. Billy Hiccup ran. The Ginormous Gymnast chased. The sound of the gymnast's legs pounded after the lighter footsteps of the comedian's. There was a moment's silence, as they disappeared past the glint of mirrors and into darkness. Then, the footsteps returned, but this time, the heavier one's were in front, leaping up the stairs, two at a time. Then one at a time' then in a stumble. 'Bloody maniac!' said Billy, who appeared at the", "label": 1}
{"text": "top of the stairs. 'He's going to kill me.' The lighter footsteps followed, and had soon caught up. 'Billy!' said Charlotte de Vintri. Her voice sounded like the look of shock they had on all of their faces, except for the professor's. 'There's lots of steps,' said Billy, bent double and gripping his large belly. The Ginormous Gymnast had caught up with him, now, but stopped and turned to stare at the fist that was raised beside his cheek, ready to hit Billy. It wasn't pudgy, but was now thin fingered. He wasn't a very ginormous gymnast, anymore. 'You went past the Mirrors of Changing, didn't you?' said the professor. 'They do have quite a sense of humour, those mirrors.' Still gasping and bent to his hips, Billy grasped at his rolls of stomach. His jean's top button and half of its zip had burst open, revealing a pair of boxer shorts that were straining, and hard, not to rip. 'I'm fat!' he gasped, along with his laboured breaths. 'I'm the skinny gymnast,' said the Ginormous Gymnast staring down at his body. His clothes looked like a skin that wanted to be shed. 'My goodness,' said Sir Peasbody, walking forward. 'My son! Look at your body- it's perfect for being a top-level gymnast.' He touched the gold medals, one by one, that hung from his neck. 'You can be as good as I was, now, with this physique.' The not-so-ginormous-anymore Gymnast stared at his father. 'Father,' he said, 'I never wanted to apply for this job, and I never wanted to be a gymnast.' 'What? What are you going to do, then?' 'I'm going to walk right out of here, and I'm going to be what I've always wanted to be- a teacher.' At this the not-so-gymnast-gymnast-anymore jabbed a long finger at Billy Hiccup, who was leaning on the balcony, which creaked. 'So I can stop people like him, bullying people like I used to be!' With this, the young man turned away from his father, and walked steadily but quickly along the factory floor, and out of the factory by the way they all had come in. Just as he left, there was a disappointed moan of electricity, and the building's lights dulled, dimmed, and went black. At the far end of the room, a red, circular light glowed. Tabitha had time to think; that looks like the eye of Sauron, in that Lord of the Rings film, and to imagine the end of the civilised world, and the coming of darkness, before the factory lights came back on. Professor Floghorn nodded to himself, as if none of this had happened. 'They change you, those Mirrors of Changing. I could never wear leather jackets again, after my hair changed to this colour,' he said. Professor Floghorn whispered when he said, 'And here is where all of our efforts come together- the Poo Train. We get most of our electricity from here.' They stood at the far end of the factory. There was a hole in the wall and a railway going into it, and several carts with metal handlebars waiting to go along its rails ' as you would see at a ghost train in the fair. Lined up beside them, ready to take their turn, was a queue of elves. They grumbled to themselves, or growled at any elf who stood too close, in the line. Queuing, it seemed, was not something an elf would choose to do. 'Most of my employees work on the Poo Train,' said the professor. 'I like to use elves. It's so rare that they laugh but, when they do' You probably know somebody who never laughs, never even chuckles, but then, suddenly; they do. There's no more powerful a sound.' Nobody asked where the tunnel went, what happened in the darkness beyond, or why it was called the Poo Train. Tabitha put her hand in her pocket. She held the picture of her mother as tightly as she could, without crumpling it. 'It's called the Poo Train,' said the professor, 'because it's so funny in that tunnel, that the passengers of the train not only wet themselves with laughter, they also poo themselves and - quite often - pass out. There,' the professor pointed at several green wheelie bins at the tunnel's entrance, 'is where we store the nappies you have to wear, when you go in. And there,' he pointed past an identical series of bins, where the rails came out of a second, distant hole in the wall, 'is the hospital for people who have laughed themselves unconscious.' Just beyond the bins could be seen white walls, and beds. The sound of heart monitors beeping could be heard. 'Sometimes'' he added, in a whisper, ''the train doesn't work, and I can't make anybody laugh, and there's a power cut, and the heart monitors stop working.' He glanced at Tabby. 'Well, I won't say what happens to the patients in that hospital, because there's a child present, but it's messy.' 'I want to go on the train,' said Sir Peasbody. 'Oh, you really don't,' said the professor. 'I do,' he said, and his eyes were as dark as the entrance and exit of the Poo Train. 'He could do with cheering up,' said Billy. 'By the looks of things.' He tried to slide his thumbs into his pockets but his belly got in the way, and he could not. 'Oooohhh-kaaaay,' said the professor, and snapped his fingers. The elves at the workbenches could be seen, like disgruntled dots, sliding back their stools and stomping toward them. They were singing, 'Oh, if he thinks it's a blast, he's having a laugh. He's gonna laugh, Until his guts are passed And his bum's covered in farts,' Singing this, they took Sir Peasbody to behind the bins, stripped him, dressed him in Pampus and, when he re-emerged, he was naked except for his medals and a nappy. They plonked him into a carriage of", "label": 1}
{"text": "the Poo Train, and cranked up the metal pole onto which he could hold, then tied his arms to it, with rope, and his forehead to the back of the seat. 'Can't have him banging it,' the professor narrated, 'when he faints.' With this the elves were huffing, and singing, 'get ready to laugh, get ready to fart, get ready for the dark,' They pushed the carriage as though pushing a car that refused to start, and Sir Peasbody, white-eyed, rolled into the shadows, and disappeared. There was laughter inside the black hole that gradually increased and heightened and lengthened until it sounded like one long scream. Above the Poo train, in the ceiling, a series of metal vents spun and whirred. The elves trundled, shoulders down, to the other end of the tracks, and waited, along with a stretcher, and a defibrillator. 'For restarting his heart,' said the professor. 'Let's go. I wouldn't watch this. It's going to be smelly. Let's go see the fish.' Tabby did not like speaking in front of large groups, unless she was being funny. Now there were five people, and no longer seven, Tabby felt she could ask, 'Why are we here, professor?' 'To see the fish. I just said, young lady.' 'No I mean, why are we here? I mean, if you don't want us to be funny.' 'I see this confusion, yes, I really do. But think about this. I have been Head Laugher for thirty years and I need somebody to be a new Head Laugher. That's why I needed children. I know all of you are funny, but it isn't easy, you know, being Head Laugher for so long. I want to see if you have the patience it takes to keep going, right to the end. That's why I keep giving so many long speeches, like this one.' Tabitha nodded, saying, 'I see, I think.' 'I don't know why you want kids,' said Billy Hiccup, who had managed to get his thumbs into his pockets. 'Children just aren't funny. I've done the research, you know, on my competitors; gone to see loads of kids who think they're funny. There's was this one girl who said; all the wars are caused by adults, and people thought she was hilarious- hadn't they ever read Lord of the Flies? Don't they know what would happen if children were in control of nations. The pigs would be running around with human heads on sticks,' Billy Hiccup grinned, but his lips shook. 'You're not as funny as you used to be,' said Tabitha's Dad, who was beginning to look tired, and irritable as he did when Tabby was sent home from school. Billy's eyes, deep in his new eye sockets, turned to his agent, Charlotte de Vintri. They seemed to be pleading. 'My dear, you're the nicest,' she licked her lips, 'the most niciest, the really best most niciest.' 'YOU DON'T THINK I'M FUNNY ANYMORE,' shouted Billy Hiccup. His forehead was sweating. 'WHAT KIND OF AGENT ARE YOU?' 'You are, darling,' her hands flapped, as if his words were wasps, and she was swatting them away, 'so very very very'' she stared at his stomach. She blinked. Her eyes made her look like she was trying to swallow the word 'fat'. 'GET OUT,' shouted Billy. 'I CAN MAKE IT WITHOUT YOU. I DON'T NEED YOU!' 'No,' Charlotte de Vintri shook her head. Around it, her bob of hair shook in the opposite direction. Tabitha wondered if it was a wig. 'No, darling you can't mean it'.' She fell at his feet, she hugged his right knee, she stared up at him, found she couldn't see his face, and moved back slightly. Billy Hiccup drew himself up to his full height, which seemed a little higher than it had been before. 'I do. I'll make it on my own, now.' Charlotte de Vintri stared for one more final moment then rose, brushed off her knee-caps, and turned to Tabitha. She had a card in her hand without even seeming to reach into her power-suit's pocket. She handed it to Tabitha who was too surprised to refuse it. It said, 'Charlotte de Vintri, professional agent to the professionally funny. No joke too hurtful, no laugh too harsh.' 'Call me, darling,' she said, to Tabby. 'You're the next big thing, and, believe me, there's always a next big thing.' The last she said with a contemptuous look at Billy Hiccup's gut, and flounced out. They reached two metal doors at the far wall of the Giggle Factory. Between them, was a wooden bench. Above the bench was what looked to be an immense set of traffic lights, but upside down. The red at the bottom; the green at the top. This, realised Tabby, was the red, circular eye she had seen from halfway across the factory. At the moment, the traffic lights were on amber, and reminded her of Forturoy's golden coin. Tabitha guessed they went red when all the power was gone. Red suddenly seemed like a dangerous colour. 'Would you sit here, please, Master Hiccup, and Tabby's father?' asked the professor, pointing at the bench. As they did so, the professor opened the first door, labelled 'Professor Floghorn's Office' and beckoned Tabitha inside. She followed. 'This is my office,' the professor said, walking past a wooden, black bunk bed, and sitting on a red bean bag beside a wardrobe. 'Office?' said Tabby. 'I do my best thinking in my bedroom. So I made my office look exactly like my bedroom, right down to the teddy bear on my bed. His name's Barnaby. Don't you do your best thinking in your bedroom?' 'I don't have a bedroom.' 'Oh, that's no good. Would you like one? I guess I'm quite rich. I could make it a present, if you got the job.' 'Thank you, Professor Floghorn, but I don't really think we have room for a bedroom.' 'Oh, I see. What about if I gave you", "label": 1}
{"text": "a seventy-roomed mansion, then you would?.. If you got the job, of course'' Tabby didn't reply. The more the professor said 'got the job' the more she felt lights being turned off, inside her. She stood, in the middle of his fake bedroom, and wearily looked around for somewhere to sit. There wasn't; only somewhere to lie, and she didn't feel comfortable doing that, so she didn't. 'Anywho, I've read your resume.' The professor hunted through a pile of tissues, before finding and waving her disciplinary record. 'You are very mature for your age, Miss Blatt. I was twelve before I became as obsessed with poo, and farts, and wee, as you are now. But they say girls mature more quickly'' He read, 'Recorded the sound of her farting' played it under her chair' yes, ah, ah. Coloured her pants in black, and stuck a plastic poo on the bottoms' Very good. Squirted water onto his trousers, just before the class photos, so his parents thought he had bladder problems' Very funny, indeed. You are good Head Laugher material'' After a silence, Tabby nodded and quietly, because, deep down, she was polite, she said, 'Thank-you.' '' Is something wrong, Miss Blatt?' 'I thought you would ask me more questions. You know; interview me.' The professor's eyes became more serious than she had seen before, and stiller. 'Your actions tell me more about you than your words ever will, Tabby. More about you than you know yourself' You'll see that, by the end of the interview'' She nodded, slowly, and it hid the second time she had gulped today. There was something she wanted to say, but she was both unsure whether she could, and what it was. 'You don't want this job, do you?' said the professor. She shook her head. 'You haven't enjoyed being in the factory. And you think, if you stayed, you'd end up like me. Old and alone and mad. And you don't want that, do you?' She shook her head, again. 'You know, it's the middle part that's the problem.' Hunched, standing quite still, Tabitha raised her eyes, and asked, 'The middle part?' 'Being alone. You can do this job. You can have a life where you need to be funny all the time, if you have people who love you, and you don't make them leave, by making fun of them.' She didn't shake her head, but she didn't nod, either. 'You have that, Tabby. A family. You don't have to end up like this.' He waved a hand over himself, and the red bean bag he lay on creaked. A silence followed. Professor Floghorn had a clock on the wall with Batman on it and it clicked, then clicked again. 'You still don't want it. You don't want to go to work yet. You don't want to support your family. You want to be a child, for awhile.' Tabitha nodded. Inside something said, I want my Mum to be alive. 'Okay.' Professor Floghorn rose from his bean bag in a sprightly, spring-like action. 'We have some more rooms to see. A tour to finish.' He paused, on the way to the office door. 'Maybe this is why you're the best person for this job. Maybe I'll have to offer it anyway, and see,' he said. 'And I haven't got long, before all the electricity's gone.' Tabby wasn't sure if he was saying it to her, as he was looking away. He nodded to himself, and pulled open the door and shouted, 'Next!' and Billy Hiccup walked in. Tabitha left, and sat on the bench with her father, who smiled, and cuddled her shoulders. They sat in silence. The professor opened the door on the other side of the bench. It did not creak but swung out smoothly, and beyond it was a darkened corridor and then, on the left, there was another door, on which was written, 'Quiet Please; Live Broadcast'. On their right, a further door had a sign that read, 'Don't Sniff; Big Fish'. The professor put a finger to his mouth, and crept forward, opening the door on the left of the corridor and what poured out was neither dark nor quiet, but their opposites. 'OWWWWWAHHHHH!' shouted a hundred young voices. The large room they entered had the sound of a rioting school. There was line after line of children sat, in an audience, to the two sides of them. On a plinth before the children was a clown who stood in a free standing bath and, behind the clown, was a wall, on which were printed the words, in the colours of a clown-suit, 'CLOWNing around'. 'I love Clowning Around,' said Tabitha in a burst of excited whispering. 'It's my favourite T.V. show!' 'Yes,' whispered the professor, in reply, 'we film it here, in the factory'' 'SNAKE POOOOOOOOO!' shouted the audience. 'Oh, dear,' said the professor. 'They've given him the snake poo.' An elf wearing a gas mask and carrying a plate of grey and brown gunk ran up to the clown, who still stood in the bath. The clown looked agitated and tried to get his large feet out of the bath's high, white sides, but kept slipping over. The tears on his face looked real and his make-up seemed to have run, as there were pasty, pinkish lines on his cheeks. His skin was peeking through, and it glistened. Tabitha had seen this forfeit before. 'The clown's got to wash the snake's doings off with the water from his squeezy flower, but it really stinks,' she said to her Dad. 'SNAKE POOOOOOOOO!' repeated the studio audience. One of the watching children fainted and was carried away by an elf. The clown was also swaying and gave a short, horrified squeeze of the squirting flower attached to the collar on his jacket, before vomiting all over his oversized shoes. This didn't help him stay on his feet, and he fell in the tub, and could be seen, on", "label": 1}
{"text": "all fours - still puking and trying to wash it, and the snake poo, down the plughole. The camera-elves (also wearing gasmasks) ran forward, to film it all. 'Later in the show'' said the professor, holding his nose, '' the audience have chosen the electric handshake, and shooting the clown out of the cannon at the studio wall.' The professor pointed at a wall on which there were several red stains. 'That's why we decided to call the show, 'clowning around', because we keep finding bits of the previous clowns, legs and what-nots, scattered around the studio.' Billy Hiccup was laughing, and snorted slightly as he did so. 'Isn't it a bit cruel?' asked Tabby's Dad. 'Clowns deserve it. Bloody pests, pretending to be funny, all these years! Want to stay for the cannon shooting?' asked the professor. 'Not really,' said Tabby's dad. 'POOOOOOOOOO!' shouted the audience. 'Next year we'll be doing this with ventriloquists. Bloody Dummies'' said the professor, '' is what we'll call the show.' Even Tabby didn't find it as funny - in real life - as on the television, and shook her head, as they left. The opposite door didn't take them to Big Fish, but to a small, plush room where a small, well dressed, moustachioed elf handed them a pair of monogrammed slippers (GF) and a burgundy, deep-pile dressing gown with the same Capital Letters on it (GF). This room had a further, thick, metal door. 'Put the dressing gowns on over your clothes,' said the professor. 'It's cold in the freezer.' Through that thick, metal door, was a large freezer in which fish were kept, on leather chairs, and in smoking jackets. There were about fifteen of the fish which, the professor had explained, were 'large, north-sea cod'. The freezer had the look of a frozen gentleman's club. On Chesterfield sofas and luxurious leather chairs, the cods lounged and smoked and drank whiskey and brandy, and talked politics and philosophical debate. The large cods smoked from pipes like those in Arabian Nights, and, as they spoke, bubbles of water rose from their mouths, darkening the freezer's atmosphere, and giving it the look of the deep sea. The bubbles popped on the ceiling like water balloons, releasing the sound of them speaking. 'Here, here,' one fish said, his speech-bubble popping on a settee, wetting a tasselled cushion. 'These are the cod philosophers,' Professor Floghorn had said, still in his whisper. 'They sit around here and talk cod philosophy. For some people, mainly old people, the things they say are very funny.' The cod philosophers tried to ignore the group of two children and two adults as much as possible. Their black, deep eyes turned away from them in distaste, and they could be heard huffing disgruntled sounds about 'the wrong sort'. After some throat clearing and 'things just aren't the way the used to be's and 'youth today's, one of the cod philosophers held up a fin, and cleared its throat. The freezer quietened. The eyes of the other cod narrowed. The cod philosopher said, 'There isn't a point to life.' 'Mmmm?' said the other cod, disbelievingly, Tabitha thought. 'There is a blunt to life.' The freezer was quiet, and cold. 'There are so many points to life,' continued the cod philosopher, 'that ' when they are put together - they form a blunt, flat surface.' The silence and the cold continued. Tabitha looked at her father, who shrugged. 'Oh, very good,' said another cod. 'The blunt of life!' said a further. 'Well, that has a ring to it.' 'Oh yes, yes, hurumph,' said several. 'Yes, yes, indeed.' 'And that's how it works, in here,' said Professor Floghorn. 'Leaves me a bit cold, this room,' said Floghorn, and raised his palm to his lips and laughed prettily into it. 'Ah, ah, ah, ah.' 'Next, we'll go up to the viewing balcony,' said the professor. They replaced the burgundy dressing robes on the hooks outside the freezer and followed Professor Floghorn to a curve of spiralling metal steps. Circling, they went up, Tabby feeling more at ease when she was facing the factory wall than when she looked out over the factory floor. She felt dizzy seeing all the elves and factory lines and the growing pile of mass-produced slap-sticks. (The hands at the ends of these had also been whittled by elves). Halfway up the stairs there was a balcony, above which the steps continued and disappeared through a hole in the ceiling. It wasn't the only hole above them. 'These,' said Professor Floghorn, who pointed upward and slightly to the side, 'are the vents leading to the Ground Floor.' 'I thought this was the Ground Floor,' said Billy. 'Oh, no, this is the Whole Floor. Everything in it is whole, and in one piece, but if you look out over the air you can see the giggles rising, and when they get to the vents, they are separated. They are separated because above us, on the Ground Floor, they will be ground into their smallest parts. Here, put these on.' The professor offered a pair of sunglasses to each of the two remaining interviewees, and to Tabby's Dad. 'These eye-pieces,' he said, ' allow you to see all the colours of the light-spectrum, including those you normally can't see, such as: ultra-violet, infra-red, and tickled-pink. Laughter, as you will be able to see, is only visible in the latter.' Indeed, Tabitha watched as, below in the Poo Train department, a laugh could be heard, and its progress seen, glittering like a sneeze from the nose-end of a golden ingot, as it rose through the air, and as, turning red, it disappeared through the metal vents above them. 'It's the energy field ' the funny field, as I call it. That's why the giggles glow, before they go.' 'What makes the funny field? Bet it's powerful'' said Billy Hiccup, his thumbs in his pockets. He was thumbing something and that movement caused the thing", "label": 1}
{"text": "to raise a curve of its circular head. Tabby could see the side of a golden coin, exactly like the one Mr Forturoy-Jones had given her. So, that's why his fingers are always in his pockets, she thought. 'Oh. It is,' said the professor, with a strange look. 'One of the most powerful, funniest things in the whole universe.' His look was strange because it was directed at Tabby's father; not at Billy. 'Sir, I don't believe I know your name. Do you have one?' Tabitha's father blinked. 'It's Blatt. Charlie Blatt.' He extended his hand for the professor to shake. Floghorn, instead, took it, and peered at the fingertips, and underneath the fingernails. 'So it is,' he said, 'but you didn't need to prove it. I would have believed you.' Tabby's Dad withdrew his hand and stared at his nails, with an odd expression of his own. 'I have a question for you,' said the professor. A pause. 'Yes?' asked Mr Blatt. 'No, not that question. Good guess, though. It is; what are you doing here?' 'I'm with Tabby.' He hugged Tabby's shoulders. 'Yes, I can see that. But what are you doing here?' Tabby's father sighed. 'Look sir' professor' I'm sorry, but I'm not here for anything, except her. You see, I've dragged Tabitha round the country after me and my wife, from city to city, school to school, friends to friends, and she's never said anything about it. I'm more than happy, just this once, to be here for her, and to stay quiet.' Billy Hiccup wasn't listening, but continued to itch at his golden coin as Professor Floghorn stared at Tabby's dad. The professor turned, eventually, to Tabitha and said, 'I'm not laughing, but that's the happiest I've felt for quite some time.' He turned once more to Mr Blatt and then his daughter, and eventually said, 'Well, I've enjoyed the view for long enough. Let's go up.' And they did. 'So, the giggle-whats power the giggle-wumps, and the additional giggle-whats created in the giggle-wumps go down the giggle-wires,' said the professor, for the umpteenth time. Several more of his hairs were hanging by their tips from his scalp. Billy Hiccup asked, 'So where does the power come from?' as he had on several occasions. 'The giggle-whats'' 'Giggle watts?' said Billy. 'No, whats.' 'That's what I said ' watt.' 'No, with an 'h',' said Professor Floghorn. 'As in a unit of electricity.' 'WHAT!' Billy Hiccup took a deep breath. 'As in a unit of electricity,' he repeated. The Professor cheeks were going red in lines, like his hair. 'NOT WHAT WITH A QUESTION MARK! WHAT WITH AN EXCLAMATION MARK!' Billy Hiccup considered this. He rubbed his eyes, 'What I need to know is where'' he began. 'Let me explain,' said Professor Floghorn, talking over him and breathing over his own words. 'The electricity comes from people who giggle. The best giggles for making electricity are the giggles you make when you're surprised ' shocked, even. You know, the kind of laughter at things that are funny that you don't see coming. So, it is called a giggle-what! As in, gee, eye, gee, gee, el, ee' double u, aych, ay, tea, exclamation mark.' He shook, both his lips and his fingers, and had to lean against the wall to calm the latter. 'I understand,' said Tabby's father, nodding slowly. Billy shrugged. 'All I want to know is what'' 'Look,' managed the professor, digging with his fingers into the sharp line of his breast pocket, and pulling out a small item. 'Human beings, when you boil them down, are basically this.' He held the object up, between thumb and forefinger, which still shook a little. 'A half-eaten Twix?' asked Tabby. 'Oh, wrong thing.' He dug in his pocket again, and retrieved another item. 'A battery?' asked Billy. 'Yes, we have this chemical energy flowing around all the cells in our body. Electrical energy. Particularly around our brain, which, really, is a very complicated electric circuit. Giggles, particularly shocked giggles, release this down our throats, and this factory captures the released energy, as it rises through the vents, from the Whole Level below.' 'Oh 'kay,' said Billy slowly, staring at Professor Floghorn's pocket as he put the battery back into it. 'This energy, which we call giggle-whats! drives these pumps'' he pointed at a line of bellows that looked like the guts of massive accordions, and were half-hid by belches of steam and flatulences of smoke, ''which we call giggle-wumps, and, from these, the electricity passes along the giggle-wires, and out into your homes, and your toasters, and your televisions, and your toothbrushes.' Tabitha frowned. She had never heard of an electric toothbrush. It sounded, frankly, unbelievable. At this point, the professor leaned in, his hair leaning further. 'But the most important part of the factory is the funny field that traps the giggle-whats! as they leave the people below. The funny field pulls the laughter through the vents. That's what we saw on the viewing gallery- when you wore the sunglasses- the colours, they were made by the interaction between happiness and the funny field.' 'And what powers the funny field?' said Billy, through gritted teeth, as though the gum stuck there had finally hardened. 'Um,' said Tabitha raising a hand. 'Professor... can I have word?' She tried not to look at Billy's pocket, though she knew what was in it, and what it meant. Professor Floghorn looked at her and smiled. 'I think I know what you want to say, Miss Blatt, but you may, yes.' 'Somewhere...?' she was going to add, 'private?' but the professor stopped her. 'Oh, I thought it was going to be another word, to be honest. I thought it was going to be 'betrayal'. No, no time for a second word, I'm afraid, let's proceed; I have to show you the very secret centre of the Giggle Factory. I have to show you what, as Master Hiccup put it, powers the funny", "label": 1}
{"text": "staffroom and picked up the blue costume. Its material had the words CANCER FOUNDATION written across the blue skin of its right arm. Tabitha guessed this wasn't the kind of foundation her step-mother put on her skin, before she went to work. An older teacher with a face white as bathroom soap (and hair greasy as the curls you sometimes find on it) looked up from the photocopier. 'Mrs Wilbur asked me to get this,' Tabitha said, holding the costume. 'She needs to change soon.' The teacher nodded and turned back to the photocopier which was beeping at her and would not, by the look of the woman hitting its buttons, stop. Tabitha left the staff room and entered the disabled toilet outside it. She put on the light, before closing the door. Tabby liked this toilet - there was no way for any teachers to see in. She came here, sometimes, during lunchtime. Because the costume had its own, built-on, clownish feet, she took off her shoes and hid them in the bin, under discarded paper towels. Then, grinning, she put on the costume. Despite Tabitha's height, the legs were baggy and, when she practised walking around the toilet, she developed a low, rolling gait. She thought this was the way a troll would walk. She smiled, again, and the smile was repeated by the big blue-and-white head of the costume. It had large eyes made of stringy, black gauze, through which Tabitha tried to see ' which was difficult. Tabitha felt like a fly with spider web laid across its eyes. It was hard to move her arms. She edged out of the toilet and walked - hips rolling above the stout, short legs - back to her classroom. Tabitha had once watched a war film and, when grenades or bombs went off on the television, the sound became dulled, with a slight whine. Her hearing was much like this, from within the felt head. She opened the door to her classroom and the door may well have creaked, as it always did, but Tabitha didn't hear it. Mrs Wilbur hated to be interrupted during her lessons, and she sighed so that even Tabby noticed, before saying, 'Okay, children, say hello to'' Mrs Wilbur paused, eyes widening as if hoping Tabitha would fill the silence. She did not. Instead, Tabby waved her hands at the class, and especially at Susan Wilkins, and capered across the back of the classroom. She danced as she thought a jester would dance. And bowed, and waved, and made farting noises. Susan, who had been crying, managed a smile, as the other children took the opportunity to laugh. 'Thank-you, Mr'' said Mrs Wilbur, glaring at Tabby. Tabitha realised she thought she was a male teacher. Frank, who sat at the front of the class, was clutching his belly, and going red from laughter. Mrs Wilbur had light-pink skin which, when she became angry, went a see-through shade of white. When she shouted, her nostrils would widen and flap, as though about to take flight. Given the noise that erupted from below them, Tabitha wouldn't have blamed them. Now, the nostrils were beginning to widen, so Tabitha bowed as low as her wrinkled, blue knees would allow, and opened the door, and left again. Behind her, she could hear the year six class laughing, and Mrs Wilbur shouting. Tabby's hips and shoulders rolled on, as she walked through all of the years down to Nursery. She opened each door and interrupted every lesson and waved at the children and blew raspberries and pretend-farts at the teachers. Some of the adults smiled, but many of them did not. All the children laughed until the empty school corridors were crowded with giggles. Tabby hadn't been at this school for long but felt, as she often did, that laughs were her friends. She didn't yet have real ones. Tabby was funny and could count on getting laughs. From time to time, the corridor-lights dimmed and fizzled and crackled. It sounded as though, Tabitha thought, they were sniggering. When Tabitha entered the last classroom ' the Nursery - the little children were playing, as she knew they would be. An adult waved at Tabby and then ignored her, perhaps thinking, as the other teachers had, that she was one of them. So Tabitha danced with a little girl, whose face lit up like a birthday cake. Tabby then played lego with the boys. The costume's hands were large and flappy and awkward, and she kept missing one lego-brick, with the other. Most of the boys pointed and chortled, but one kicked her in the leg when their teacher was in the water area, trying not to slip over. 'Ouch,' said Tabitha. (From inside the costume, it sounded like, 'Omff'.) While his teacher was occupied with a mop, Tabitha grabbed the boy's shoulders and pushed him onto the wooden balcony outside the Nursery. Then, she locked the door and encouraged a group of six children to dance the conga and sing, so that no-one would hear him crying and banging on the glass. Tabitha led the line of dancing children around the classroom, through a corner that had been made into a fake factory, and to the Numeracy area beside the door. It was then that the teacher noticed the little boy Tabitha had locked on the balcony. The teacher rushed over, and let the boy in, ducking to kneel beside him. The costume pressed in around Tabby's skin, as though she was buried in it. She couldn't breathe. He's going to grass on me, she thought. The little boy had shaved, grey hair and red eyes and a finger that rose to point at Tabitha, before, suddenly there was a Click and a Hiss, and his eyes weren't red, and his hair wasn't grey, and all Tabby could see of him was a shadow. The lights had gone out. 'Power-cut,' shouted one adult. 'Get the candles out,' shouted", "label": 1}
{"text": "field.' 'Please,' said Tabitha, her eyes glinting quickly between the comedian and the professor. Her father put a hand on her shoulder. 'The professor knows what he's doing,' he said, before he added, 'We'd better catch up.' For the professor was several strides ahead and heading toward a further set of steps, visible only now they followed, and passed through the steam, and the smoke. 'Quick, quick, this is the exciting bit!' said the professor, hurrying. Billy Hiccup seemed to agree, because, despite his newfound heft, he kept up with Professor Floghorn. Tabitha struggled to do the same. 'Dad' dad,' she said. 'He's got one of the coins, he's going to steal the secret of the factory. He's going to give it Forturoy-Jones.' 'What? Who?' said her Dad, above bursts of steam. 'Come on! Quick, darling, we're falling behind. We don't want to get lost in this place.' Then, like the smoke and the steam; they were rising up the steps. Soon, it became clear that they had entered the tower at the crest of the Factory's ceiling. The smoke and steam didn't disappear but blended into the ill-lit shadowy climb of the stairs, which shadowed further until Tabitha couldn't see the nose in front of her face, and would have had an even harder time seeing her nostrils. They rose, and climbed, and ascended. Gradually from above, there glittered a beautiful golden light. If gold could cry tears, and those tears could be held in the air, fine as mist, the light would have looked like this. As Tabitha rose, she realised that the light was coming from innumerable suspended objects, hanging in the space at the top of the tower. Tabitha and her father came to the end of the steps, and to a balcony, which the professor was hanging off, pointing at something. Billy was doing the same. 'And' this' is ' it,' breathed the professor. 'The centre of the factory. Where the funny field comes from. Its secret!' 'Brussels sprouts,' said Billy, as though he could believe his eyes, but not what was in front of them. 'Oh, yes. The funny field is powered by Brussels sprouts. Brussels sprouts are the third funniest thing in all of the known universe.' Mr Blatt laughed at them, hanging in the air, glowing, like Brussels sprouts that had gone to heaven and grown angel wings. 'Oh, yes. Ah.' The professor hid his wide lips with a manicured hand. 'Ah, ah. We used to have the second funniest thing hanging up here, but it was impractical.' 'What was that?' said Billy. 'Mother-in-laws. Very funny mother in-laws are; millions of jokes about them, in every galaxy and every solar system, and very cheap to buy. You wouldn't believe how many people were willing to give their mother-in-laws away for nearly nothing, just so they would hang here, in mid-air, and give off their funny field. Very generous, people can be, ah, ah, ah.' The presence of the sprouts seemed to be setting off the professor's laughter and he drew out a handkerchief, so that he could continue politely. 'Ah, ah, ah.' Tabitha found she was smiling. The Brussels sprouts twinkled, not like they were stars, but like they were winking at her. 'Problem was the nagging, oh the nagging,' said the professor. 'You could hear those mother-in-laws carping and gossiping and nagging all the way down to the factory floor. That's what happened to the monkeys in the Plath room and the Hemmingway room. They just couldn't live with the nagging. Ended up blowing themselves up, or shooting themselves in the head. Poor, bleeding monkeys.' Tabitha blinked at this. Strangely, with the sprouts nearby, she couldn't stop smiling. It was leaving her feeling dizzy, as if she had banged her head and her expression had stuck. 'What's the funniest thing in the universe, then, professor?' she asked. 'The funniest. Ah,' chortled Floghorn, 'why that's God of course. Bloody hilarious He is.' Tabitha watched as Billy Hiccup reached out and plucked a Brussels sprout. 'So this is the secret of the Giggle Factory,' he whispered. 'Professor!' she said, but, though her head was full of alarm and threat, she couldn't force any of it through her lips, which were still grinning. 'I'm going to be great,' Billy Hiccup cackled. Tabitha thought of witches. 'I don't need your crummy job, Flogface,' he shouted. The tower echoed, 'I'm gonna be great.' And, with a skip and a dance-step, he descended the stairs two at a time. 'Professor!' said Tabby. Tabitha ran after Billy. Behind her she heard silence, and then the paniced sound of sudden chasing. Going down, Billy was even faster than he had been going up. Quickly, they were back on the Ground Floor, and from there, she was chasing Billy through giggle-wires and past giggle-wumps, and to the next set of stairs. She knew where he was going. She remembered her step-mother, in the caf', saying there was a rubbish chute in the basement, and to put the secret of the Giggle Factory in it, and flush the rubbish away. He was going to go down, and he did, clattering on the stairs, banging across the balcony, bursting through a work party of elves. 'Sorry, sorry'' said Tabitha as she stepped on one of the elves' head, as it sat up, growling. Its growling became something of a squelching, but she had no time to look, and kept going. Billy Hiccup had reached the Whole Floor. A moment later, so did Tabby. CLICK. Darkness. The CLICKing sound of the lights going out was, to Tabitha, like that of stepping on a twig in the middle of a dark forest. Shards of fear flew through her veins and arteries as the light-bulbs stopped. Momentarily, the red, eye-ish light alone shone through the factory floor and it cast a Hellish scene, of elves at their benches, and Billy Hiccup descending the stairs in the floor's centre, and the silhouetted, twisted arms of looming", "label": 1}
{"text": "machines. And, then, even the red eye of light winked, fluttered, and went black. The dark was solid; so much so Tabby's mouth thought it couldn't draw in air. Tabitha could feel her lungs panicing, and they weren't alone in her body, as all of her organs joined in. The darkness spread out and out about her, and she knew, in the way adult's seemed to know things (without the slightest doubt) that the blackness went beyond the factory walls, into the night, and across the land. The electricity had run out. The Dark Ages are back, she thought, and was unsure why. She found history boring, and hadn't thought she had been listening. There was screaming somewhere nearby, and she realised it was in the hospital wing at the end of the Poo train, and remembered that there had been the beeping of heart monitors, there; before. These had now stopped. She wondered if the screaming was Sir Peasbody, and started to sweat. Tabby put one foot in front of the other, but only by a millimetre. She couldn't go as far as inching, forward - she had heard the Jenga-scatter of wood ahead, and knew that Billy had knocked off a stack of elf-whittled witticisms. She didn't want to step on one, and cut her feet, and bleed blood she couldn't see on an invisible floor. Her lungs felt big in her chest, and her heart bigger. In the dark, the factory felt like it made shivers, not giggles. Giggles, she thought. I need giggles. Tabby gulped. She had always found it hard to talk in the pitch black, just in case something answered her back. She swallowed, and whispered, 'Why are pirates called pirates?' No one asked why, in return. 'Because they 'Arrrrr',' she answered. It didn't make her laugh. She felt cold, deep inside, as she did when the voice that sounded like her Dad reminded her that, Your Mum died. Pinching her palms until tears made her eyes runny, she said louder, 'Why are pirates called pirates?' She breathed to steady her voice. 'Because they 'Arrrrr'.' Still, she didn't feel the giggles inside her, let alone coming up and out of her throat. Louder, she thought. Her skin crawled, as though something was about to touch her, in the shadows. Her throat itched. She put her finger-nails deeper into her hands. 'WHY ARE PIRATES CALLED PIRATES?' she shouted. The factory echoed. Silence, then, far away, she heard, 'why?' 'BECAUSE THEY 'ARRRR'!' she shouted. From behind and above her (maybe from the stairs) there was a reply. She knew it as deeply as she knew the voice that spoke in her mind. It was her father; laughing. In between the chortles, she heard him saying, 'That's a new one' I've not heard that one'', and then more laughter. In the ceiling, there was the butterfly-fluttering sound of vents eating giggles, and beyond, and higher, that of giggle-wumps pumping, and giggle-wires fizzing. The lights hissed back on. Tabby, again, ran, taking the stairs not two but three at a time. The Mirrors of Changing, she thought, between one footstep and the next. There wasn't, though, any time for foreboding, as she went down the final flight of stairs, and toward the Cellar of Irony. Ahead, mirrors glinted and winked and, curvy-edged, seemed to smile. The mirrors of changing always change you, she remembered the professor saying, as she passed them. Tabitha put her hand in her pocket and held onto the photograph of her mother and thought, Anything, but please don't take her memory away. Ever since her Mum had died, Tabby hadn't liked change. Ahead, Billy was slowing, and she was catching up. Soon, she saw why. He had grown again. With a squelch and a screech, he popped through between the last of the mirrors, and into the basement. He was, now, immense. 'Stop' don't'' said Tabby. Tabitha emerged into the Cellar of Irony and, following her own advice, stopped. The basement was utterly empty, apart from her and a massive, lumbering Billy, who could be seen, clutching a Brussels sprout as though it were the secret of the universe. He had spotted the round entrance to the garbage chute, and the large, red button beside it, which was labelled 'rubbish' in tall, black lettering. 'No,' she said, but she couldn't help tearing her gaze from Billy, and staring at her own body. It was unchanged by the Mirrors of Changing. She took her hand from her pocket, so that she could run it across her head, and see if she now had three eyes, or purple hair, or antennae, and the photograph of her mother came out with the hand, stuck on by sweat. On the photograph, she could see her mother's face. The picture had changed. Her mum was facing upward, toward where the camera had been. She was beautiful. As Tabby watched, the photo was still changing' developing, even' her mother's lips still moving. They were, quite clearly, mouthing the words, 'I love you.' Professor Floghorn and her father entered the basement with a clatter of footsteps. The professor had brunette hair and her father was wearing a swim suit, swimming goggles, and a deep, brown tan. He looked like he had been working out. Grasping at and glancing at his hair, the professor said, 'Brilliant, leather jackets again!' and then, 'Stop right there, young man.' Billy Hiccup, who had not been lumbering very quickly, hardly had to slow to stop, which he did. It took considerably more time for him to turn around. 'What, old man?' he asked. 'What are you doing? How could you betray the Giggle Factory like this?' Billy Hiccup smiled a small, mean smile. In his rounder face, it was nearly invisible. 'I've been made a better job offer.' Tabitha stepped forward. Exhaustion left no room inside her for fear. Either that, or she could still hear her mother's words. 'You've been bribed,' she said. 'Forturoy-Jones paid", "label": 1}
{"text": "you a thousand pounds.' 'A thousand pounds!' Billy Hiccup chortled and then laughed. It was an evil sound, like that a crow would make after murdering a dove. There was then a subtle change in the basement's atmosphere, as though the laughs were being gathered and manhandled and moulded. 'A thousand pounds! You saw this?' he ripped his jean's pocket, pulling out the golden coin. 'Didn't you, little detective girly? A thousand pounds is nothing to me! This is just the seal of our bargain. Mr Forturoy-Jones has the power to make me the biggest comedian in the world. The biggest gigs. The biggest stage for my talent.' 'Don't'' said Tabby's Dad. '' it's not worth the money.' 'Money! Hah! Keep this.' He threw the coin at Tabby, who caught it. 'This is nothing. Money is nothing. I live for the comedy. It is my calling, and I'm going to be the biggest comic this world has ever seen, or ever will see.' He turned back to the chute, stepped forward, and opened its cover. Tabitha was too far away to stop him, though she ran at him, but she was near enough to hear the flump of the Brussels sprout being thrown in, and landing on something soft, and to hear the hiss of Billy's breath. 'I don't believe it,' Billy Hiccup said. She was close enough, now, to see what he couldn't believe. The rubbish chute was full of Brussels sprouts; piles and mounds and stacks of green vegetables, gently rotting and making the smell of a Christmas afternoon. 'All the sprouts go in there for the tip, when they go off. Always have,' said the professor, in the background. Fast as one of her pranks, Tabitha threw the golden coin on top of the piled sprouts, reached out, and pressed the large, red button that said 'Rubbish'. The chute door closed and there was a swallowing sound, as the refuse was sucked away and to the distant garbage tip. Momentarily, there was silence, before Billy Hiccup began to laugh. His knees, perhaps because he was laughing so hard, gave way, and he crashed to the floor. 'Hah! Hah! Hah!' he said, to the floor, and, between the laughter, he gasped, 'Mr Forturoy-Jones is going to think I put that in there. He's going to think the coin is a magical one. The secret of the factory. Even though he gave it to me. Hah! Hah Hah!' He couldn't stop laughing, and dribbled onto the concrete below his cheek. Soon, the rest of the party had to join in, and especially Professor Floghorn, who - with his big, trumpeting lips - was laughing harder than all the rest and not 'ah-ah-ah'ing at all. The lights in the Cellar of Irony were brighter than they had been before, as, high above them, giggle-wumps could be heard fluttering, and giggle-wires fizzing. On the Whole Floor, the upside down, gigantic traffic lights were lit all the way up to green. At its bench, one of the elves stopped whittling, and smiled a small, content smile, before the others growled at him, and he went back to work. Electricity ran down the wires that led out of the Giggle Factory, like lightning down pipes; powering computers and light-bulbs and toothbrushes. In homes across the country, old ladies knitted faster, because they could see the ends of their needles. In hospitals, heart monitors kept beeping. In Tabby's school, the lights never went out again. Tabitha and her swim-suited father and Professor Floghorn sat where the elves had been, at one of the miniature wooden benches, their knees pushed up to their chests. As it was after three, the elves had rung off duty and could be heard, upstairs, drinking and partying. Apparently, there was a pool, which Tabitha had been unable to see, due to the smoke and the steam. 'They like the company hot tub,' Professor Floghorn had explained. Joan had been let in, by the professor, and sat beside her husband. She could not stop looking around the factory, as if she thought it would make more sense the second time she saw it. (She kept, for instance, staring at her husband's tanned, muscular, waxed chest.) The factory was still, apart from the elves, all there. Billy wasn't. He was, now, due to his girth, unable to leave the basement. The professor had promised that the elves would care for him and feed him, though most of the food in the factory was left-over Brussels sprouts. 'Well,' said the professor. 'I would like to thank you for attending the interview for Head Laugher. But I regret to say that the position has been filled already.' 'What?' said Joan. 'Who by? Tabitha's the only one left, and she's the funniest person I've ever known.' 'She may well be, Mrs Blatt, but you've never known me.' 'You're going to stay on?' asked Tabitha. The professor smiled. 'Yes, my dear. You made me laugh again, really laugh for the first time in years. And thinking about that golden coin, I don't think I'll ever stop, or not for long. I don't need a full-time Head Laugher, anymore; not for a long time.' 'Well, then, what was the point in all this?' Joan spread her arms around, but couldn't look at the 'this' she was waving at. 'Darling, don't worry'' said her husband. 'Ahem, sorry to interrupt,' said the professor. 'But I have a new position I wish to fill. It seems I need a caretaker, to protect my factory's secrets. The successful applicant for the caretaker post need not be funny, but they need to be loyal and honest, and ' most of all - they need to care.' Professor Floghorn looked directly at Tabitha's Dad. 'Do you have a job, Mr Blatt?' Mr Blatt's lower lip dropped down and, out of the large, toothy hole that it made, came a 'no!'. 'Will you accept a position here? You will be well remunerated, of", "label": 1}
{"text": "course.' A 'yes' followed the 'no' and Tabby's step-mother hugged her husband, and kissed his brown forehead. 'Of course, I will retire one day, many years from now. So, maybe, in the meantime, you, Tabitha Blatt, could stay in school, and finish your studies and, maybe, but only if I can't think of ways to be funny, I could invite you back on weekends, from time to time. Do you think you could come here, then, and help me?' Tabitha nodded. 'I don't think my socks would fall off, if I did,' she said. The adults turned to stare at her. 'It means;' she explained, 'I wouldn't be surprised if I came back' And, if you do run out of hilarious things to do, you could ask Billy. He may be greedy, but he is funny, and he'd help you, if he had nothing better to do.' 'I'm not alone, anymore, am I?' asked Professor Floghorn, after a pause. 'No,' answered Tabby. Then, the Blatt family rose from the benches, and Professor Floghorn shook each by the hand, and didn't inspect their fingernails. As the professor and Joan shook, she pressed the golden coin that Forturoy-Jones had given to Tabby into his palm. 'Keep this,' Joan said, to the professor, 'to remind you of laughing. I don't want it, anymore.' In some direction a mile from the Giggle Factory, Mr Forturoy-Jones clambered across a mountain of green rubbish. His feet squelching, he had to press his hand to his mouth, to stop the vomit coming out. The fingers, which he had previously been using to balance with, wiped long tendrils of half-rotted sprout across his lean jaw-line, until he had the look of a large alligator which had been let loose in a sewer. Eventually, and coated completely in green, he found what he was looked for, amid the pile of stinking refuse. 'Ah 'hah!' he said, in his accent, and the thing glinted in the last sunlight of the day. 'I have found what I was looking for!' 'Sir' sir?' 'Bag this and take it to the lab,' said Mr Forturoy-Jones. 'Clean it, and study it,' he gingerly passed the golden coin to one of his many assistants. He had wanted to be the one to find it, and he had, and the finding filled him with, if not joy, then what he would call the feeling of winning. It felt right, as well - that it was a coin. Mr Forturoy-Jones was a big believer in the power of money. 'This,' he added. 'will make our company great. That is not any old gold coin, Mr'' he snapped his fingers; he had forgotten the underling's name. It didn't matter. Soon he would be so powerful, he wouldn't have to remember anybody's names, and everybody would know his. '' Mr Thingy, no ordinary gold coin worth a paltry thousand pounds. Oh, no, that coin came straight from the centre of the Giggle Factory. It is the secret to all of the power in the world, so treat it like you would treat your own, personal god.' Like you will come to treat me, he added, inside his brain. 'Now,' he said, 'I need to wash this dirty, disgusting, stinking rubbish off.' Covered in, and smelling of, Brussels sprouts, Mr Forturoy-Jones could not help but giggle as he made his way back to his limousine, and, soon, he was giggling so much, tears ran down his cheeks. 4", "label": 1}
{"text": "another. 'AWWWWAHWWAH,' screamed the Nursery children, not entirely fearfully. 'Stop shouting!' shouted an adult. Before the teacher could catch her, Tabitha opened the door and led the conga line of children out of it. 'Keep hold of me,' she said, in the dark, and they did, a tiny pair of hands on her wide hips, and behind that child, another grasped her tiny hips, like this; [picture of a conga line of children, led by Tabby] Together, they conga'd down the corridor to the hall, and, from there, to the dining room, at which point, there was a further Click, and another Hiss, and the lights came back on. Tabby turned her head to make sure the children were all still there. Behind her, the first child, a girl with hair the colour of a melted Twix, still held onto her blue hips. Behind the girl, two boys and three girls ended the conga-line. Tabitha restarted the dance and the conga-line, which still looked a lot like this, [repeated picture of the conga-line] continued on its way. A male teacher, bearded and lean, stopped to join in, and stayed with them, making dance moves like Egyptian hieroglyphics, until they reached the reception. Then, with a salute and a 'have-fun-kids', he entered the staffroom. Saluting back and giggling (with all of the Nursery children joining in), Tabby led the way past the Headmistress' office, and out of the school's wide front door. Inside the heavy costume, Tabby began to sweat. She thought this was because she was excited. She had left the school during school-time, before (normally, when she was sent home), but never with several small children in tow. She felt like a teacher. Thinking of the male teacher, Tabitha now walked like an Egyptian, making her wide hands and head and feet as pointy as possible, which was like trying to sharpen cushions, and led the small children through the tall school gates, and along the street which ran beside the school fence. From there, she turned right, and, together, they conga'd up the road, to the corner shop. Its door pinged as Tabitha entered. And then over and over again, as the children followed. 'Hello,' said a balding man from behind the counter. He was tall and bearded and laughed like a rich giant at the sight of Tabby leading in the children. Tabby had said 'hello' to him before. All the children from the school bought their football cards and sweeties here. Now, muffled by the costume, she said, 'Hel-lumpf.' Giggling, the little children careened around the shop, picking up magazines, staring at packets of sweets, and trying to see through the foil-tops of football-card packs. One of them, a short, round boy with a body like a can of coke, jumped up and down, trying to reach a yellow water-gun that had been hung from the ceiling. The shop keeper walked around the counter. Squinting at Tabitha as though trying to guess her height, he said, 'All coming out of the school's pocket'Miss' I mean; Sir' I hope, and not from your money?' Tabitha nodded, as far as she could, and made a thumbs-up sign without having a thumb to use; using, instead, a fat, felt finger. 'Salaries don't go as far as they used to, eh, not since the bad times,' he said, taking the plastic gun and sweets and Spiderman magazines to the counter and ringing in the prices. The water-pistol came up as '10.00. 'Thank goodness the Giggle Factory stopped it getting even worse, eh?' Tabitha nodded her head, but must have looked as though she was shaking it, afterwards, as she desperately searched for the children. They had disappeared behind columns of beans and stacks of bread. At least she knew they hadn't left the shop. There hadn't been a ping! 'Have you heard, that will be twenty-one pounds, forty-seven pence, the Giggle Factory are hiring a new Head-Laugher? You should try out for it. Looks like you know how to make children laugh.' There was a ping! and Tabitha stared at the shop keeper in shock. Oh, God, she thought. One of the kids has escaped! The shopkeeper must have thought she was listening to him. He continued, saying, 'Yeah, old Professor Floghorn is resigning. Can you imagine..?' at least he continued until the Headmistress interrupted him, with a shout, 'Here you are!' Tabitha kept staring at the counter. 'Karen, why did you bring the children out of school? How could you? The Nursery teachers are beside themselves! I'm sorry, but this is the last time I invite the Cancer Foundation to my sch'' There was another ping! Behind Tabby, the Headmistress said, 'Karen?' And Karen said, 'Who's wearing my suit? I said only I could wear it! What happens if it got ripped?' Tabitha felt hands tugging insistently at the edges of her wide, blue-and-white head. It was the same feeling as being shaken awake. The head popped off. 'Tabitha Blatt!' said the Headmistress. 'You are coming with me!' The Headmistress gripped Tabby by the arm and led her out onto the pavement. A moment later she returned for the Nursery children, most of whom were giggling until, at least, they saw the Headmistress' face. Unseen by Karen, the Headmistress, or Tabitha, the shopkeeper was still laughing long after they had gone, until not only his cheeks but his teeth ached. Unable to stop, he had to lock the shop, and go and sit in the dark storeroom at the back, until school-letting-out time.eadHead The Bad Times Dad wouldn't let Tabby sit in the front seat. She had looked at her father's face and known he wouldn't want to hear her latest joke (why are pirates called pirates?.. Because they 'Arrrrr'). So, instead, she stared through the car's back window, and into the big, grey, elephant-skin sky. She tried to ignore the sound of their car. Ever since the oil had run out, cars had run on electricity, and whined", "label": 1}
{"text": "like five year olds being fed vegetables. She was so busy thinking, she didn't see the newspaper sign outside the corner shop, with its caged Capital Letters ('PROF RESIGNS AS HEAD LAUGHER') or that of the jobs paper, beside it ('1,500 JOBS THIS WEEK ' GIGGLE FACTORY HIRING!!!'). Instead, she did what she did when she couldn't talk to her father, when he would barely look at her, when his eyes were taut as the skin on the African Drums at school, when she couldn't make him laugh ' she thought of her Mum. As she remembered the colour of her mother' hair (like the lacework on the top of a gateaux; dark chocolate but shimmering under the light) she would grip the back of her left hand with the fingers of her right. Tabby would squeeze her own hand and, as she remembered the way her Mum would do the same, she would smile. But then she would be unable to remember what her mother's smile looked like, or her nose, or her eyes, and Tabby would try to think about something else. But trying never worked. It had been a bad time and her Mum had died' There had been shouting in the street, on the drive, by the car. Later, Dad had said the men were trying to take the car-battery, though why Mum went out to argue about something as small as a battery, Tabby didn't know. There were three in the T.V. zapper, and she would have given her Mum them all, and not watched her favourite show (CLOWNing Around), if only she'd asked. Instead Mum had asked the robbers to stop. Dad had said they didn't mean to kill her. He had said something else, after that, but then Tabitha had crumpled, as Tabby would crumple a piece of paper, and her hearing had caved in, and her sight became wrinkled and dark. Dad had had to tell her several times, over the years. It wasn't as though her brain couldn't remember, but like it was trying to forget. Your Mum died. 'Get your stuff,' said her Dad. 'We're here.' He had parked on the kerb. Tabby leant forward and levered up the front seat. She got out on the other side from her Dad. Being tall, Tabitha was able to peek over the car's roof at her father, to see if he would look at her. He wouldn't. The roof was leopard-spotted with rust. Before, they had a silver car with a button that made the lights flash; a button that beeped, and locked all the doors. Now, Dad had to go around the car, pulling at the door handles. He did this in silence and the doors creaked. They used to have a drive and a nice house, but had moved three times in the last two years, and now Tabby slept on the sofa, in the lounge. Needs must, her step-mother said. We need to stop moving, Dad had said once, looking at Tabitha. You need to get a job, then, her step-mother had replied. They had moved, soon after, to a smaller house. They both said, 'it's cheaper to heat'. Her Dad had smiled and added, 'we'll be able to eat more'. 'Maybe', her step-mother had said. They didn't. Walking to the front door, Tabitha thought - people live in smaller and smaller spaces all the time. Tabitha knew people lived in coffins when they died, and wondered if all this moving was a way of getting ready for death. The news said adults were dying earlier and earlier, and sometimes when they were children. The flats to the left and right of their own were boarded up, with 'NO ELECTRICITY' written on one, and 'NO VALUABLES LEFT INSIDE' written on the other. Tabitha had stolen a 'NO TALKING' sign from the exam hall at school, and taped it to their front door, and that was the last time Dad wouldn't look at her. Inside the flat, she sat down on the carpet in front of the T.V and pulled the remote from beneath a crisp packet. Dad's lunch. She turned on the screen, and the words 'Bringing you a smile ' Powered by the Giggle Factory' came on, as they always did, in neon red and orange, before the channel appeared. It was the news. It was always the news. 'No Television.' 'But, Dad'' 'No! No, Television.' Tabitha raised the zapper. On the television, a man shinier than its screen said, 'Do you make people laugh?' 'Tabitha'' he growled from the kitchen, which was to say- from the lounge. As the flat was so small; the oven and the television were in the same room. 'You could be one of the best paid people in the country,' said the man on the television. 'The Giggle Factory needs a new Head Laugher as Professor Floghorn resigned today, saying he just couldn't make people giggle, the way he used to. A worldwide search is underway'' 'Right.' There was the scattering sound of footsteps as her father strode onto the carpet, and toward Tabitha. Tabby looked up. Her Dad's lips were open and moving as though he were being forced to eat a chocolate bar. His hands were white, except at the knuckles, which blushed. His eyes were wide enough to make Tabby gulp. Suddenly there was a Click and the lights went off and the man on the television became a dot that got smaller than an ant, and then smaller than an ant's ankle. The T.V screen crackled. There was another Click as the electricity came back on, and the screen popped back up, with the words, 'We apologise for the temporary loss of power.' Above Tabby's head, the light-bulb hummed and had gone a sickly, yellow colour. 'I'm sorry,' said Tabitha, in a whisper, looking up at her father. Her Dad had stopped and was swaying and breathing long and hard, like someone who had dived into cold water,", "label": 1}
{"text": "and had just come up. He was shivering; his skin pale. 'It's okay. I'm sorry, sweetheart. I just felt a bit' off. Things getting to your old Dad. Money worries, not you, sweetheart.' He dug in his pocket and drew out a five pound note. 'If you want to find out the news, practise your reading, and go get our paper.' The newspaper was their last luxury. They would burn it at night, in the sink, and gather round its heat. 'Okay, Dad.' Tabitha smiled and walked to the door. 'Giggle Factory Laughs Its Head Off' Said the newspaper headline, in black, gravestone writing that did not look at all like laughter. The newspaper continued, 'The Giggle Factory today begins a worldwide hunt for a new Head Laugher, after Professor Floghorn resigned, yesterday. In a evening press conference outside the gates of his Factory, an unsmiling Floghorn read the following statement, 'It has come time to admit to myself that I just can't do it, anymore. I can't make people laugh. There isn't much power left in the Giggle Factory and now is the time to act. I must face the fact that it is time to find a new Head Laugher. If I keep going on trying to pretend I am funny, we could very well completely run out of power and slide back into the Bad Times. Now, begins the search. I am looking for youth. A young person to run this factory for many years. I implore any conscientious citizen out there, anyone who cares about the world and can make people laugh, to come forward. Your World needs you. The Giggle Factory needs you. I need you.' Once he had finished reading, Professor Floghorn returned into his secretive factory, behind their twenty foot high gates. For months now, a riot of rumours have spread, that Floghorn was no longer as funny as he thought he was. Some have said he has been laid low by an infectious virus, others that he became depressed due to his seclusion from society. Last night, one high level employee at the Factory was quoted as saying, 'It's the strain that got to him; of keeping teh World running' The electricity coming. The demand is constant, and he just can't do it anymore. The last time I saw him laugh, really laugh, was when he realised he'd been crying for ten minutes'' ''selfish'' said Tabitha's step-mum; Joan. Tabby looked up from the newspaper. Her face didn't flinch but something inside her belly did. She tried to look down and return to reading, or least pretend she did, in case her step mum looked in. Joan had a thin face and a long nose, and looked, to Tabby, like a pinched witch. Her temper made her think of a witch that had been pinched. Tabby managed to resume reading, 'In our jobs pages, today, The Evening Yell is proud to publish the very first available Head Laugher Application Form.' ''Molly-coddled'' said Joan. The newspaper's text wavered in front of Tabby's eyes, the lines merging into each other like ripples in a pond. She blinked- hard- and each word was back on its own. She gritted her teeth and tried to finish the paragraph, 'The Giggle Factory have said they expect to be swamped with applications, but it would raise a smile, here at The Evening Yell, if one of our readers got through to an interview! Good luck!' 'No wonder she thinks she can do what she likes,' shouted Joan. Her step-mum was in the bathroom, and shouting across the narrow hall to their bedroom. Her Dad crossed between the doors, hands twitching like a poltergeist that couldn't touch anything, and whispering, 'Keep your voice down!' 'I'll do what I like,' her step-mum replied. 'When I work every second of the day, when you sit around and do nothing at all, this bloody family will do what I say!' Her Dad was whispering in reply. Tabby couldn't hear it and didn't want to. Her fingernails were hole-punchers at the edges of the newspaper. Joan continued, 'She'll turn out like you, you know. Bloody useless. What is she going to do, when she's older, without school, without qualifications? Jobs are so hard to come by. What is she going to do ' play stupid pranks and act the fool? Just like you! I'm at my wits end with both of you'' The bathroom door closed but the conversation continued. 'At least I know where she gets it from. Like father like daughter.' Tabby's eyes rippled with tears. There were lots of stray animals these days. Dogs and cats. Every time she saw one, their ribs hanging lower than their bellies, her eyes went wet. Gritting her teeth, and not even knowing it, Tabitha rose and took her newspaper to the door. By the door was a pad of paper, a pen, and the car keys. She took the second and the last, and slipped out onto the street, opened the car door, and slid in. Turning off the overhead light, and working by the street-lighting (before it was turned off, at ten), Tabitha clicked the top of the pen, opened the newspaper to its middle, and began to write. It said, 'Head Laugher Application Form' And 'Name.' And Tabby wrote, 'Tabitha Blatt.' Tabitha Blatt is a Problem Child 'Having a good day, Tabitha?' asked the Headmistress. 'Yes, Miss,' said Tabitha. 'Good girl,' the Headmistress' smile was all teeth and no belief. The chance that the day would not end in a good way hung between them. From behind her glasses, the Headmistress looked at her with eyes that looked like snail shells; round, brown and easily crushed. 'Going to class?' she asked. 'Yes, Miss.' Tabitha did her best simpering, I'm-being-a-good-girl smile in return, which meant no teeth at all, and none of the laughter she felt inside. They passed in the corridor and Tabitha looked behind her as she went through the door", "label": 1}
{"text": "to the dining room. The Headmistress hadn't turned around to do the same. Tabitha wasn't going to her class. She turned right. Not for the first time, she was going to the Headmistress's office. For the first time, she had not been sent. The floor-tiles squeaked beneath her feet as though moderately shocked mice. As she walked she thought about the Head Laugher Application Form. She had been pleased with her answers to, 'Please describe a time you used your hilarity-inducing skills to make somebody wet themselves a little bit.' And to, 'In the workplace, you often need to work as part of a team. Explain how you would fail to take team-members seriously, and how you would make team-members' ideas sound like somebody had farted loudly.' And also to, 'What is the silliest thing you have ever done with peanut butter and a banjo string? Use this full page to answer. Extra sheets are available on request.' What had stumped her was the references. As with any job, the applicant for the Head Laugher post needed to prove that they had the necessary experience. In this case, they had to show they'd been making people laugh until they weed themselves (or at least accidentally farted) for the last five years. Then, Tabitha had remembered yesterday afternoon, and the piece of paper on her Headmistress' desk' Tabitha approached the Headmistress' door, which was shut. 'Oh, not again, Tabby,' said the receptionist who, yesterday, had phoned her father. Tabitha nodded sadly. She couldn't look at the woman ' there was too much happiness in Tabby's eyes. Tabitha knocked on the Headmistress's door. 'I don't think she's in, dear,' said the receptionist. Tabitha didn't turn around but said- from the corner of her mouth ' and in an older voice, 'Come in!' 'Oh,' said the receptionist and, as Tabitha hesitated, she added. 'Go on. You'd better get it over with. It'd only be worse if she has to come out to get you.' Shoulders hunched, head down, Tabitha opened the door and stepped into the office. The room was empty. In the older, posher voice, Tabitha said. 'Tabitha! Not again! Well, shut the door!' It was the kind of voice she imagined an owl would have, if it wore glasses, and worked in a school. She shut the door. 'What have you done now?' Tabby said, using the owl-voice to disguise the sound of her footsteps walking to the filing cabinet by the window. 'It wasn't my fault,' she whined, as she slid open the top drawer. 'It was that Susan.' 'Well, it's not good enough, Tabitha Blatt,' Tabitha said. She found the file-divider that said 'Tabitha Blatt'. It was the thickest in the docket. 'It's always one excuse or another. How long is this going to go on?' 'She called me a rude name!' she said, pulling out the file in her name. The first entry bore yesterday's date, and read, - Tabitha, wearing a large, blue and white costume, led a group of Nursery children off the school premises. Tabitha advised she just 'wanted to make the little children laugh'. Parents were called and Tabitha went home an hour early. The first entry on the first page read, - Tabitha Blatt stole a tape recorder from her teacher, Mrs Miggins. Tabitha then recorded the sound of herself farting, in the toilet. After this, during lunchtime, she selo-taped the tape recorder to the bottom of a chair belonging to Mary Fesner, who was to read out an essay, in class. At some point before this reading, Tabitha pressed play on the tape recorder and Mary's reading was accompanied by the farting sounds that came from under her chair. The sounds were set to get progressively louder, so Mary did not notice them, until all of the rest of the children were laughing. - Tabitha later claimed Mary Fesner had been bullying her. 'She had been,' whispered Tabitha, to herself. The reception outside sounded too quiet. Tabitha knew the receptionist must be listening, and shouted loudly, 'Young lady, if you don't sort yourself out; you'll be for the high jump!' (Tabby didn't know what this Idiom meant, but ' whenever Mrs Wilbur shouted it - it made her worry about Sports Day.) Tabitha lifted her jumper and slid the sheaf of paperwork into her trousers, before pulling her jumper back down. 'I've had enough,' she shouted at the door, in the Headmistress-Voice. 'You stupid, little idiot! Get out of my sight. Do you think I come to school every day to deal with brats like you! You have well and truly made my cheese go off!' Tabitha slid the filing cabinet closed and went to door. 'Go. Go on, get out of here.' Tabby opened the door, but stepped back from its crack. 'I tell you what; I want to be in the Caribbean, with a glass in my hand, with bloody alcohol in the glass. With somebody rubbing sun tan lotion into my back! GET LOST TABITHA BLATT. YOU ARE A PROBLEM CHILD! AND CLOSE THE BLOODY DOOR!' Closing the door and sobbing into her hands, Tabitha ran past the reception, into the corridor. There, she slowed, straightened, and went back to her class. The receptionist stared at the closed office-door. Her hands gripped the lunchtime register she had been adding up. She wasn't very good at maths, and had spent thirty minutes trying to force the numbers to make sense. She blinked and decided against going to talk to the Headmistress. She decided, furthermore, to forget all about what she had just heard. Just as she was doing a very good job of doing this, the Headmistress walked by and entered her office, closing the door behind her. After staring and shrugging for awhile, the receptionist gave up on the lunch register and pushed back her black, swivel chair, and swivelled in it, staring out of the window at the rain that was falling. The rain continued to do this,", "label": 1}
{"text": "which was reassuring, at least. Lamb Cutlets, Chips, No Tomato Sauce ''And so comedian Billy Hiccup becomes the first person to be interviewed by The Giggle Factory,' the television said. For a moment, Tabby forgot that her step-mum; Joan, would soon be walking through the front door. It was six o'clock- a time that she dreaded every day; the time Joan came home from work - but Tabby didn't notice the clock. Her hand was wrapped around the remote control. It was tingling at the fingers. Her fingers had felt the same, tingly way when they'd posted her Head Laugher Application Form, earlier that day. (She had placed the Disciplinary Report in the Application Form, where it said; Insert Your References Here.) 'Billy Hiccup's invitation to the interview, to be held on the twelfth of February, came today,' continued the television. The opening of the front door made her remember her step-mum. It was the dull, deep click of her heart sinking into her stomach. Tabby couldn't concentrate on what the TV said, next, 'Billy Hiccup, winner of Funniest Teenager in the World for the last three years, has been described as the naughtiest, living comedian.' Tabitha sank back into the settee, as her Dad said, 'We're home!' 'Hello,' said Tabby, so quietly only the sofa would hear her. 'Anyone home?' he asked. He knew she was there, just as he knew Tabitha and her step-mother would never love each other. 'There you are!' he said, and again, 'We're home!' 'I said 'hello',' said Tabby, pretending to watch the television. She couldn't remember what it was talking about and could think of nothing but the sound of Joan's shoes on the cream carpet, as she walked to the kitchen. They made a soft, meaty thudding sound; the same as stabbing a chicken breast. Her step-mum cluttered pans from the cupboard and onto the hobs, rattled gas out of the oven, and ignited it with the long, thin lighter that hung beside the grill. 'I'll do the cooking, sweetheart; you've been at work all day,' said Dad. 'No it's okay. I'll do it,' said Tabitha's step-mother, and she did. She didn't look at Tabby, and hadn't since walking in. 'Did you get the tomato ketchup?' her step-mum asked. Tomato ketchup was what the Blatts ate, by way of vegetables. 'Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart,' said Tabitha's Dad. 'I forgot' I really am sorry.' Joan didn't reply. Tabitha used the silence to concentrate on the T.V, sliding forward on her seat and flicking channels. There were hundreds of channels. Tabby liked the Idiom; 'too-many-cooks-spoil 'the-broth' and at least fifty of the channels showed cooking programs. People had one or two meals these days, and no longer three, and looking at food had become a national pastime. She had once asked her father what 'broth' was, and he had said 'soup'. The cooking programs hardly ever showed soup, although they did have lots of cooks- so many Tabby couldn't remember all of their names, even though they were supposed to be famous. On the other channels, there was reality T.V, or news, and all of it was bad. Except this; 'In breaking news, Billy Hiccup - the World's rudest comic - has been invited for an interview at The Giggle Factory. Our reporters caught up with him ' and his agent; Charlotte de Vintri, outside his New York home.' 'I've had a long day,' said her step-mum, to her Dad. 'And I have a headache.' The words were meant for Tabitha to hear, but Tabitha wasn't listening. Billy Hiccup was about to speak. 'Sweetheart, could you turn it down, please?' said her Dad, coming closer, and leaning in. Tabby could smell his breath. It smelt scared. Tabby turned down the sound and edged closer to the end of the sofa-cushion, lowering her head toward the T.V. set, so she could watch Billy Hiccup. He had appeared on the screen, outside a glass door, chewing gum. His hands were in his pockets. Next to him was a red-haired woman, with crimson lips, and bloodshot eyes. Billy Hiccup stared at the camera, and was chewing gum by the mouth-full. It made his teeth look at least twice as big as they should be. 'Yeah,' said Billy Hiccup. 'I didn't even send in an application form to get this interview at the Giggle Factory. Old Professor Floghorn had to send an application form to me. He's lucky I accepted, and said I'd go. The world's lucky I accepted! I'm so funny, when I get the job of Head Laugher I'm gonna make enough electricity to turn the moon into a disco light! We'll be dancing all night long.' Beside him, the red-haired woman laughed. 'Oh, Billy is so funny! He's so the funniest! The most, most funniest!' she said. The reporter could be heard, asking, 'And how do you feel to be the first interviewee at the Factory?' Billy smiled. 'How do I feel?' he said. 'With my fingers!' He removed his hand from his jeans and wiggled his fingers in a wave, and said, 'Gotta go! I'm a busy, busy man.' Now, he spoke to the camera. 'I'll catch you on February the twelfth, Floghorn. If I have room in my busy schedule.' After this, he left the screen, leaving the red-haired woman staring at the camera. 'He's so nice,' she said. 'Just so, so nice.' Clatter Tabby jolted on the sofa as her step mum dropped the dish she had been washing and turned to her father, who was still drying up, and said, 'That T.V really is giving me a migraine, now. You know full well I've been at work since seven.' Her Dad looked at Tabitha. He was carrying a steaming plate of lamb and chips. The lamb looked old and dry and leathery and wrinkled, much like her father's forehead. He was frowning. Tabby turned off the T.V., and her Dad put down the plate. It clattered on the table. Tabitha knew", "label": 1}
{"text": "his fingers were shaking, under it. 'Is there any tomato ketchup?' Tabby asked, politely. 'No, sweetheart,' he replied, and, even though he was smiling, his lips shook like his fingers. Blood Mrs Wilbur was a tall woman and towered all the more when she was angry. Tabby thought she had seen tower blocks that did less towering. 'Put the saw down. Did I tell you to touch the saws?' said the teacher. Tabby put the saw down. Mrs Wilbur continued to stare at her. Some of the windows in a tower block would have looked away by now, thought Tabby. 'Right,' said Mrs Wilbur. 'John, you go with Nathan. Adam and Cheryl, you go together. What? WHAT? How many times have I told you ' you're working with a girl. Grow up and get used to it. Right? Deal with it!' At the beginning of the year, Adam would have said 'Eurgggh; not with a girl!' Now, he just gulped. 'Susan and Tabitha, Patrick and Frank, Michael and Laura. One of you will pick up the saw, the other will hold the wood.' Tabitha glanced at Susan. Susan was staring at her, as she had since the poo-on-her-pants incident. Most of the time, Susan said nothing and didn't move at all. Occasionally, she twitched. Now she was touching the metal teeth of the saw-blade and smiling a small smile that serial killers would have seen before, in their mirrors. 'I don't want any nonsense,' said Mrs Wilbur. 'You two have to learn to work together.' 'I'm going to cut you,' whispered Susan. She was a lanky child and the slight dribble that appeared on her lip took a long time to fall to the floor-tiles. Susan didn't seem to notice, and didn't wipe her mouth, and the drool's remains hung from her chin like a speech bubble that had just popped. 'Um, Miss?' Tabitha raised her hand. 'Look for the pencil markings you made earlier. Attach your wood to the vices, and hold the other end. The other end. The other end. THE OTHER END!' 'Miss!' Tabitha's hand twisted in the air as she twizelled her right leg. She made a face that said 'toilet', as clearly as her legs did. 'What?' (Mrs Wilbur didn't like to be interrupted.) 'I need the toilet, Miss.' 'Fine!' 'You don't have any friends,' whispered Susan, as she passed her. 'You'll never have any friends. Not in this school.' 'Poo-pants,' whispered Tabitha. Susan made a grinding noise that sounded like it came from her saw, but came, instead, from her teeth. Tabitha left the classroom by the door that creaked, stopped at the art cupboard, looked around, picked out a red paint bottle, and went to the toilet. Entering a cubicle, she closed and locked the door, and squeezed half of the paint into the toilet then flushed it several times before it went away. After this, she went to the sinks and, checking the toilet was still empty, refilled the squeezy bottle with water. Closing the lid, she shook it, stuffed it down the right sleeve of her cardigan, and returned to the classroom. She managed not to skip, though her feet wanted to. Susan's smile had grown since Tabitha had been away. It clearly said, without any words coming out of it; 'It's time to cut you...' 'There's the wood,' said Susan, instead, nodding at the table top while her eyes stared at Tabitha. 'Don't hurt me, please,' said Tabitha, managing to blink as though she had tears to blink away. Susan's smile got big enough to nearly be a laugh. Tabitha held the wood. Susan didn't seem to notice that she held it with her left hand, or that her right hand was hidden inside her cardigan's sleeve. With a hiss, Susan slashed at Tabby with the saw. Fast as a viper, Tabitha withdrew her left arm and brought up her right arm. This hand was bent down inside the sleeve. Hidden in the curve of her palm was a squeezy paint bottle with the lid flipped open. Tabitha squeezed it and screamed. 'WHAT?' Mrs Wilbur screamed in return. 'Susan cut her!' 'Susan cut her!' said at least two children, at once. Tabitha screamed again and squeezed the bottle and red spurted from what looked like the stump of a right wrist. 'Oh My God,' said Mrs Wilbur, in a whisper. The paint hit the wall as Tabitha staggered. Smile shaking until it fell right off her face, Susan retreated to the wall. 'You cut my hand off,' screamed Tabitha. 'No,' she added, with a sob. 'Nooooooo.' 'No,' said Susan, almost in agreement, as Tabitha shuffled toward her, squeezing. Red paint hit the wall by Susan's face. 'No,' repeated Susan. There were tears in her eyes. A moment latter, there was watery paint. Tabitha collapsed to her knees, squirting up Susan's top. She crawled forward, grasping the girl's legs and hips with her left hand. Pushing herself against Susan, Tabby pumped the paint bottle where it was caught between their two bodies. Paint hit the ceiling. 'Why? Why did you have to do that? Anything but my right hand! How will I do my exams now?' wailed Tabitha. Mrs Wilbur opened her mouth and closed it. Her body didn't seem to be working. The tower, if anything, had collapsed. 'Help me' help me,' Tabitha moaned, as she slumped against Susan. If Susan could have pressed herself harder against the wall, she would have made a hole and disappeared through it. 'Oh My God, help me,' said Tabitha, pawing at Susan's shoes, which were no longer polished black, and were now bright red. The paint bottle was running out. 'Oh My God,' whispered Tabitha, as she dissolved into a trickle of giggles. She was laughing so hard, tears were trickling down her cheeks. 'You should see your face.' 'Get a first aider' Get a first aider' Get a first aider'' said Mrs Wilbur, thinking Tabitha was crying, until she heard the sound", "label": 1}

(I should know, God is a manager where I work, and there's no-one better than managers and Gods for making up bullshit, is there?) 1) The right not to reap 2) The right to reap at a jaunty, carefree speed 3) The right not to finish a booking 4) The right to mistake a badly written book for a real Death 5) The right to reap anything 6) The right to reap them again, no matter how much they scream 7) The right to reap anywhere 8) The right to dip in, especially with a long blade 9) The right to reap loudly, again- no matter how much they scream 10) The right to be quiet, no matter how much you want to rage against the dying of the light, Dylan Numbers. It doesn't matter which middle manager 'Buddha, Odin, Jesus, Satan, St Peter, Hades, Hel - is reminding you of how many lives you need to close by the next quarter; it's always numbers, numbers. People are dying in record numbers. In my catchment area, between 1600 and last year the number of annual deaths has risen, like the blade of my scythe when harvesting them, exponentially. It's nearly 600,000, now. Think of the daily workload. In the beginning of mankind, we would remember the names of the dying. At the advent of tribes, we would write them on the back of our hand-bones in charcoal. By the time of townships, though, we needed lists. Lists on papyrus, then parchment, then paper, then processing chips. We used to have strong unions, us Grimms, but Thatcher put pay to that, didn't she? The lady may not have been for turning but she spins a fair amount in her grave, I can tell you. Now we've got call centres, and Deaths sitting in their rabbit-hutch-workstations, worrying away at their keyboards. Make the call. Close the case. Write their history. Repeat. It's a fast-paced world as a bringer of doom. I work at a call centre in a disused corner of a spacious business park, for a company that trades as Life Ltd. There are no incoming calls. The calls we make are exclusively cold. Death never sleeps. Life may be a bitch but it's nothing compared with being a Grimm. I'm run down and have this rattling cough I can't seem to shift. I'm bones-tired. Yes, all of them. Sometimes, I sit and bend and retch, but nothing comes up and I think it's just stress. In the morning, the scene in my mirror resembles a painting by Munch. I'd take time off, but there's few illnesses a Death can claim. They only believe rickets the first couple of times, before you have to start bending your own bones. I've seen Grimm Reapers more ancient than I become brittle, and flake not break, until they fade away like the specks in the After of a shampoo advert. I never used to consider this, not when I was a young Death in my first few millennia, but sometimes you have to cut corners if a working stiff merely wishes to get by. This guide is a Death's how-to-survive. Next time Odin winks at you in that flirtatious way of his, or Satan threatens you with being fired, remind them of these 'your ' rights of a reaper. The right not to reap Worm holes have a habit of leading to dead bodies. We, the Deaths, travel by them, waiting by our computers in our rabbit hutches, for the click in our headsets as we hit the next on the list, and we're connected without dialling. It doesn't matter if they pick up, we make our call anyway. Down a wormhole, like those imagined between galaxies in movies, but danker, wetter, loamy like those used by, well' worms. Ring, ring. There's an inevitability to worms. Go down their body, you'll come to an end and your body will come to the same, when it's finished. But on occasion, worms twist off their reputation for the inevitable, and turn, and it's the same with a Death. This is one of those occasions. Suffolk, matins, hours before the coronation of Henry VIII, 1509. The boy's eyes stared out at forty five degrees from his cheeks, cheeks which were sunken flat. He lay on sandy loam and his face, cheeks and forehead and all, carried some of it. From the struggle. They say forty five degrees is the best angle at which to pitch a stone, for the furthest carry, and the boy's eyes were suitably far away, and round and small and hard and cracked where their blood vessels had broken. The dilated pupils gave the impression they had been holed, like prehistoric jewellery. He ' the boy 'was now further gone even", "label": 1}
{"text": "than the eyes. Soul departed. I approached the boy from the grassy bank, my skeletal feet not yet leaving their impression in the sand at the river's edge. I passed his Death on the way down. I would have said it was like strangers passing in the night, but I knew this Death, and it was daytime. We ' the other Death and I- raise a hand as we pass, rather as bus drivers do these days, though this particular day is long before buses, or drivers, and is the time of horses, and Houses, and a catechismal schism. He's here for the boy. Me, I'm here for the killer. The river before me is a Thames tributary. The killer had come this far with his fellow county-men, Cornishmen, to sack London. They had razed sheep stead, and raped any mammal they could find all the way from Wessex to this estuary. The morning fog had lifted from the river and the boy's body, rising and lifting as it gave up its grip on the land. The warmth of the sun cleaves my robes cloyingly to my bones. Standing above the boy with his burst guts and stony gaze ' entrails unravelling skyward as the fog had ' the sun on my face-bones is pleasant. 'Likes the liver of little boys,' I say, of the killer, because it sounds as pleasing as the sunshine, and because it is the truth. I would have gone for the organ by the base of the boy's ribcage, but not this Cornish killer. He started at the groin and made quite the mess and, more clumsy again, had slipped mid struggle, banging his temple on a stone, and was head-down in the river's edge, dying from drowning. I'm here to collect him. Not his body, with its gangling outsized limbs and jawline, lantern-like though he wasn't very bright, not really. No, I'm here for his soul. But it's so nice in the sun. I pause at the water's edge, and I lower myself to sit on the sand, and pull my robes up to my knees. (Nothing indecent, I'm not skinny dipping.) I dapple the soles of my foot bones in the water like dropped leaves, flat on the surface, cooling. I relax back onto my spine. The sand is soft in its grooves, even through my shroud. I blur my arms, making sand angels in the river bank. Suddenly, the Cornishman splutters, and rises. He staggers up to the bank, falls, gathers his far flung limbs and stumbles into the thicket that closes on the river, here. Then, he's gone, but not in the way he was supposed to be. Oops, I think. The Death charged with the Cornishman's next victim would be far from pleased. Oh well, I think, and make small silver-backed-fish ripples in the water with my toe bones. The right to reap at a jaunty, carefree speed Picture yourself at the movies watching The Matrix starring Keanu Reeves. Now there's a movie about the ending of an idea like no other: an idea that had taken over most of humanity's minds. (See later: the Right to reap anything.) You would as little listen to Leonard Cohen for his arias as watch Reeves for his range of facial expression, yet you know exactly what he is feeling. Being a Death demands the same blank faced palette and I can tell you, at the end, when you stare into my face bare of any muscles that can form frown or smile, you will still be acutely aware of any emotion of which I might be possessed. (Mostly, it's boredom.) As a Death; lose your emotions, make of yourself an unfired vessel ready to be painted with the scene. Empty yourself, that's the key, as any skeleton would confirm. There have been those who have gone rogue of course. The skeletal actor in cartoon's He Man springs to mind, a Death that could never say no to a mirror, or 'see you later' for that matter, who spent most of his spare time pumping iron, and the rest of it pumping up inflatable muscles under lilac Lycra. What did he used to say..? ' 'People of Eternia, I stand before the great eye of the galaxy.' This was impossible. He was the great egotistical I of the galaxy and would forever show off his 'muscles' to fellow Deaths. He even gave himself a stage name. It sounded like a skeleton with dyslexia. People of Eternia, I ask you. Still, once in a while a Death has to break out, not in a bubonic plague kind of way but in a rash of excitement. Break free. I like to skip. There are few places in Life Ltd's call centre not covered by CCTV, but in certain corridors I will break into a number from the Sound of Music or Glee. (My favourite is We Are Young, by Fun.) Dancing is the only thing that stops these old bones aching. From time to time on a call, I'll materialise some way from the dying ' purposefully, so - and skip to them, scythe hissing through the wind as does the air though my teeth, sounding like a ditty whistled in by a tone-death stammerer. As I go skipping merrily by, spare wrist flapping, skull set perkily to an angle that says 'I'm taking Death one second at a time' I'll harvest their souls with a luxurious flick, with a whirligig of reaping. Occasionally, such as on the death days of particular hypocrites, I'll dress in a pink shroud and chunky designer glasses. Once, while a paedophilic priest received his last rites, I danced Gangham style in the corner. As his anointer said the words 'May the Lord Jesus Christ protect you and lead you to eternal life,\" I sang 'eh sexy lady' while thrusting my hips. He wasn't happy, but then he would have been less pleased with what awaited him beyond me, so", "label": 1}
{"text": "my gyrating hips may well have been the highlight of his dying. I never, however, dress as a Bee Gee. There is a limit. The right not to finish a booking If an Alice had drunk too much of a drink labelled 'drink me' enough to dance on a head of a pin, and to tumble down a worm instead of a rabbit hole, then she may have found herself in the strange places I have been. Many men die in bed and thence in their dreams, or in feverish hallucinations, or in opiate soaked realities and I have travelled to them all. I have even been to space. Sartorially, it suited me. I have been to palaces of every sized Khan, from every Kublai through big to small, to Wonderland and Neverland, and all the lands between Never and Wonder. But it is the mundane, unsurprisingly, which is the more everyday. The prisons, hospitals, the homes, the nursing homes. And only twice have I not done my duty and taken out the dead. You wouldn't have thought it was my right to just not finish a booking, but every rule needs its exceptions, and there are no rules stronger than taxes and me. Suicide clinic, Zurich, Switzerland, yesterday. Admittedly, this first setting should not be mundane. It had been made, however, to look it. 'The rooms are set up to be'' said the Swiss doctor in his accent with words so clipped they almost bled, '' just like home. Photos are brought by the client or their family, paintings, flowers from the garden. One customer even bought his favourite lounge chair, a soft Chesterfield, thirty years in the family, I believe.' I wasn't there to hear the doctor, of course. Our time, though endless, is short - case by case, but much of it is spent on suicides. In the United Kingdom, suicide is the leading cause of death amongst men under thirty-four, and the numbers are rising. 4531 last year. Slash my wrists, this, asphyxiation by hanging, that. By the end of December, I was at the end of my tether. I was here to harvest not a man but a woman. Her eyes and lips are both a delicate red, near the border of pink, and appeared fragile. Red as a lark's tongue. The medical oddments of the suicide clinic are hidden from view, or muted, so that I can't hear the beeps of the monitors and can only see the transparent tubes that end in her body. Her skin, except at the lips and eyelids, is the same shade of pale. A Noman's land grey, shelled, a husk. She is fading. Perhaps, only I can see this. She has cancer, but it is as hidden by the craft of the onsite makeup artist. (They doubled as the embalmer.) Her family sit about her, offspring of her loins girding her, as though they can hold me back. A son on the one hand, a daughter on the other, the husband untethered and bobbing about the room, as awkward as a balloon at a wake. Or at a death. The doctor nods. A hidden switch is flipped. My call button, I suppose. Security, please escort this woman from the building. Quietly as possible, please. No fuss, we're Swiss. No. Not this time. I won't. I've had it up to the earholes with you suicide clinics. Pains in the coccyx. She closes her slight red eyes. She smiles a little smile with her lark-tongue lips. Her heart stops with a liquid shrug. Her brain goes south, segment by segment. She looks just as though she might be sleeping. She is. She wakes, one eye opening then the other, the second pupil staring in an upward direction. The daughter screams and jumps away from her mother's hand as though a cat grabbed by the tail. The son can't, caught in a death grip where's there's no death, apart from me, looking on and laughing at the look on the doctor's face. The mother burps, and says, 'Awk.' The husband is screaming at the doctor. 'What's gone wrong? She's supposed to be at peace. What the fuck?.. What' What the' What'' The doctor flips the switch. Flick, flip, flick. Flippity flick. His blank expression has sharpened. It has the look of someone who would quite like a knife. His eyes narrow. The mother begins to absentmindedly eat her lark-tongue lips. The top one rips and dribbles blood onto her chin. Ho-ho, I think, I've had my fun, and I finally take her life. The right to mistake a badly written book for a real Death My soul dies a little every time I read a children's book written by a celebrity. They should have their own font called Celebrity instead of Calibri or, perhaps, New Times Showman, or just: Insipid Self-Promoting Egotistical Fuckdoll of Supermarket-Publisher Tie-ins. They would use this for any word they think a child would find interesting or something to do with bodily functions or just a sound. Why does a Death have a healthy interest in children's literature? As Jack Frost always gets a chilly reception, Sinbad the Sailor often partakes in naughty, piratical acts, so the Reaper's Day is unrelentingly grim (even when skipping). At its end, I don't want to crack open a book of adult fiction, with its Pandora's Box of swearing, violence, and the exposed boxes of women who may or may not be called Pandora. No, I want the innocence and lightness of children's books, where if the ineffable voids of existence and death are to be touched, the touching is done in metaphor, or analogy, or in the anthropomorphism of cuddly, huggable creatures. (As a walking, talking skeleton, I'm much in favour of animism.) With the works of celebrity authors, it's hard to relax into a plot that reads like something that Roald Dahl chewed over, choked on, accidentally swallowed, puked up half of, and then diarrhoea-d the rest out over", "label": 1}
{"text": "a sweaty night of the shits. I have a very detailed and well-rehearsed plan for turning every single one of these frauds, whether they used one or not, into a ghost-writer. The right to reap anything Recently a Grim had to take time off with stress. He covered Africa, his assigned species mosquitos. I can only imagine his Death-list. Saying this, only ever taking humans can become boring. For an enterprising reaper, there is always the chance to take without being noticed. May I suggest killing off one of the following, as variety is the spice of death. Sayings- I can claim the pleasure of throwing 'Land O Scot's' into an early etymological grave. I don't want to appear embittered, but the Scottish have never wanted to be part of the UK. Life Ltd. 's call centre is based just outside of Torquay (if you've ever been, you'll understand why) and the Scots have railed for centuries against the services that the English provide. This, obviously, includes Death. The Scots have taken issue on several occasions with reapers taking them, on average, ten years before that of their conquerors. No Scotsman has ever referred to me as having 'nee airs and fucking graces, ya know'. I am, after all, 93% air. I have often suggested, in an accent somewhere between mid-range private school and mockney, that they drink a little less and smile a little more, but, when I turn up they're all for drunkenness and frowning. To be honest, the English have the same reaction. 'Land o'Scots' used to be a term referring to heaven. a) If I was to let anybody into heaven it wouldn't be that bunch of moaners and; b) There isn't a heaven and; c) There is a hell. A little unfair, perhaps, but there you go. These items made killing the phrase particularly pleasurable, to be honest. 'To be honest' is the next saying on my list. Ideas ' I can only envy the big reapers in Russia who have taken a scythe to communism. For me, I have enjoyed killing racism a little, only to allow it resurrect as xenophobia, and then reaping it again, only for it to rise as prejudice. (See the section on 'dipping in'.) The BNP died and UKIP formed. The BBC may sack Jeremy Clarkson but he'll rise again somewhere closer to Hell on British TV. Long live Good Morning Britain. Fashion ' Mullets. Nothing does a shorter back and sides than a reaper with a scythe. The right to reap them again I do like a good fire, the warmth seeping into my bones. Contrary to popular opinion, I feel and look great when warmed up. Back in the beginning, men hadn't invented fire and I had it all to myself' then along came Prometheus. The git. Well, we all know the story of Prometheus and how he ends, there's no need to go on about it, though it goes on for him, and on and on, and on days when I'm not at work, I'll visit him, at sunrise, and watching the eagle put its claws on the skin of his stomach. Listen to the tearing before the screams begin. The mountain slopes smell of dew, particularly in the spring. Go on; breathe it in. It's as refreshing as the screams. In the evening, if I'm not on the night shift, I'll go round the sunset side of the mountain and pay a visit to Jimmy Saville. 'Now then..' I'll whisper, 'Now'' and watch the golden eagle have its dinner. It's hard not to smile, being Death, but I enjoy the moment when it rips his golden tracksuit. The sunset is so pretty, and so red. The right to reap anywhere [Life Ltd force Operational Chart 'grims/gods/nothing above god'] As the lowest ranks on the force operational chart, Grimms have few privileges. - We have two percent Do-not-Disturb time away from the telephone. This is to include writing case histories and going for a smoke. - Sick days are restricted. If a Grimm takes three separate periods of sick leave in one year, a temporary disciplinary note will be placed on their file. - No reaping at work. Breaking the last rule can result in a gross misconduct. There are reminders everywhere. [signage] This is on all payslips, for obvious reasons. Still, some things are worth getting sacked over. Murdering the Buddha was one of those things. What? Easy-going? Happy? You should have heard his motivational speeches. Buddha: Oh, yes. Me: (but only thinking it) Oh, no. Buddha high-fived his way along the line of Deaths. If I'd had a heart it would have sunk to where my stomach should have been. I did have a bad feeling in my bones. Buddha paused as he reached me. Buddha: 'Haaaaaaay.'Lips smiling as widely as his cheeks would allow. Me: 'Hay?' The five digits were still high. I didn't move. His hand went down and out to the side, mirrored by the other. Bingo wings fluttered his orange robes from within. Buddha: 'My favourite Death!' Me: 'Oh?' He's going to hug me, I thought like a twitching metronome, he's going to hug me, he's going to hug me, he's going to' He hugged me. Buddha: 'Do you know how you make me feel?' Whispered into my earhole. My skull echoed. Me: 'Zen?' He shook his head. His body and orange cloth followed suit. Me: 'Ecstatic?' The shake, again. I began to wish none of my bones led to another bone. Me: 'Nirvanic?' Buddha: 'Dude!' He disengaged. I felt his skin sucker on for an additional moment, before squelching loose. 'Come with me!' Here we go, I thought, and got up, and went after him. We walked to the lift between the lines of Deaths and the sound of Reaper's dialling out and connecting with their targets.

The doors tolled open and the Buddha led us past a door bearing the legend 'Odin', past and Satan's corner suite, to his own office. Buddha pointed out a meditation mat and said 'sit'. He was no longer smiling, his lips having lost in their battle against his cheeks. There was no desk only a series of throws. Buddha squatted opposite me in the Lotus position, pressed his palms together, and said, 'What the fuck was that?' Namaste, I thought. I had suffered through several of these 'Karmic' meetings and they were always a bitch. Every-time I felt a little more like crying. Of course, like a blocked pipe, I couldn't, not even a drip, and I definitely couldn't explode. That was against several workplace ordinances. Still, the pressure built. His eyes were of coal, all of the life pressed out of them by the tectonic weights of his brows. They gave the impression of being a match away from a blaze. 'Is that how you've been fucking trained, is it?' Pause. He stares. I think; head bone connected to the neck bone, neck bone connected to the shoulder bone. Just trying to get through it without breaking down. He goes again. I try to follow his training and live in the moments in which he isn't shouting. Buddha: 'Well, IS IT? THIS ISN'T FUNNY!' Me: 'I'm not grinning.' It was, of course, impossible for me not to. Inside, I just wanted to cry or die, but was incapable of either. Buddha: 'Fucking Naraka! I back you up you know, I say that one's a maverick yes, but he's like the George Best of Deaths, he shits talent, you know. And you fucking pull this nonsense. You can't just make up your own rules.' I wondered what it was this time. Deaths per hour? Failing to cross-sell a place in purgatory? Not asking if their widows have life assurance? This job, believe it or not, used to be customer service. Enough. In the shadow under the end of my robes, I lifted a finger. Not to swear, no; to point. And all of the frustration, the rage, of all those fucking centuries of being a working stiff and getting nowhere, achieving nothing but dust, came flowing out of that bony digit, and into him. A line of blood ran down from his nose, over his rose bud lips, to the first of his chins then across the second, and in candy cane coloured hook, the third. There, it disappeared into a fold. I'll get a written warning for this. I'd only escape gross misconduct because obesity was a risk factor for strokes. Without blinking, I got up, and returned to the call centre floor, and to my work-station. The right to dip in Thoreau was wrong. The life of a man is not one of quiet desperation, but one of quiet expiration. The dreams die first, the material expectations later, and the hair follicles last, taking the last of his dignity. I can kill them off bit by bit like popping bubbles as they rise seeking the sky. Writers are the most fun, for this. Fantasy-wise, no-one lives in a bigger bubble. Let me sketch a writer, raggedly dressed, badly shaven, as grey as the pencil with which I am sketching, in his hair follicles and in the pallor of his skin, and in his personality. He's put all of himself into his writing, and what good has that done him? I wouldn't draw in b, not with a 9b or 2b. there's nothing soft left in his harried expression. No, I draw in d - 9d - as he's been hardened by the writer's life. It hasn't given him an inch. His progress, after all those years, can only be measured in millimetres. Faint praise here, a good score on Youwriteon.com there. The 9d best defines the wrinkles that have entrenched around eyes which are themselves brittle ' kicked-aluminium-can eyes. They're empty. If he's in grey, his setting is charcoal, heavy-handed and leaning in. A train station, maybe. A bus stop, perhaps. He can't afford a car and hasn't gotten around to learning how to drive. Geniuses don't, do they? The other mortals in my sketch are done in oils. Layered on in vibrant colour and jutting out in 3d. He slips between them like an errant pencil line, like the mistake his life is turning out to be, like the lines he wrote that go nowhere, got him nowhere, and he's fading, going out not with a bang nor a whimper but with all the sound of a piece of paper blowing away or the wheeze of your breath giving out as you read this sentence. Line by pencil line, I take from the writer. I think that's fair. Writers think they can be more than the other mortals, they bend and pitch and shoot for immortality, to be read for ever. As an agent of eternity, I take exception to that, of course. Line by line I rub him out, until he can't be bothered to write one, anymore, and is utterly erased inside. Much later, I return for his body. The right to reap out loud Spontaneous human combustion has been scientifically debunked. Refuted by Dr John de Haan, who proved it to be the 'wick effect' by proofing a pig in ethanol. Given a small accelerant, such as a cigarette, the pig would combust in its own fat, leaving only the extremities of its legs, which did not light because the alcohol would not souse the body fat in that area of the sow. If you'll forgive me, what a load of hogwash. I'm the accelerant. From time to time, I'll take a mortal by burning them alive. These, at least, go out with a bang.
